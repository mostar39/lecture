2020/04/19,Karma Revero GTE: All-Electric Performance Car Due In 2021,"The Karma Revero GTE is built on the company’s new “skateboard” platform.
Two versions will initially be available, with a hyper-range version on the way.
Remember the Karma from a while back? It was called the Fisker Karma and Justin Bieber drove a chrome one around SoCal. The car looked nice, but it was not well-received and ended up earning a failing grade from Consumer Reports. Well, they nearly folded and Henrik Fisker eventually resigned after the company’s financial practices were called into question.
Today the new owners, Chinese auto parts supplier Wanxiang Group, seem poised to turn things around. Karma Automotive, now the name of the new company, have been announcing details about the Karma 2.0. It’s called the Karma Revero now instead of the Karma, with the GTE being the latest version. And if the tech preview we have so far holds, there could be another serious player in the EV market.
What Is the Karma Revero GTE?
Although it won’t be out until next year, the Karma Revero GTE will be the Southern California-based company’s latest all-electric vehicle. The Revero GTE joins the GTS, GT, and just plain Revero as the fourth model in Karma Automotive’s lineup. The Revero GTE will roll out as two versions, both of which come in 200-mile and 300-mile range configurations.
Later in 2021 there will be 400-mile, hyper-range version available.
Like I said, this will make the Karma Revero GTE a serious competitor to Polestar, Tesla, Porsche and the like, assuming the quality is there this time around. The Revero GTE, according to the company, offers levels of performance, technology, and luxury that place the car firmly in the high-end ranks. In other words, this is not a bare bones EV, and not the Karma from a few years ago.
“The Revero GTE is a testament to Karma’s future and a continuation of the success of our definitive luxury electric Revero GT,” said Vlad Kalika, Vice President of Powertrain at Karma Automotive. “The GTE adds diversity to our growing product range, and ushers in a new era of pure all-electric technology – something we are proud to offer both our customers and the mobility industry.”

Platform & Performance
The Revero GTE is built on the Karma E-Flex Platform, which has the now rather familiar “skateboard” layout. In addition to accommodating the new GTE, the E-Flex Platform itself is marketed by Karma Automotive as one that provides new electric mobility solutions to partners across the industry. Which can also be read as, “Hey! Our E-Flex Platform can be used by any other car manufacturer. Hint! Hint!”
Performance-wise, the 2021 Revero GTE is said to go from zero to 60 in less than 3.9 seconds, which is okay, but not Porsche Taycan levels of stellar. The Revero GTE also features electronic torque vectoring for better handling. Other than that, Karma Automotive hasn’t revealed much else on the performance front but things do look promising.

Karma Revero GTE Charging Capability
The forthcoming Revero GTE will be offered in two models initially, with the hyper-range version (400 miles) due a short time later. There’s the standard-range model that can go 200 miles on a full charge using a 75kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt lithium-ion battery. The extended-range version can get 300 miles total range using its 100kWh NMC battery.
The DC 150kW Fast Charging system gets you an 80 percent charge in under 30 minutes, according to Karma Automotive. Household current levels of charging at 11kW will give the GTE a full charge overnight.
Manufacturing & Availability
The Revero GTE, like other Karma models, will be assembled at Karma’s Innovation and Customization Center in Moreno Valley, California. The car was developed, styled, and engineered at the company’s headquarters in Irvine.
Karma Automotive will have a pre-order system up and running in the coming months, with Revero GTEs showing up in dealerships by spring of 2021. Later in the fall of 2021, Karma Automotive plans to release the Revero GTE in China and Europe.

2020/04/17,First GM-Ventec Ventilators Delivered to Chicago Hospitals,"CHICAGO – The first VOCSN V+Pro critical care ventilators produced by General Motors and Ventec Life Systems in Kokomo, Indiana are being delivered by UPS to Franciscan Health Olympia Fields in Olympia Fields, Illinois and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago at the direction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The milestone shipments are putting important tools in the hands of frontline medical professionals treating patients seriously ill with COVID-19.
“The passion and commitment that people at GM, Ventec, and our suppliers have put into this work is inspiring,” said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. “We are all humbled to support the heroic efforts of medical professionals in Chicagoland and across the world who are fighting to save lives and turn the tide of the pandemic.”
“Patients deserve access to the best technology to keep them in the fight as their bodies combat the virus,” added Ventec Life Systems CEO Chris Kiple. “Critical care ventilators deliver precise airflow to protect the lungs, include accurate monitors to assess patient well-being, and most importantly, they include advanced controls that help respiratory therapists and physicians wean patients off ventilators as fast as possible.”
Critical Shipments
Franciscan Health Olympia Fields received their shipment early Friday morning and Weiss Memorial will receive theirs Friday afternoon. A third shipment from GM-Kokomo will be delivered by UPS to FEMA at the Gary/Chicago International Airport on Saturday for distribution to other locations where the need is greatest.
“UPS always stands ready to meet the urgent needs of the American people, and we are proud to be selected to make this historic delivery,” explained UPS Chairman and CEO David Abney. “This monumental effort is a testament to the unbridled ingenuity and innovation of American companies. In the words of our founder, determined people working together can accomplish anything; and GM, Ventec and UPS have accomplished this together with the speed, quality and exacting precision that the world expects from America’s private sector.”

Ongoing Effort
The deliveries are the culmination of a partnership between GM and Ventec Life Systems that began with a phone call exactly one month ago. Since then, the combined teams have sourced thousands of parts, transformed GM’s advanced electronics facility in Kokomo for medical device production, and contracted with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide 30,000 ventilators by the end of August.
More than 1,000 men and women from the Kokomo community will be building ventilators.
“For a community hospital that was already struggling with budgetary constraints prior to this crisis, these ventilators are a much-needed infusion of critical resources to care for our patients, which includes a significant elderly population,” said Mary Shehan, CEO of Weiss Memorial Hospital. “We are extremely grateful for the support and to all those who are rallying to ensure that our frontline caregivers have the necessary supplies to care for our patients. We need all the help we can get now to rise to this unprecedented challenge.”
“We have healthcare heroes who are on the front lines in this pandemic and we’re grateful to know there is support to attain more of the essential resources they need to care for the most critically ill patients,” added Allan M. Spooner, President and CEO of Franciscan Health Olympia Fields. “Every single one of these ventilators will make a difference in the lives of critical COVID-19 patients and our other patients with acute respiratory illness. We are grateful and inspired by the ingenuity and dedication of everyone behind this truly lifesaving gift.”

TORQUE
1,254 lb-ft.
WEIGHT
1,680 kg (3,703 lbs.)
PRICE
$1.9 Million
NUMBER THAT WILL BE MADE
130
The Lotus Evija is the automaker’s first electric vehicle, and like any Lotus, it’s pretty much a technical marvel. The Evija’s power output of 2,000 PS makes it the world’s – drum roll please – most powerful production road car! Although we think somebody (and there will be somebody!) will try and top that before long (Bugatti, Pininfarina, Ultima etc.), the Evija is the king of the mountain for now.
With the Lotus Evija, it’s customization that’s king. When you’re at this level, offering bespoke treatments is the icing on the cake. The Evija is one frosty cake for sure, and no two customers are cutting the same slice. Lotus says personalization requests are coming in for every aspect of the car.
“We know every customer journey will be unique and our highly experienced customer relations team is ready to support any requests,” explained Simon Clare, Executive Director, Global Marketing, Lotus.
What Is The Lotus Evija Configurator?
The touch-screen configurator uses gaming software and powerful graphics processors to create “photo-realistic” images and animations of the Evija. In so many words, customers can build their dream Evija from the ground up. However, Lotus uses an advanced imaging technique known as ray-tracing, which takes this far beyond any normal car configuration tool. Buyers can actually take their Evija and drop it into multiple environments around the world to see how sunlight in their area will affect the look of the car.
This is, admittedly, hard to do in Michigan where it rains in the morning, is bright and sunny in the afternoon, snows at night, with thunderstorms in the overnight just for good measure. But you get the idea.
“With state-of-the-art digital tools such as the new configurator, we can accommodate customer preferences and requirements from anywhere in the world at the touch of a button,” Clare said.

Where Is This Cool Lotus Evija Configurator?
Unfortunately, it’s not something we can play with online. You only receive a configurator from Lotus if you reserved an Evija. Thus, you can’t waste time dinking around on the Lotus Evija Configurator when you should be working (but I totally would).
Related: The story behind the design of the Lotus Evija.
Regardless, the company released a series of photos showing how customers are configuring their cars. A gallery and a video are below. They reveal a car inside the Lotus Design studios in Hethel, UK. The ones in the gallery are finished in Atomic Red with a Carbon Black accent pack. The video shows this Evija, along with two others: one in Solaris Yellow and the other in Carbon Black.
Lotus Evija Availability
Production of the Lotus Evija will begin later this year, with the first allocation already designated to customers. Lotus is only building 130 examples, with a retail price right around two million. At the time of delivery, customers will receive a hand-crafted book with images of their individual car during key moments of its assembly.
Talk about something cool to put in your office!

2020/04/15,"Ford, Wayne State, ACCESS Launch Mobile COVID-19 Testing For Michigan First Responders","DEARBORN, Mich., April 15, 2020 – Ford Motor Company, Wayne State University, the Wayne State University Physician Group, and ACCESS are launching a new initiative to improve access to COVID-19 testing for symptomatic first responders, health care workers, and corrections officers in Michigan.
Ford is providing vehicles, drivers, and equipment to help create the first mobile testing service in Michigan.
The effort is an extension of drive-through testing sites that opened in Detroit and Dearborn on March 20 with financial backing from Wayne State University’s Office of the President. To date, 3,300 police officers, firefighters, and health care professionals have been tested at those sites by WSU and ACCESS health care professionals and volunteers.
Vehicles Equipped For COVID-19 Testing
Ford’s in-house incubator, Ford X, is providing Lincoln Navigators and drivers from the Lincoln Personal Driver pilot service, and is equipping them with tents, sanitation, power and Wi-Fi to support mobile testing. Each vehicle will be fully equipped for mobile COVID-19 testing with staff and medical kits provided by WSU and ACCESS.
“This support for those on the front lines of the pandemic is critical, and we felt we needed to respond urgently by testing first responders and health care workers with drive-through testing,” said WSU President M. Roy Wilson. “Now we can expand our efforts with ‘drive-to’ testing for those first responders across the region who lack access to testing.”
Each Navigator is fully-equipped for mobile COVID-19 testing and can accommodate as many as 100 people a day, with test results returned within 24 to 36 hours. The mobile testing program launched April 13.
“We are extremely grateful to Ford for helping us expand this initiative and bring mobile testing to these high-risk individuals, and to the United Way for its support of both our drive-through and drive-to initiatives,” Wilson continued.
“We believe this work with Wayne State and their coalition to improve access to testing for Michigan first responders is a meaningful opportunity to use our mobility knowledge and resources to help our community during this pandemic,” added Kristin Welch, Manager, Strategy & Operations, Ford X.

Where & How Testing Will Take Place In Michigan
Testing will begin in southeast Michigan, and is expected to encompass other regions of the state, including Battle Creek, Lansing, and Grand Rapids. Testing will take place as long as the virus continues to impact communities. Clinicians and professionals from WSU and ACCESS will provide free testing that does not require a prescription from a physician.
“As a community nonprofit with longtime partnerships with both Ford and Wayne State, we are pleased to expand this critical collaboration,” said Lina Hourani-Harajli, Chief Operating Officer of ACCESS. “When we look back at this defining moment in history, it is truly gratifying to see how many incredible institutions have stepped up to be a small part of helping our frontline heroes fight against this pandemic.”
“This work is in addition to that being done by our colleagues throughout the company to help produce and distribute critical medical equipment, including face masks and ventilators to support those that are caring for, and protecting others during these uncertain times,” Welch added.
Ford has already produced more than three million face shields in Plymouth, Michigan, while ventilator production is ongoing. Ford is also making face masks and leading an effort to scale production of reusable gowns with more the 5,000 already supplied to Beaumont Health in metro Detroit.
Who To Contact & Where To Donate
Agencies wanting to host a test site can call 313-269-1952.
Or by email: Mseredynski@accesscommunity.org.
In addition, Wayne State has established the Warrior Relief and Response campaign to provide support for critical programs and services. Gifts in support of COVID-19 mobile testing will help increase access to much needed screening and testing within the metro Detroit area.

2020/04/15,Lamborghini Supporting Siare In The Production of Breathing Simulators,"Sant’Agata Bolognese, 15 April 2020 – Automobili Lamborghini is providing resources and equipment from its Research and Development Department for the co-engineering and production of breathing simulators, supporting Siare Engineering International Group, Italy’s top manufacturer of ventilators, during the health emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19.
The breathing simulator enables the tester to carry out an initial evaluation of the ventilator’s performance before reaching the final checking stage, when the ventilator undergoes a comprehensive test using certified equipment.
Lamborghini has used its 3D printing laboratory to design, produce and validate the simulator, optimizing the components and enabling the production of 18 simulators per week, alongside the 3D-printed production of polycarbonate medical visors. Lamborghini is currently using an HP Jet Fusion 3D 4200 printer with MJF technology, capable of printing with a 0.08 mm precision level.
Recently, Lamborghini converted parts of their plant in Sant’Agata Bolognese for the production of surgical masks and protective plexiglass shields.

2020/04/14,First GM-Ventec V+Pro Ventilators Ready for Delivery,"KOKOMO, Ind. – General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) has begun mass production of the Ventec Life Systems V+Pro critical care ventilator under contract to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“Thousands of men and women at GM, Ventec, our suppliers and the Kokomo community have rallied to support their neighbors and the medical professionals on the front lines of this pandemic,” said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. “Everyone wants to help turn the tide and save lives.”
Teamwork Amid The Pandemic
In less than a month, Ventec, GM’s supply chain and its manufacturing, logistics, legal, and talent acquisition teams were able to marshal support to deliver a 30,000-unit order from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
“Until there is a vaccine, critical care ventilators give medical professionals the tools they need to fight this pandemic and save lives,” said Ventec Life Systems CEO Chris Kiple. “This partnership is an historic effort and a great reminder of what can be accomplished with the power of American innovation and American manufacturing skill uniting together around a singular mission to save lives.”
“It is inspiring and humbling to see the passion and commitment people have put into this work,” Barra added.
The effort involved sourcing hundreds of parts and assemblies from suppliers; the design of a new manufacturing process; the transformation of GM’s Kokomo factory; the ongoing hiring of more than 1,000 manufacturing team members; and the implementation of extensive health and safety protocols in the workplace.

Ongoing Support
Throughout the effort, GM had strong support from the leadership of the United Auto Workers, including the UAW-GM Department and UAW Local 292, community groups and elected officials in Kokomo, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy.
More than 600 ventilators will be shipped this month, almost half the order will be filled by the end of June and the full order will be completed by the end of August. GM has the capacity to build more ventilators after August if needed.
Timeline of Events
GM and Ventec executives had their first conference calls on Tuesday, March 17 and Wednesday, March 18 to explore how GM could help Ventec increase ventilator production.
The next day, a GM team flew to Seattle to meet with the Ventec team and rolled up their sleeves to help.
On Friday, March 20, GM engaged its global supply base and within 72 hours, they had developed plans to source 100 percent of the necessary parts.
The UAW’s national and local leadership embraced the project and on Wednesday, March 25, crews began preparing the Kokomo site for production.
On Wednesday, April 8, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded GM a contract under the Defense Production Act to build 30,000 Ventec V+Pro critical care ventilators.

2020/04/09,GM Shares Face Mask Production Blueprint With Other Suppliers,"More information on the design of the face mask can be found through the Michigan Manufacturers Association. You can also request a free blue print of the face mask.
DETROIT – Based on the overwhelming number of requests for face masks for frontline workers, GM is increasing its production capacity for face masks at its Warren, Michigan facility. In addition, the company has shared its manufacturing plans with GM suppliers along with the Original Equipment Suppliers Association and the Michigan Manufacturers Association to help other manufacturers ramp up their own production efforts.
“Our ultimate goal is to get more masks to the people who desperately need them,” said Shilpan Amin, GM vice president of Global Purchasing and Supply Chain. “And we recognize it would be counterproductive for GM – or any other manufacturer – to compete for supplies with existing medical mask companies. By making GM’s production processes available to the OESA and the MMA, we hope to facilitate other companies’ efforts to bring more materials, more equipment and ultimately, more face masks to the community.”
“The Michigan Manufacturers Association has 1,700 companies across all industries, and many are looking for ways to help during this crisis,” said John Walsh, Michigan Manufacturers Association president and CEO. “GM’s production plans and their willingness to share design specifications will be extremely appreciated as our members accelerate their own efforts to help during this crisis. GM’s efforts are a strong symbol of how manufacturing is driving solutions to solve this crisis.”
“The 500+ members of OESA are honored to lend their manufacturing expertise in this initiative,” said Julie A. Fream, OESA president and CEO. “For automotive suppliers, this is an excellent opportunity to champion the efforts of our healthcare workers and provide much needed PPE to help fight the global coronavirus pandemic.”
Ongoing Initiative
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, GM is currently producing face masks Warren and in China through a joint venture with SAIC-GM-Wuling. Studies are underway to launch similar initiatives in other countries.
The Warren facility can now produce up to 1.5 million face masks a month. Coordinating with the State of Michigan’s Michigan Community Service Commission, GM’s site in Warren has already delivered face masks to local hospitals. Over the weekend, the site will add two additional production lines: a second line for face masks and a new line for filtering facepiece respirators.
For U.S. production, the company partnered with existing automotive suppliers to provide the materials and equipment necessary for mask production.
JR Automation in Holland, Michigan and Esys Automation in Auburn Hills typically provide GM with automotive-manufacturing equipment. For GM’s face-mask production, the company built a mask line that automatically folds, welds, and cuts face masks.
GDC in Goshen, Indiana provides GM with sound-deadening insulation found in vehicle doors, headliners and trunks. To transition to making materials for GM’s face mask production, GDC enlisted the help of OXCO in Fort Mill, South Carolina. Both companies’ employees worked around the clock and over weekends to alter their production processes for the manufacturing of three layers of fabric used to manufacture masks.

2020/04/08,Polestar Precept: Science Fiction or Something More?,"Polestar is, essentially, what Volvos will become in the future. At the moment, Polestar is a brand unto themselves, but it is obvious this is where the Swedish auto manufacturer is heading. With the Polestar Precept, we are seeing the company’s future in three key areas: sustainability, digital technology, and design as it relates to the modern automobile.
What Is The Polestar Precept?
The name Precept tells you all you need to know. A precept is sign of things to come, a declaration, an assertion. Polestar says the name reflects the car’s role in defining their aim as a contemporary electric performance brand.
“People ask me all the time, ‘what is the future of Polestar,’ and of course we are not showing our future models just yet,” said Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. “But Precept shows you where we will be heading – our design direction, our ambitions about sustainability and the great digital user experience we will bring with those future cars.”
The Polestar Precept is meant to convey three key areas for the automaker: sustainability, digital technology, and design. Photo: Polestar.
Polestar Precept: Sustainable Materials
The interior uses a number of sustainable materials to create what will become Polestar’s luxury design language. Polestar describes the interior as “vegan” with high levels of recycled content, which the company started doing already with the Polestar 2. The Precept goes further, however, integrating a flax-based natural composite to replace plastic content by 80 percent. According to Polestar, this also cuts interior weight by half.
The materials use a proprietary technology from supplier Bcomp called powerRibs, which are inspired by leaf veins. Bcomp also supplies ampliTex composite materials to reduce vibrations for occupants. The seat covers and headliner are 3D-knitted from recycled water bottles in a single thread, made exactly to size with no waste or off-cuts, which is very cool.
The carpets are woven from Nylon 6 ECONYL, recovered from reclaimed fishing nets. Waste and recycled cork from the wine industry is also converted into cork-based vinyl for seat bolsters and head rests.
Batteries for the EV powertrain are beneath the floor as to not intrude on passenger space. Photo: Polestar.
Digital Technology & Connectivity
The Precept builds upon the Android-powered infotainment system in the Polestar 2. There’s a 15-inch digital interface that recognizes you as you walk up, and adjusts the settings and personal content accordingly (authenticated via Polestar Digital Key). Google Assistant is offered in multiple languages and video streaming services are available when you’re parked or charging. The touchscreen uses proximity sensors depending on where your hand is placed, and adjusts brightness and content according to what you are doing.
There is also a nine-inch horizontal driver display with “eye-tracking” technology. These eye-tracking monitors follow where you are looking, adjusting the way information is presented: from smaller and more detailed when you are focused on the display, to larger and brighter, when looking at the road.
Photo: Polestar.
Polestar Precept: Styling & Design
Polestar wants the Precept’s design to create a new aesthetic for the oncoming “electric age.” Or rather, the Polestar Precept is very Scandinavian, very clean, and very forward-looking in its design. And much of the design is focused on aerodynamic performance.
A good example is the front fender, now integrated into the hood to improve air flow over the body. There are air ducts behind the front wheels for better ventilation, while additional ducts at the rear help cool the brakes. There are also aerodynamic inserts for the 22-inch wheels.
In lieu of a traditional front grille, the Precept uses something dubbed as SmartZone, which hints at the car’s autonomous – or at least semi autonomous – capabilities. Polestar’s Pilot Assist system includes long- and mid-range radar units, ultrasonic sensors, and a high-definition wide-angle camera. There is a roof-mounted LIDAR pod and additional sensors on both sides of the car for other driving assistance features.
“Precept showcases our future, not as a fancy dream or something out of a sci-fi movie,” Ingenlath said. “This is our reality to come.”
Pay attention to what you see here in the Polestar Precept. We will see more cars like it coming down the road in the future.

2020/04/07,Nissan Ariya Concept Ditches Tablet Display for Something More Intuitive,"Touchscreens and tablet-sized displays are everywhere in the car world these days, from the highest-tech Teslas to entry-level autos manufactured in emerging world markets. It makes sense, since everyone seems to be carrying a screen or two or three around with them. But what if a car maker went a different way? Is that possible?
Say hello to the Nissan Ariya Concept, the EV crossover that aims to think differently about how drivers get their information.
What Is The Nissan Ariya Concept?
Nissan unveiled the all-wheel drive electric crossover in October at the Tokyo Motor Show. In a lot of ways, you wouldn’t give the Nissan Ariya a second glance. It looks like the Kicks, Nissan’s small SUV, from a few years in the future. Besides that, everything else is pretty futuristic, as you would expect for a concept car. It has an electric drivetrain, a sleek interior design, super fancy wheels, and semi-autonomous capabiliteis, but it’s the dashboard Nissan is particularly proud of.
With the Ariya Concept, Nissan doesn’t follow the current trend of nailing a huge plasma screen TV to your dash. Instead, the Ariya Concept has a curved, two-screen display Nissan says is “reminiscent of a wave.” They also say the design gives the interior a sense of “horizon,” from elements in the door all the way to the rear of the cabin.
And that last part seems logical, when you think about it.

The Horizontal View
Your eyes are side by side, not one on top of the other. We see from side to side, which is why computer screens, movie theaters, and TVs are formatted horizontally. And this is why no one should shoot iPhone videos vertically! So Nissan figures not only matching the cabin’s “horizon aesthetic” is a good thing, but going horizontal also conveys information better for the human eye.
The display keeps the important info on the instrument cluster right over the steering wheel, which is traditional, and also smart from an ergonomics standpoint. Entertainment functions, comfort controls, and system status updates are located in the center screen. Both displays are wrapped in one sleek panel that flows seamlessly between driver and passenger. It looks good (as concept cars do) but it’s functional (as concept cars seemingly never are).
Photo: Nissan North America.
Configurable & Flexible Display
The user experience is configurable at a very granular level. Drivers can adjust how much data is shown on each part of the screen, from navigation to music, while removing unnecessary information from their periphery. Information can move or be swiped between the two screens to create the feeling of a single, integrated display, Nissan says.
If you want your route directions and the map in front of the steering wheel, there they are. If you want to move them to the center, say if your co-pilot is doing the navigating, you can. Or they can disappear entirely when no longer needed. It’s up to you as the driver.

A Work In Progress
The display in the Nissan Ariya Concept looks sleek, seamless and natural, but it didn’t start that way. Nissan’s first iteration of the display was a large black “box” they named “the Monolith,” a nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey. They chipped away, figuratively speaking, at the housing until it became what’s seen here in the final concept car.
By the time the Ariya makes it to production, the display screens should be easy and artful enough to use, even your average caveman could do it.

2020/04/03,"Audi RS 3 Nardo Edition: Quick, Cool & Available (But Limited!)","The 2020 Audi RS 3 Nardo Edition is quick, cool, and available! Well, kinda available that is. Only 200 units will be produced for the U.S. market. While we imagine Nardo is a reference to the town in southern Italy, this special RS 3 is only for true blue enthusiasts.
“The standard RS fixed sport suspension allows for increased agility and enhanced cornering capabilities on and off the track,” reads a statement from Audi about the RS 3 Nardo Edition. “Building on the success of this model, RS 3 Nardo Edition delivers maximum performance for true automotive enthusiasts with a passion for driving.”
Audi RS 3 Nardo Edition: Styling & Design
We like the Nardo Gray paint and the Black Optic exterior trim. Both are contrasted nicely by the 19-inch wheels, red brake calipers, and oval exhaust outlets at the rear. The Singleframe grille with “quattro” script highlights, and the black Audi rings and badges are befitting for the RS 3 Nardo Edition.

Interior Treatments: Tech & Crescendo Red
Inside, drivers will find Audi’s virtual cockpit, MMI Navigation plus, and MMI touch with handwriting-recognition technology.

2020/04/03,2021 Hyundai Elantra: When a Compact Sedan Grows Up,"Just when we thought conventional four-door sedans were afterthoughts, along comes the 2021 Hyundai Elantra. From the onset, the Elantra is a bigger, sleeker, and wider car, which is great if you want to lead the supersized compact segment dominated by the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. I have an inkling for Elantras in general. I’ve driven lots of Elantras over the years, although I never had the chance of owning one.
And the introduction of the 2021 Hyundai Elantra makes me think I was missing out.
Elantras & Lancers: Setting The Stage
I’ve had the privilege of owning a bevy of Japanese cars, most particularly Mitsubishi sedans and coupes from the previous millennia. The Elantra started its life using a pair of Mitsubishi-designed 4G15 DOHC 1.5-liter and 4G61 1.6-liter DOHC engines. Back in the day, Hyundai Automotive was in its early stages of development, which meant the company had to rely on existing platforms and powertrains to kickstart a new generation of automobiles.
The first-generation J1 Elantra, on the market from 1990 to 1995, is mechanically related to the Mitsubishi Lancer (or Mirage in some parts of the world). And you know what, Mitsubishi was the bomb in the early and late 90s. You’ve heard of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution series? You see, the Evolution I (yes, the very first Lancer Evo) was born in 1992 and was based on the current-generation Lancer at that time. The original Evo rally car was based on the 1987 Galant VR-4, but Mitsubishi shifted to the Lancer as rally cars were becoming smaller to conquer tighter courses.
Since Elantras are Lancers in disguise, the former inherited the famed sharp and agile handling of the latter. Granted, Lancers were not as comfy as Corollas or Sentras from previous eras, but they sure were the sportiest and best-handling of the bunch. I’ve owned a Sentra, two Lancers, and a Galant from roughly the same eras (the eighth-gen Galant is the best-handling Japanese sedan I’ve ever driven, hands down).

2021 Hyundai Elantra: Looking The Part
Now that the new Elantra is here (and both the Lancer and Galant were discontinued), it made me reconsider my previous thoughts. Back then, if you were already behind the wheel of the original car, why bother with a clone? Everything changed when Hyundai came up with its Alpha and Beta series of engines for the second-gen J2 Elantra. Since then, Hyundai slowly began etching its own identity, but the Mitsubishi DNA was still there.
The outgoing sixth-gen Elantra is, without a doubt, the best-looking Elantra, and I’ve driven it many times. Dare I say it was more refined than any Mitsubishi Lancer, including the last ninth-gen model.  Also, I’m not sure if it’s a wise idea to bless the seventh-generation Elantra with the new Sonata’s daring silhouette. But the more I look, the more I’m convinced it works.
What’s not hard to notice is the Elantra’s bigger body. It’s longer (2.2 inches) and wider (one inch) than the outgoing Elantra, and it’s also riding on a longer 107.1-inch wheelbase. The new Elantra is longer and wider than both the Corolla and Civic. It even has the longest wheelbase among the current crop of compacts save for the new Mazda3. In short, the Hyundai Elantra is all grown up.
“We’ve sold more than 3.4 million Elantras here in the U.S. and more than 13.8 million worldwide,” said José Muñoz, President and CEO, Hyundai Motor America. “And the new, captivating look is going to bring excitement to a whole new generation of buyers.”
Hyundai says the grille of the 2021 Elantra has a “parametric-jewel-pattern.” Photo: Hyundai Motor America.
“Parametric Dynamic” Styling
Hyundai refers to the new Elantra’s styling as a “Parametric Dynamic” design, but allow me to translate: The 2021 Hyundai Elantra is a four-door sedan with a coupe-like slanting roofline. It also happens to look similar to the new Sonata at times. Viewed from the sides, however, the new Elantra can look like a smaller Honda Accord (I swear it’s because of the sloping roof design).
And this is probably up for debate, but the strong fascia is a love-it or hate-it moment upon first glance.
Calling it “bold” is an understatement, but the wider and cascading grille design along with a pair of scowling headlights are enough to revolutionize the Elantra’s façade. Combined with strong creases on the hood and sharper body lines, the 2021 Elantra is either eye-catching or polarizing depending on your tastes, but the expressive styling is a welcome change.
“The fresh esthetic was completed through unconventional lines and a face that broke a taboo in automotive design,” said Luc Donckerwolke, Executive Vice President and Chief Design Officer of the Hyundai Motor Group. “Like the first generation, the seventh-generation Elantra has a bold character.”
The rear is highlighted by a wide horizontal line extending across the center of the trunk, which stretches to the edges of the vehicle. From the back angle, the new Elantra gives the impression of a proper coupe, which is nice.

Roomier Interior? You Bet!
Along with a bigger body is a bigger cabin, and the Elantra gladly obliges. With 40.6 inches of front headroom and 37.3 inches in the rear, it bests the Civic, Mazda3 sedan, Nissan Sentra, and Toyota Corolla despite having a lower roof and coupe-like profile. The longer wheelbase and marginally longer rear overhang also mean loads of rear legroom and trunk space. The new Elantra has the most rear legroom (38.0 inches) among all compact cars. It also has a bigger trunk (14.2 cubic feet) than a Corolla or Mazda 3.
The all-new interior design is worthy of praise. Higher trim models receive a pair of 10.3-inch displays similar to the Mercedes-Benz MBUX system. You’ll also find slim air vents and a bevy of soft-touch materials – including a large grab handle for the passenger to hang on to. Is this a sign of things to come, namely a high-performance Elantra N-model?

2021 Hyundai Elantra: Gas & Hybrid Options
The Elantra SE, SEL, and Limited are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder MPI Atkinson Cycle engine. This motor is good for 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft. of torque, and is paired with a CVT transmission to achieve the highest possible fuel economy. Hyundai calls it an IVT or Intelligent Variable Transmission. It has a chain-design instead of conventional push belts. According to Hyundai, this new gearbox improves low-speed acceleration and fuel economy.
Meanwhile, the 2021 Elantra Hybrid has a smaller 1.6-liter four-banger paired with an electric motor. The combined system output is 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft. of torque. The hybrid model makes good use of a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. It also has a sportier multi-link rear suspension than gasoline-only models.
“While some manufacturers no longer see the value in the car side of the business, we’re doubling down by offering an all-new model with both gas and hybrid powertrains,” Muñoz said of the 2021 Hyundai Elantra.
Hyundai has yet to release the official fuel economy numbers for both engines, but the Elantra Hybrid is expected to breach the 50 mpg barrier in the combined cycle.

Fantastic New-Age Tech
Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, even without the optional 10.25-inch display screens. The cabin is also governed by an on-board voice recognition system, accessed via the “push to talk button” on the steering wheel. You can use the feature to adjust a number of fan and climate settings, including turning on the heated seats.
Hyundai’s Blue Link Connected Car System for the Elantra uses embedded telematics. Drivers can remote-start their vehicle and control interior temperatures using the MyHyundai smartphone app. Via the Blue Link voice controls, you can ask your Elantra to find the nearest burger or coffee joint, or retrieve the scores from last night’s Red Wing’s game.
Also, the 2021 Hyundai Elantra is equipped with mood lighting with 64 colors to choose from. Why anyone would need 64 colors is beyond us, but there you go.
2021 Hyundai Elantra: Safety Features
Standard safety features for the 2021 Hyundai Elantra include lane-keeping assist; automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection; automatic high beams; lane-following assist; and a driver attention warning system that chimes in if it senses the driver is tired, fatigued, or dozing off. These are part of the SmartSense package.
Optional features for the SmartSense package include blind-spot detection and collision avoidance; smart cruise control; Highway Driving Assist; Safe Exit Warning; and reverse collision avoidance. In terms of the 2021 Elantra’s architecture and chassis, Hyundai says the new platform improves safety by way of a multi-load path structure.

2020/04/02,Toyota Camry & Avalon AWD: Nice Option But Do You Need It?,"Toyota Camry and Avalon now have all-wheel drive as a standalone option.
Different components from the RAV4 and Highlander were used for the sedans.
Although a nice option, all-wheel drive may not be necessary for some buyers.
Toyota’s research team in Saline, Michigan came back from the drawing board with an all-wheel drive option for the 2020 Camry and 2021 Avalon. With more room in the market as players like Ford and GM exit, Toyota is making a seemingly simple but crucial addition here with all-wheel drive. In short, both cars will be more capable in snowy weather, but if you are a longtime Camry or Avalon buyer, is all-wheel drive worth it?    
How Does All-Wheel Drive Change Things?
According to Toyota, buyers will notice little, if any, change between the front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive Camry and Avalon. Toyota’s New Global Architecture (TNGA) allows the all-wheel drive models to retain the same suspension tuning, wheels, and tires as the front-wheel drive versions. In other words, you might only notice all-wheel drive in slippery or snowy conditions (if that, since most systems on the market today are fairly seamless).
Otherwise, for all intents and purposes, Toyota claims the cars ride like their front-wheel drive cousins. 
Blending Two Vehicles Together
Since TNGA is a flexible platform for Toyota, engineers had the freedom to incorporate the components necessary for the all-wheel drive Camry and Avalon. When Toyota started planning for the addition, they looked at the RAV4 as an eligible bachelor since it is also based on the TNGA platform. It may feel like an unconventional pairing, but Toyota seems to believe this true love encounter will produce the ruggedness of an SUV in an affordable sedan.  
Toyota took the upper body structure of the Camry and Avalon and combined it with the RAV4’s multi-link rear suspension. From there, the RAV4’s suspension was adapted with specific modifications and tuning to suit the sedans. The RAV4 wasn’t the only SUV on Toyota’s radar either. They put a modified version of the Highlander’s propeller shaft in both the all-wheel drive Camry and Avalon.

Engine & Powertrain  
Both the all-wheel drive Toyota Camry and Avalon have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with a dual overhead cam. The engine, complete with an aluminum alloy block and aluminum alloy heads, is paired to an eight-speed automatic. The Camry delivers 202 horsepower which is more than enough for your daily routine. The Camry XSE and Avalon bump things up a little bit with 205 horsepower and dual exhaust. 
Related: Everything you need to know about a Toyota Warranty.
How Does AWD Work In The Camry & Avalon? 
Up to 50 percent of the engine’s torque can be directed to the rear wheels by the electromagnetic controlled coupling. This coupling engages and disengages the propeller shaft from the differential depending on if the situation demands all-wheel drive. During acceleration and slippage at the front wheels, all-wheel drive will kick in to distribute power more effectively, but then disconnect during long highway stretches or casual cruising to conserve fuel.

What Is The Fuel Economy?
EPA-ratings for the all-wheel drive Toyota Camry LE and SE are 25/34 city/highway and 29 combined; whereas the XLE and XSE return the same city/highway numbers, but one mpg less combined at 28.
A quick look at the Carmy shows it is a bit behind its all-wheel drive competitors like the Nissan Altima and Subaru legacy. Both the Legacy and Altima with all-wheel drive have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, the same displacement as the all-wheel drive Camry. The 2020 Altima gets an estimated 26/36 city/highway and 30 combined. By comparison, the 2020 Legacy comes in at 27/35 city/highway and 30 combined.
Standard Safety Features
All 2020 Toyota Camry and Avalon models are standard with Toyota Safety Sense-P (often written as TSS-P). The package includes:
Automatic High Beams.
Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.
Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist.
Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection.
Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross Traffic Alert is available for the Camry, but standard on Avalon. Intelligent Clearance Sonar with Rear Cross Traffic Braking is available for both cars.

Should I Buy My Camry or Avalon With AWD?
We know well in Michigan how desirable all-wheel drive sounds, especially when the forecast is predicting one winter storm after another. Drivers often gravitate toward trucks and SUVs for reasons like this. There is, after all, an added sense of security a 4×4 vehicle can provide.  
But if you are more at ease driving a car, a Camry or Avalon with all-wheel drive might be a better option. Versus a “normal” front-whee drive sedan, you will have more traction during snowy and icy conditions without having to make the switch to an SUV or a truck. If you live someplace where it doesn’t – or rarely ever – snows, then you probably don’t need all-wheel drive.
If you are on a shoestring budget like me, the front-wheel drive Camry is more attractive. The front-wheel drive version has the same 2.5-liter four-cylinder, and with some gasoline versions pushing 40 highway mpg, it’s just more affordable in the long run. Those with extended work commutes will benefit the most from the front-wheel drive Camry, as will weekend road-trippers.

Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Toyota Camry is available now, with all-wheel drive as an option on four trim levels: LE, SE, XLE, and the sportier XSE. The all-wheel drive LE starts at $26,370, while the XSE begins at $31,405. The all-wheel Avalon arrives this fall as a 2021 model year. Pricing and fuel economy figures will be announced closer to that time.
Both the all-wheel drive Camry and Avalon are only available in North America, and are assembled at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky.

2020/03/31,GM to Make Face Masks for Frontline Workers,"DETROIT – As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the country, it created a critical shortage of face masks. To help protect workers in essential services across the country, GM launched a rapid-response project to produce masks at scale on Friday, March 20. Seven days later, the team had produced their first sample on the new production line.
By next week, GM expects to deliver its first 20,000 masks to frontline workers.
Without help from GM’s partners around the globe, the project would have taken several months to plan and execute. The team working on GM’s face-mask project accomplished the task in just one week.
“Our team began looking at ways we could quickly utilize our talents and resources to help in the shared fight against COVID-19,” said Peter Thom, GM vice president, Global Manufacturing Engineering. “Working around the clock, our team rallied with incredible passion and focus to come up with a plan to produce masks that will help protect the women and men on the front lines of this crisis.”
Setting The Timeline
At 3 p.m. on Friday, March 20, the core team assembled for the first time, kicking off the project and starting the timer.
“Because we wanted to move fast, the team set an incredibly aggressive goal: To have the production line up and running tests within a week,” said Thom.
More than 30 engineers, designers, buyers and members of the manufacturing team were asked to help with product development, sourcing materials and equipment, and planning the production process.
“The first people we called were those who work with fabric vehicle components,” said Karsten Garbe, GM plant director, Global Pre-Production Operations. “In a few days, the company’s seat belt and interior trim experts became experts in manufacturing face masks.”

Leveraging The Supply Chain
The team sourced the necessary raw materials by leveraging GM’s existing supply chain. These materials include metal nose pieces, elastic straps and blown, non-woven fabric filter material. Simultaneously, GM collaborated with JR Automation in Holland, Michigan and Esys Automation in Auburn Hills to design and build the custom machinery needed to assemble the masks.
For the project, the team selected the ISO Class 8-equivalent cleanroom at GM’s manufacturing plant in Warren. Work began at the Warren facility by removing existing equipment from the cleanroom. The team cleared approximately 31,000 square feet to accommodate the mask production lines. Crews then installed new electrical service lines to power the production equipment and assembly stations.
With the site cleared and prepped, production equipment and materials were then delivered to the Warren facility. Crews worked around the clock to install equipment and stage the production line. The team then tested each step in the production process, looking for opportunities to improve quality and production speed.
At 2:30 p.m. on Friday, March 27, the project team had their first production-made mask in their hands.
“Not only did the team make their goal, but they over-delivered,” said Thom. “They actually beat our deadline, running the first mask through the equipment 30 minutes ahead of target. We’re excited because this means we’re even closer to being able to protect the healthcare teams who are working tirelessly to save lives.”

20,000 Masks by April 8th
The projected production volume is just as aggressive as the project’s timeline. By Monday, March 30, more than 2,000 masks were produced by teams working through the weekend. These initial test samples will be used to ensure the quality standards are met. Once these quality measures are completed, the team expects to start producing masks for delivery early next week.
GM and the UAW will seek more than two dozen paid volunteers from Detroit-area plants to staff mask operations. In addition, GM has implemented a series of safety measures to protect these team members through physical distancing, enhanced on-site cleaning and pre-entry health screening.
The team expects to have 20,000 masks ready for delivery on Wednesday, April 8. Once the line is running at full speed, it will be able to produce up to 50,000 masks every day – or up to 1.5 million masks a month. GM is currently developing a plan for distributing the masks, including using some of this important safety equipment to protect employees in critical GM operations.

Rawsonville Plant Will Produce Ventilators
Ford will initially send a team to work with Airon to boost production in Florida, and by the week of April 20, will start production at Ford’s Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., quickly ramping up to reach full production to help meet surging demand.
Ford expects to produce 1,500 by the end of April, 12,000 by the end of May and 50,000 by July 4 – helping the U.S. government meet its goal of producing 100,000 ventilators in 100 days.
Ford’s Rawsonville plant will produce the ventilators nearly around the clock, with 500 paid volunteer UAW-represented employees working on three shifts. Airon currently produces three Airon pNeuton Model A ventilators per day in Melbourne, Fla. At full production, Ford plans to make 7,200 Airon-licensed Model A-E ventilators per week.
“From the days of Rosie the Riveter, UAW members have stepped up during difficult times in this nation’s history for the good of us all,” said UAW International President Rory Gamble. “Today’s announcement by Ford that UAW employees will make ventilators at Rawsonville is in that tradition. We are working very closely with Ford to make sure that all CDC guidelines are followed and that we are exercising an abundance of caution inside the plant. Ford and our UAW Ford members should be commended for stepping up in these very uncertain times.”

Ongoing Effort
The Airon-licensed Model A-E ventilator is the second Ford-GE Healthcare ventilator collaboration. Last week, Ford and GE Healthcare announced a separate effort to produce a simplified ventilator design from GE Healthcare. The combined ventilator supply will help address the increasing surge demand for ventilators around the U.S in the fight against COVID-19, each well suited to meet time, production volume and patient care requirements.
“We applaud Ford for its efforts to lend its manufacturing capabilities to help quickly scale the Airon-licensed Model A-E ventilator and arm clinicians in the fight against COVID-19,” said GE Healthcare President and CEO Kieran Murphy. “Our deep understanding of the health care industry with Ford’s supply chain and production expertise will help meet the unprecedented demand for medical equipment. We continue to be encouraged by how quickly companies are coming together in innovative ways to address this collective challenge.”
GE Heathcare and Ford consulted with medical experts in determining the Airon-licensed Model A-E ventilator is well suited for COVID-19 patient care. The design is expected to meet the needs of most COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing. The ventilator is designed for quick setup, making it easy for healthcare workers to use – and can be deployed in an emergency room setting, during special procedures or in an intensive care unit, wherever the patient may be located.
Ford, along with the companies it is supporting, will provide additional updates as these special projects progress.

2020/03/28,2020 North American International Auto Show Canceled Amid Coronavirus Outbreak,"The North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit has been canceled as the Coronavirus continues to spread throughout Michigan. The cancellation comes as the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to repurpose the TCF Center, the venue in which NAIAS is held in downtown Detroit, as a temporary field hospital.
All tickets purchased for the 2020 North American International Auto Show, including the Public Show, Industry Preview, and Charity Preview will be fully refunded.
“Although we are disappointed, there is nothing more important to us than the health, safety and well-being of the citizens of Detroit and Michigan, and we will do what we can to support our community’s fight against the Coronavirus outbreak,” said NAIAS Executive Director Rod Alberts. “With the more than 100 convention centers and facilities around the country being considered to potentially serve as temporary hospitals, it became clear to us that TCF Center would be an inevitable option to serve as a care facility to satisfy our community’s urgent health needs.”
NAIAS Moved to 2021
The North American International Auto Show was scheduled for June for the first time this year (normally it’s held in January). With the TCF Center serving as a field hospital for the foreseeable future, NAIAS will not commence again until June of 2021. Current NAIAS Chairman Doug North said show officials are discussing plans for a fundraising activity later this year. That event would benefit the children’s charities that were designated as beneficiaries of the 2020 Charity Preview event.     
“We know these organizations rely on the money raised at Charity Preview to fund many wonderful support services for the most vulnerable in our community,” North said. “With this in mind, we will be in touch with the charities in the near future to present some ideas.”
North, who will serve as Chairman of the 2021 North American International Auto Show, also expressed gratitude to the show’s stakeholders.
“The level of excitement for the 2020 show was extraordinary, and we deeply appreciate all of the support from our OEM partners and our more than 200 valued sponsors, as well as the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan,” he continued. “We will be ready to unleash this energy and enthusiasm when June 2021 rolls around to produce the absolute best show and experience ever. We look forward to literally redefining the auto show landscape with fresh ideas and innovative opportunities for mobility activations and partnerships.”

Ticket Refunds & Donations
Charity Preview ticket holders will be given the option of a refund, or the opportunity to donate the proceeds of their refund to one of the nine designated Charity Preview beneficiaries. The NAIAS ticket office will be in contact with all ticket holders. Likewise, the NAIAS sponsorship team will be in contact with each sponsor directly to answer questions regarding refunds and their contracts.
“One of the hallmarks of NAIAS since the very beginning has been our commitment to being socially responsible,” Alberts said. “Our thoughts continue to be with those whose lives have been impacted by this devastating virus. And we support the city and state’s mission to help preserve life in the face of this challenging situation.”

2020/03/26,Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: They Say It’s a Daily Driver?! Is That True?,"The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut can be a daily driver according to the company.
With over 1,000 lb-ft. of torque, it’s a sensible vehicle to drive to the office.
If you are really doing this, then we want to work where you do. No, seriously.
The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is, to put it mildly, staggering. It is the fastest Koenigsegg ever made, and the company implies they will never attempt to make a faster series-production road car. Ever. Be that as it may, you can stay with the more track-oriented Jesko, or go for the Jesko Absolut, but the bottom line is this: The fastest Koenigsegg ever – forever.
The Swedes are an interesting lot, no? They’re all calm and rational and clean designs and everything makes sense, then BAM!, a battle axe right upside your head. The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is just like that: a battle axe right upside your noggin.
Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: Aerodynamics
We’ll get to the axe (the sharp part anyway) in a minute, but first let’s look at the handle. Koenigsegg went bonkers with the aerodynamics for the Jesko Absolut. Every surface element has been purposefully constructed to reduce drag and turbulence at higher speeds. The Jesko Absolut is a more seamless and stealthier interpretation of the Jesko.
Related: Sit down and hang on! A look at the world’s fastest cars.
The Jesko Absolut has a drag coefficient of only 0.278 Cd, impressive given how big the tires are (Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R: 265/35/20 front, 325/30/21 rear). Combine the low drag with a small frontal area (1.88 m2), mix in 1,600 bhp (on E85 fuel), and you see where this is heading.

Power-to-Weight Ratio: One to 1
What this eventually boils down to is Koenigsegg’s fanatical quest of achieving One:1. That is one (metric) ton of weight for each 1,000 kilowatts of power. And not only in a track situation, but with a tank of fuel, luggage, and two people inside.
The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut benefits from carbon fiber wishbones in the suspension, along with a carbon fiber/kevlar body. Dry weight is 2,843 lbs. with a curb weight of 3,064 lbs.
The Jesko Absolut loses the massive spoiler from the regular Jesko and, in addition to giving the car a sleeker appearance, it also contributes to that low Cd. Koenigsegg added two fins to replace the rear spoiler, taking their inspiration from the F-15 fighter jet for the design. The twin fins clean up airflow over the rear end, which stabilizes the Jesko Absolut at high speeds and reduces drag.

Engine & Transmission Tech
Right there in the middle of the Jesko Absolut is the axe itself: a twin-turbo 5.0-liter V8 that cranks out 1,600 bhp with a max torque rating of 1,500 Nm (about 1,100 lb-ft. of torque). The plant is fitted with a 180-degree crankshaft, dry sump lubrication, and a carbon fiber intake manifold. At the end of the day, the engine can hit an 8500-rpm rev limit.
The lump is mated to a Koenigsegg-developed and produced nine-speed Light Speed Transmission. The system is designed to allow gear changes instantaneously, regardless of how many gears are skipped. It uses something called Ultimate Power On Demand. Get this: it’s a predictive gear-change technology that ensures instant, abundant power is always available in the correct gear for maximum acceleration. 
And Koenigsegg hasn’t even fully wrung everything out yet! “Looking at the math and our advanced simulations – it will be unbelievably fast,” the company said in their press release.

Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut: Daily Driver?
Koenigsegg says the Jesko Absolut is truly comfortable and “streetable.” They use terms like “daily driver” and I don’t think they’re joking. They make mention of storage space and ride quality. They need to check the dosages on their meds.
Still, jump inside the Jesko Absolut and find leather or Alcantara seats, power windows, adjustable pedals and steering wheel, climate control, and Apple CarPlay. There is even a reverse camera! So who knows, maybe this thing is a daily driver after all?

2020/03/24,Ford Advances Coronavirus Medical Equipment Production,"DEARBORN, Mich., March 24, 2020 – Ford Motor Company is joining forces with 3M and GE Healthcare, and lending its manufacturing and engineering expertise to quickly expand production of urgently needed medical equipment and supplies for healthcare workers, first responders and patients fighting coronavirus.
In addition, Ford plans to assemble more than 100,000 face shields per week and leverage its in-house 3D printing capability to produce components for use in personal protective equipment.
“This is such a critical time for America and the world. It is a time for action and cooperation. By coming together across multiple industries, we can make a real difference for people in need and for those on the front lines of this crisis,” said Bill Ford, Ford’s executive chairman. “At Ford, we feel a deep obligation to step up and contribute in times of need, just as we always have through the 117-year history of our company.”
Powered Air-Purifying Respirators
Ford team members are working with 3M to increase the manufacturing capacity of their powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) designs and working jointly to develop a new design leveraging parts from both companies to meet the surge demand for first responders and health care workers. This new respirator could be produced in a Ford facility by UAW workers.
To go as fast as possible, the Ford and 3M teams have been resourcefully locating off-the-shelf parts like fans from the Ford F-150’s cooled seats for airflow, 3M HEPA air filters to filter airborne contaminants such as droplets that carry virus particles and portable tool battery packs to power these respirators for up to eight hours.
Ford is looking at how it might produce these new-generation PAPRs in one of its Michigan manufacturing facilities, helping 3M boost production potentially tenfold.
“Working with 3M and GE, we have empowered our teams of engineers and designers to be scrappy and creative to quickly help scale up production of this vital equipment,” said Jim Hackett, Ford’s president and CEO. “We’ve been in regular dialogue with federal, state and local officials to understand the areas of greatest needs. We are focusing our efforts to help increase the supply of respirators, face shields and ventilators that can help assist health care workers, first responders, critical workers as well as those who have been infected by the virus.”
“We’re exploring all available opportunities to further expand 3M’s capacity and get healthcare supplies as quickly as possible to where they’re needed most – which includes partnering with other great companies like Ford,” said Mike Roman, 3M chairman of the board and chief executive officer. “It’s crucial that we mobilize all resources to protect lives and defeat this disease, and I’m incredibly grateful to Ford and their employees for this partnership.”

Ventilators for Coronavirus Treatment
In addition, Ford and GE Healthcare are working together to expand production of a simplified version of GE Healthcare’s existing ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by COVID-19. These ventilators could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location.
“We are encouraged by how quickly companies from across industries have mobilized to address the growing challenge we collectively face from COVID-19,” said GE Healthcare President & CEO Kieran Murphy. “We are proud to bring our clinical and technical expertise to this collaboration with Ford, working together to serve unprecedented demand for this life-saving technology and urgently support customers as they meet patient needs.”
Work on this initiative ties to a request for help from U.S. government officials.
Respirators & Face Shields
Meanwhile, Ford’s U.S. design team also is quickly creating and starting to test transparent full-face shields for medical workers and first responders. The face shields fully block the face and eyes from accidental contact with liquids and when paired with N95 respirators can be a more effective way to limit potential exposure to coronavirus than N95 respirators alone.
The first 1,000 face shields will be tested this week at Detroit Mercy, Henry Ford Health Systems and Detroit Medical Center Sinai-Grace Hospitals. Roughly 75,000 of these shields are expected to be finished this week and more than 100,000 face shields per week will be produced at Ford subsidiary Troy Design and Manufacturing’s facilities in Plymouth, Mich.
Ford is leveraging its Advanced Manufacturing Center in Redford, Mich., and in-house 3D printing capabilities to manufacture components and subassemblies for use in personal protective equipment.
Ford is evaluating a separate effort not involving GE Healthcare with the U.K. government to produce additional venitlators.
In China, Ford of China joint venture partner Jiangling Motors also has donated 10 specially equipped Transit ambulance vans to hospitals in Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began. Ford is also reacquiring 165,000 N95 respirators from China that were originally sent by Ford to China earlier this year to help combat coronavirus.
Ford has also kicked off a working team to help hospitals locate and secure urgently needed surgical and N95 respirators. Ford has so far committed sending Henry Ford Health Systems 40,000 surgical masks while it locates additional supplies.
Additional companies and individuals who are interested in contributing to this effort can submit their information here at www.fordnewideas.com.
Ford, along with the companies it is supporting, will provide additional updates as these special projects progress. ",https://www.automoblog.net/2020/03/24/ford-coronavirus-equipment-production/
2020/03/21,McLaren 765LT: Ready To Blitz The Racetrack!,"The new McLaren 765LT is the spiritual successor of the brilliant 675LT released in 2015. It’s also a lightened and more hardcore version of the 720S. The 765LT is the third member of McLaren’s Super Series and is longer by 0.35 inches than a stock 720S, hence the LT or Longtail designation.
Truth be told, we knew McLaren was cooking up a storm when the company unveiled the 720S two years ago. We were told the LT version would be more powerful, lighter, and sharper to drive than a 720S. Admittedly, McLaren took its sweet time in conceiving the 765LT. But with a more powerful V8 and a track-ready persona, it was all worth the wait.
“The 765LT is faster, lighter and more powerful than any previous car with the LT badge and delivers almost telepathic driver engagement,” said Andreas Bareis, Vehicle Line Director – Super Series, McLaren Automotive. “The connection through the seat and feedback from the steering wheel is incredible, allowing a customer to fully exploit every aspect of the ‘Longtail’ abilities or simply take pleasure from each drive.”
What’s New In The McLaren 765LT?
According to McLaren’s press release, the mid-engine 765LT is the most dynamically advanced and engaging LT model ever from McLaren Automotive. Based on those words alone, it’s only natural to expect big things from McLaren’s newest track weapon.
“This car is the very essence of an LT,” Bareis added.
The McLaren 765LT is equipped with the same 4.0-liter twin-turboc V8 from the 720S. But this time, the motor is pumping out 765 PS (755 horsepower) and 590 lb-ft. of torque at 5,500 rpm. The engine, complete with a flat-plane crankshaft and dry sump lubrication, features an additional fuel pump, revised oil pump, and a re-calibrated engine management system.
The icing on the cake is the three-layer head gasket lifted from the McLaren Senna.
 Formula 1-inspired elements for the McLaren 765LT include carbon-ceramic brake discs and calipers, along with materials in the transmission. For example, the pinion and crown wheel within the transmission are made from 20NiCh, a high-performance nickel chrome commonly used in Formula 1 cars. Photo: McLaren Automotive.
Transmission Tech: Bouncing On The Limiter
Revisions here come in the form of lower gear ratios to improve in-gear acceleration by 15 percent. Also new is a “limit downshift” function for the seven-speed sequential shift gearbox. This allows the unit to execute a downshift without over-revving the motor. In the 720S, the gearbox will refuse to downshift if it senses the action will over-rev the engine.
By contrast, the transmission software of the 765LT better harmonizes road and engine speeds when finding the appropriate lower gear. McLaren uses the term “harmonize” as a fancy way to say drivers can “bounce” momentarily on the rev-limiter before the next gear engages.
Related: From 1963 to today: McLaren in Formula 1 over the years.
How Fast Is The McLaren 765LT?
It depends on how you read the numbers. For instance, the 765LT hits 60 mph in 2.7 seconds, only a tenth quicker to 60 than the 720S. What? All those stampeding horses for one-tenth of a second? It doesn’t sound too impressive, right?
Wrong. The McLaren 765LT unleashes its broad array of talents at higher speeds. It goes from zero to 124 mph in 7.2 seconds, which is 1.2 seconds faster than a 720S. That alone is enough to prove how well the engine pulls at the upper reaches of the rev range. The top speed is quoted at 205 mph in seventh gear, which is lower than the 720S and its quoted top speed of 211 mph in sixth gear.

Essential Foundations: Like a Feather
The easiest way to improve a car’s performance is to shed weight, and that’s what McLaren did in the 765LT. Overall the 765LT is 176 lbs. lighter than a 720S. The curb weight of 2,952 lbs. makes for a power-to-weight ratio of 614 bph per ton. If you opt for every weight-saving option, your 765LT will have a dry weight of 2,709 lbs.
“Any Longtail is a very special McLaren, a car that drives our designers and engineers to question how much more we can do, how far we can go,” explained Filippo D’Adamo, Program Manager of the 765LT. “In the 765LT, this has resulted in new McLaren carbon fiber technologies enabling vital weight savings, the most power and torque ever in an LT, the quickest acceleration, and the highest levels of driver engagement.” 
McLaren used carbon fiber in the body panels and for other components, including the front splitter and bumper, side skirts, rear bumper, wing and diffuser, and even the license plate holder. The vehicle is also fitted with alloy wheels (48.5 lbs. lighter than stock); lightweight racing seats; a lighter battery; and polycarbonate rear side glass to shave off another 13.2 lbs. Even the carpeting was deleted to save 5.3 lbs.
The full-titanium exhaust (24 lbs.) is 40 percent lighter than a comparable steel system, and 8.3 lbs. less than the exhaust of a 720S.

Going a Few Steps Farther
If you’re as obsessed as McLaren in cutting weight, you can specify carbon fiber for the hood; front and rear fenders; and door handles instead of aluminum. Lighter seats from the McLaren Senna are available upon request. You can even delete certain comfort and convenience features like the radio and air conditioning (which McLaren will gladly put back at no cost if you prefer!).
“Customers who want to further reduce the weight of their new 765LT, add individual touches of luxury, or enhance the car’s already striking looks are catered for by personalization services available from McLaren Special Operations,” explained Ansar Ali, Managing Director, McLaren Special Operations.
Ultimately, McLaren reduces heft for the freedom to add more discretionary weight. The 765LT is equipped with upgraded brakes from the Senna, for example. This includes the calipers and brake booster which add 9.3 lbs. of unsprung weight back into the 765LT. The one thing they don’t add is an extra expense, as the Senna’s carbon-ceramic brake discs are a no-cost option.

New Set of Legs
After tuning the engine and adding carbon fiber, McLaren shifted its attention to the 765LT’s suspension. Gone are the previous dual-rate springs with helper units in the 720S for lighter main springs that save weight across the board. With revised spring rates, re-tuned dampers, and a lower 0.2-inch ride height at the front, the 765LT’s suspension embodies what McLaren was going for from the beginning.
“A McLaren LT really challenges us to push the boundaries of what is possible – especially with regards to weight reduction – and the 765LT is no exception,” said James Warner, Chief Engineer of the 765LT. “We have investigated every area of the car to deliver even further savings: ‘helper’ springs in the suspension enable a 3.3 lbs. reduction, a bespoke lightweight center tunnel saves 3.1 lbs., and optional carbon fiber fenders are 2.6 lbs. lighter than the standard panels.”
Motorsport-style polycarbonate rear glazing is new to this generation of McLaren Super Series road cars. Lighter than glass, the material allows for a double curvature in the rear screen (that dips down in the center) to aid airflow under the active rear wing. The glazed C-pillars and powertrain service cover are also finished in polycarbonate. Photo: McLaren Automotive.
Smooth Like Butter
Aerodynamics, not surprisingly, played a big part in designing the McLaren 765LT. The car benefits from an aggressive aero kit to tame the wind while producing the highest levels of downforce. The 765LT has a larger front splitter with vertical air blades mounted lower to the ground. There’s a massive active rear wing, with a cutout in the center section, to increase downforce by 20 percent over the 720S. You’ll also find some neat air vents on top of the front fenders to better guide and direct airflow.
“The stretched silhouette that enhances aerodynamic performance and the honed physique that improves downforce and cooling – especially on track – immediately identify the new 765LT as a car that will deliver on the promise of the purest driving thrills,” said Rob Melville, Design Director, McLaren Automotive.

McLaren 765LT: Maintenance & Warranty
Normal service intervals for the 765LT are one year or 12,400 miles, whichever occurs first. McLaren’s Vehicle Warranty covers the vehicle for three years from purchase without mileage limitation, while paint surface is covered for three years; visible cosmetic corrosion for five years; and perforation corrosion of the vehicle body for 10 years.
McLaren 765LT: Pricing & Availability
McLaren is only building 765 units of the 765LT with prices expected to start around $370,000. The first deliveries should arrive by September or early October this year. The new McLaren 765LT is not cheap, but it’s hard to put a price on exclusivity and all-conquering performance.

2020/03/19,Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport: When Less Is More & 16 Is The Magic Number,"Weight reduction was the central theme behind the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport.
Bugatti’s engineers also wanted the supercar to have more grip on the track.
New wheels, tires, and a rear spoiler are among the performance treatments.
The Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport is a perfect example of the “less is more” mantra. Bugatti has released multiple iterations of the Chiron since its debut in 2016, but the Pur Sport is the lightest, most track-focused Chiron to date.
The new Chiron Pur Sport is not the most expensive Chiron ever made. Now, that honor belongs to the one-of-a-kind Bugatti La Voiture Noire with an $18.7 million price tag. Nor is it the most extreme-looking Chiron either, as the glorious Centodieci has that covered.
And the Pur Sport is not the fastest Bugatti Chiron either! That distinction belongs to the Chiron Super Sport 300+, which broke all existing production speed records by reaching a bewildering 304.7 mph at the Ehra-Lessien high-speed test track in Germany.
In short, with the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, you get less of everything. And this makes it the best Chiron in our book. But how did Bugatti do it?
Back To Basics
Turns out, the Chiron Pur Sport is perfectly fine with not being honored as the ultimate speed king. And besides, it has other priorities in mind like grand touring comfort (even over a regular Chiron) and excellent handling – the latter of which is not exactly intertwined with the Chiron’s many talents.
However, Bugatti was able to create a track-tuned Chiron by shedding weight. Lots of it. You see, a stock Chiron is still unbelievable no matter the case, but it’s not exactly a light vehicle. The Chiron tips the scales at around 4,400 lbs., so it’s clear something needed to happen to make the Pur Sport a more nimble and agile performer around the racetrack.
“All of the modifications make the Pur Sport’s handling more accurate, direct, and predictable,” said Jachin Schwalbe, Head of Bugatti Chassis Development.
16 is a magic number for the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport. The supercar features a W16 engine, while 16 kilograms of weight were cut from the wheels via new designs. Photo: Bugatti.
Less Weight = Better Handling
Bugatti engineers focused on the essentials. For instance, the Chiron Pur Sport has new, aerodynamically-enhanced magnesium wheels with aero blades. Those blades are neatly arranged in a ring formation and ventilate the brakes while also improving airflow. The new wheels are 35 lbs. lighter than the Chiron’s regular wheels.
“Lower unsprung masses result in improved grip because the wheel maintains contact with the road surface more easily,” Schwalbe added.
Meanwhile, the exhaust tips are now crafted from 3D-printed titanium. The same goes for the base panels for the brake pads, also now made from titanium. With newer and lighter brake pads, along with a lighter set of discs, Bugatti’s engineers cut another 6.6 lbs.
Further weight-saving measures were employed by deleting the magnificent but hopelessly complicated active rear wing on the regular Chiron. Instead, the Pur Sport receives a massive fixed rear wing. And since there are no hydraulics to lift or lower the wing, it saves another 22 lbs. If you do the math, the Chiron Pur Sport is 110 lbs. lighter overall than a regular Chiron. “Anyone behind the wheel will immediately feel its lightweight character through bends,” Schwalbe added.
A split paintwork design is optional for the Chiron Pur Spot. The bottom third of the vehicle is exposed carbon fiber to make it appear lower. Photo: Bugatti.
Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport: Getting a Grip!
After shedding some crucial pounds, it was time to fiddle with the suspension. Bugatti installed a new set of firmer coil springs (65 and 35 percent firmer at the front and back, respectively) to tame the body around corners. To increase both lateral acceleration and handing through those corners, The Chiron Pur Sport is rolling on bespoke Michelin/Bugatti Sport Cup 2 R tires.
Alongside firmer springs and custom tires, Bugatti re-calibrated the adaptive dampers and modified the camber values by minus 2.5 degrees. “This setup makes the Chiron Pur Sport steer more directly and accurately through bends and maintains the grip levels for a very long time – even at high speeds,” Schwalbe explained.
Related: An introduction to the Legends of Bugatti.
Functional & Focused Design
Whereas a regular Chiron is all about aero efficiency, the Pur Sport is no different. But now, more emphasis was placed on increasing downforce. The Pur Sport has a larger and more prominent horseshoe grille along with wider air inlets. The exaggerated front splitter simultaneously generates more downforce and gives the vehicle a wider stance.
“We focused particularly on the agility of the Chiron Pur Sport,” revealed Frank Heyl, Head of Exterior Design and Deputy Head Designer at Bugatti. “The vehicle generates more downforce at the rear axle while the large front splitter, air inlets, and wheel-arch vents feature optimized air outlets.”

Same W16 Engine, Different Transmission
We can’t help but wonder how Bugatti resisted the urge to tweak the engine, but it’s not as if the 8.0-liter, quad-turbo W16 motor is lacking anything. Producing 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft. of torque, the Pur Sport still has enough to jump start a dying planet.
The engine is now connected to a heavily-revised, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. According to Bugatti, the transmission is 80 percent new and has 15 percent closer gear ratios. “We reconfigured each gear and calibrated new ratios despite this iconic engine boasting an abundance of power,” said Gregor Gries, Head of Major Assemblies at Bugatti. “The gears are closer together now to enable shorter gear jumps and also benefit performance.”
The Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport has a top speed of 218 mph, and is savage enough to go from 37 mph to 75 mph a full two seconds faster than a stock Chiron. “Most of all, when coming out of corners, the Chiron Pur Sport accelerates even more aggressively with the added grip and more direct chassis and suspension,” Gries added.

Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport: Pricing & Availability
The Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport is limited to only 60 units globally with prices starting at around $3.35 million. Production starts in the second half of this year, with the first deliveries arriving in late 2020 and early 2021.

2020/03/19,2020 Audi RS Q8: A Little Something Extra For The Everyday,"The 2020 RS Q8 is the first SUV from Audi in the United States to have an RS badge.
Under the hood, a turbo V8 creates nearly 600 horsepower and 600 lb-ft. of torque.
At the famous Nürburgring racetrack, the RS Q8 set a new speed record for an SUV.
The 2020 Audi RS Q8 combines the company’s high-performance RS undertones with the practicality of a full-size SUV. Powered by a bi-turbo V8 engine, the RS Q8 looks to set a new standard as the prestigious spearhead of the RS model line.
Or so sayeth Audi.
I recently wrote about Audi’s big boy SUV, the Q7, and it gives you whatever you could want, but what if you want more? And what if what you want more of is performance? Then say hi to the Audi RS Q8. The first Audi SUV to carry an RS badge. Yes, it’s an SUV, and a big one at that. So we’ll get to all the “practical” stuff in a bit, but this guy wears an RS badge, and that means performance. So let’s look at the performance bits first, shall we?
2020 Audi RS Q8: The Good Stuff
Resting within the engine room of the RS Q8 is a 4.0-liter V8 that delivers an imposing 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft. of torque. That’s good enough to move it from zero to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds. Yeah, that sounds only middling these days, but this is a huge SUV we’re talking about. Audi (for obvious reasons) doesn’t provide a curb weight figure in their press release, but you know this thing is no Lotus 7 – shoot, this thing is probably not even three Lotus 7s. 3.7 seconds to freeway speed is a miracle.
Top speed is 155 mph, or 190 mph when equipped with the RS ceramic brakes. So get the RS ceramic brakes. Add it all up, and this makes the RS Q8 the fastest production SUV to lap the Nürburgring with an official time of seven minutes and 42 seconds.
Is The 2020 Audi RS Q8 All-Wheel Drive?
Of course there’s the quattro all-wheel drive system that lives just south of the standard eight-speed Tiptronic transmission. Front and rear torque split is set to 40:60 and, when required, can transfer up to 70 percent to the front and up to 85 percent to the rear. The RS Q8 also uses wheel-selective torque for improved handling and additional traction adjustments across each axle. When you’re really on it, the quattro sport rear differential distributes torque between the rear wheels as needed via active torque vectoring. This again is to improve traction and stability.
To help keep everything stable at higher speeds, Audi says the roof-edge spoiler produces more downforce on the rear axle.
The suspension, in and of itself, is almost as impressive as the drivetrain. The RS Q8 features an adaptive air suspension standard. Obviously it is specific to this RS model and offers the driver a choice between comfort and performance settings. All-wheel steering is also standard along with active roll stabilization.

Exhaust Notes & Driver Profiles
You can customize your driving experience through the Audi drive select system with seven different profiles: comfort, auto, dynamic, allroad, offroad, and the individually configurable RS-specific modes RS1 and RS2. Those last two you can turn on via the “RS-MODE” button on the steering wheel.
Audi drive select lets you configure different settings for the engine and transmission, power steering, air suspension, and all-wheel steering. It also lets you mess with the engine’s sound. Typical for RS models, the RS Q8 has a dual exhaust with an oval tailpipe on each side, and if you’d like, there’s an optional RS sport exhaust with black tailpipes for an even sportier sound.

2020 Audi RS Q8: Interior Treatments
The interior of the new RS Q8 is somewhere between spaceship and luxury liner, with the central feature being the MMI touch response system. There are special RS displays through Audi’s virtual cockpit, and the 12.3-inch display offers information like power output, g-forces, lap times, drivetrain temperatures, and tire pressure. There’s a shift light display for up-shifts when the rev limit is reached, and the optional heads-up display also offers several RS-specific graphics.

There’s also practical stuff inside too, like the sliding three-seat rear bench. Fold that down, and there is 60.7 cubic feet of space available in the luggage compartment under the power rear hatch.

2020/03/18,GM Suspends North American Production To Help Contain Coronavirus,"DETROIT – General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) confirmed it will begin a systematic and orderly suspension of manufacturing operations in North America due to market conditions and to deep clean facilities in response to the Coronavirus. The suspension will last until at least March 30th. Production status will be reevaluated week-to-week after that.
“GM and the UAW have always put the health and safety of the people entering GM plants first, and we have agreed to a systematic, orderly suspension of production to aid in fighting COVID-19/Coronavirus,” said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. “We have been taking extraordinary precautions around the world to keep our plant environments safe and recent developments in North America make it clear this is the right thing to do now. I appreciate the teamwork of UAW President Rory Gamble, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, and local leadership as we take this unprecedented step.”
“UAW members, their families, and our communities will benefit from today’s announcement with the certainty that we are doing all that we can to protect our health and safety during this pandemic,” said UAW President Rory Gamble. “This will give us time to review best practices and to prevent the spread of this disease. We appreciate General Motors’ actions today and will continue to work with them on health and safety plans to be implemented when we resume production.”
To ensure that production stops in a safe and orderly fashion, plants will suspend operations in a cadence, with each facility receiving specific instructions from manufacturing leadership.

2020/03/18,Ford Reduces North American Production To Help Contain Coronavirus,"DEARBORN, Michigan, March 18, 2020 – Following Thursday evening shifts, Ford is temporarily suspending production at its manufacturing sites in North America through March 30th to thoroughly clean its facilities to protect its workforce and boost containment efforts for the COVID-19 Coronavirus.
“We’re continuing to work closely with union leaders, especially the United Auto Workers, to find ways to help keep our workforce healthy and safe – even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s President of North America. “In these unprecedented times, we’re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.”
Working To Prevent The Spread of Coronavirus
UAW and Ford leaders will work together in the coming weeks on plant restart plans as well as exploring additional protocols and procedures for helping prevent the spread of the virus. Chief among them: finding ways to maximize social distancing among plant workers – both during work hours and at shift change, when large numbers of people typically gather at entry and exit points and maximizing cleaning times between shift changes.
“Today’s action is the prudent thing to do. By taking a shutdown and working through next steps, we protect UAW members, their families and the community,” said Rory Gamble, President of the UAW. “We have time to review best practices when the plants reopen, and we prevent the possible spread of this pandemic. We commend Ford for working with us and taking this bold step.”

Plant Closures In Michigan For Ford
Ford temporarily closed Michigan Assembly Plant this morning after an employee tested positive for the COVID-19 Coronavirus, and is thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the building as part of the company’s Coronavirus emergency response protocol. Michigan Assembly will halt production through March 30th.
In addition, the company will instruct people who have had direct contact with that infected employee to self-quarantine and get medical attention. Those who have had close contact to those who have had direct contact are asked watch for symptoms and seek medical attention if they feel unwell.
The move to temporarily close plants follows Sunday’s news that Ford leaders are forming a Coronavirus Task Force along with the UAW, General Motors, and FCA leaders to implement enhanced protections for manufacturing and warehouse employees at all three companies. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford and President and CEO Jim Hackett, UAW President Rory Gamble, GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, and FCA CEO Michael Manley are leading the task force. The three companies formed a similar task force in Canada.
“Together, we’ll continue finding solutions and best practices that help keep workers at our plants and parts distribution centers healthy and safe throughout our operations,” said Gary Johnson, Chief Manufacturing and Labor Affairs Officer, Ford Motor Company.
Ford Pauses Production Overseas
In addition, Ford vehicle manufacturing sites in Cologne and Saarlouis in Germany, together with the Craiova facility in Romania, will temporarily halt production starting Thursday. Ford’s Valencia assembly and engine facility in Spain already temporarily halted production from Monday, after three workers were confirmed with Coronavirus over the past weekend.
On Monday, Ford asked all salaried employees – except those performing business critical roles that can’t be done off site – to work remotely until further notice.
“Especially in these challenging times, we must continue working together and putting people first,” Galhotra said.

2020/03/18,AutoSens Detroit Postponed Amid Coronavirus Outbreak,"AutoSens Detroit is postponed until November amid the global Coronavirus outbreak. The three-day workshop, conference, and exhibition centered on vehicle perception technology and autonomous driving was originally scheduled for May 12th through the 14th at the Michigan Science Center.
“After extensive consultation with our key stakeholders, it is clear it would be impossible to run a successful face-to-face conference in Detroit this May,” writes Robert Stead, Managing Director of AutoSens in an open letter to the engineering community. “We run this event for our community, and our priorities are ensuring you get the best possible experience at AutoSens, as well as the safety and security for everyone involved.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are recommending no gatherings of over 50 people take place for the next eight weeks to slow the spread of the Coronavirus. In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed executive orders closing restaurants, coffee shops, gyms and numerous other retail, dining, and entertainment outlets. Earlier this week, the UAW and Detroit’s Big Three automakers announced plans to implement a Coronavirus task force.
News Dates Set For AutoSens
AutoSens holds yearly events in Brussels, Detroit, and Hong Kong. The conference gathers engineers, researchers, technologists, and other industry professionals to examine the challenges facing autonomous cars at nearly every level, from the supply chain to research and development. Each conference provides attendees a robust and informative agenda. Before its postponement, AutoSens Detroit this year was to include four keynote sessions, track demos, and over 60 expert speakers.
AutoSens Detroit is now scheduled for November 17th through the 19th at the Michigan Science Center. In order to support the engineering community in the interim, organizers are working to launch several online initiatives over the coming weeks and months. “Keep May 12th through the 14th in your diary, as you’ll have the opportunity to participate in our online event activities,” Stead added.
AutoSens Brussels is unaffected at this time and will go on as planned. The Brussels event is scheduled for September 15th through the 17th at the city’s famed Autoworld Museum. AutoSens Hong Kong, originally scheduled for November, will now take place early next year.
Organizers are optimistic but also cautious as events around the globe have either been delayed or cancelled. “We have been monitoring the situation closely,” Stead said. “We are committed to delivering a great experience for the AutoSens community and will work hard towards that goal for later in the year.”

2020/03/13,Automakers Respond To Coronavirus,"From Mary T. Barra, CEO of General Motors
As the coronavirus continues to evolve, we have important updates to our working policies to share.
If the nature of your work allows for it, we are asking all GM employees and contract workers to work remotely, beginning Monday, March 16. This policy applies globally, apart from our team in China, which has existing protocols in place. Please speak with your direct manager about what this means for you.
Contract workers should contact their employers for further direction.
These are important steps to lower the probability of spreading the coronavirus to coworkers, families and communities and to relieve the burden on public resources. It also helps conserve critical resources like cleaning crews, medical staff, and supplies so they can be deployed where they are most needed.
These are extraordinary times and we are focused on navigating the situation responsibly. Our IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it’s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering. We need you to stay in close contact with your leader and your teams to ensure continuity of work.
Of course, not all of our teams are able to work remotely. We are taking every precaution to ensure our teams remain safe and are adjusting manufacturing, Global Product Development, Customer Care and Aftersales and Contact Center work schedules to allow for additional cleaning. Given the current drop in use of public transportation and extensive flight cancellations, our customers are looking to us more than ever to ensure they have the vehicles, parts and services they need. Thank you to everyone for helping to ensure that we continue to deliver.
We will be posting updates regularly. Government policies vary by country; please make sure you work closely with your leader to stay compliant in your area.
I understand how uncertain these times feel. For many of us, it’s our first experience of this type. But disruption and trying circumstances are not new to us. Especially in times like these, we demonstrate our flexibility, agility and resilience. This team always rises to the occasion and just as we have in the past, we will chart our course.
From Ford Motor Company
DEARBORN, Mich., March 31, 2020 – Ford is delaying the restart of production at its North America plants to help protect its workers. The company had been aiming to restart production April 6 at Hermosillo Assembly Plant and April 14 at several key U.S. plants – and now has further postponed startup dates, which will be announced later.
“The health and safety of our workforce, dealers, customers, partners and communities remains our highest priority,” said Kumar Galhotra, Ford president, North America. “We are working very closely with union leaders – especially at the UAW – to develop additional health and safety procedures aimed at helping keep our workforce safe and healthy.”
Rawsonville Components Plant will restart the week of April 20 to produce the Model A-E ventilator, in collaboration with GE Healthcare, supported by paid volunteer UAW workers. The Model A-E ventilator is a basic, cost-efficient design that addresses the needs of most COVID-19 patients. Production will quickly scale up to produce 50,000 ventilators by July 4 – helping to meet the growing demand in the U.S. Approximately 500 paid volunteer UAW workers will be building these ventilators. At this time, ventilator production will be the only work being done at the Rawsonville plant.
“Today’s decision by Ford is the right decision for our members, their families and our nation,” said UAW International President Rory Gamble. “Under Vice President Gerald Kariem, the UAW Ford Department continues to work closely with our local unions and Ford to make sure that as we return to production all members are safe, and our communities are protected from this spreading pandemic.”
When Rawsonville Components Plant begins production of ventilators, the workforce will notice additional health measures in place. Workers will have to self-certify online every day that they are not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms. If they are, they will not be allowed to work. Work stations will be spaced at least six feet apart to maintain proper social distancing. Shifts will be separated so there is no contact between workers in the different shifts.
Ford and the UAW are also working on several high-tech solutions to help keep our workforce safe. As developments unfold, we will share additional details.

Mazda North American Operations
In a message to company employees, Mazda North American Operations President Jeff Guyton writes:
Team,
Each day, news of the coronavirus, its scale and human impact, continues to grow. Many of us know individuals who are already affected, or we are experiencing uncertainty about what will happen in our own communities.
These are challenging times for everyone, and I’m here to say Mazda is with you. Our company has seen its fair share of challenges over the last 100 years, and I am confident that our resilience and challenger spirit will help us navigate the coronavirus and all that comes with and beyond it.
While there have been no confirmed cases in any of our MNAO offices, it is our responsibility to try to keep it that way by prioritizing your health and well-being. Through that lens, a rapid response team is actively monitoring the situation and will continue to make decisions designed to keep us safe and healthy during this time.

My dad was a doctor. His constant advice to me as a child was “keep your hands washed, and keep them away from your face, especially your eyes and nose.” That was good advice then and it appears to be doubly so now. Please take care of yourself, your families and your communities as we’re all in this together.
On Tuesday, March 24, the below statement was issued by Mazda Corporate in reaction to the coronavirus.
Mazda Motor Corporation would like to express our deepest sympathy and concern for all those who have been suffering from the novel coronavirus outbreak and extend our sincere condolences to the families of the deceased.
In response to the global spread of the novel coronavirus, many countries have been quickly and extensively reinforcing their infection prevention measures, including curfew implementation, retail business suspensions and restrictions on corporate activities. Mazda has decided to adjust production at our global facilities in consideration of difficulties in parts procurement, the declining global sales, and the uncertainty of future markets.
Mazda plans to suspend production for 13 days and operate daytime-only shifts for eight days at the Hiroshima Plant and Hofu Plant from March 28 to April 30. Mazda intends to transfer part of the production originally scheduled for this period to the second quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2021 or later as we monitor how the situation develops. During this period, administrative operations will be undertaken as usual.
Outside Japan, Mazda de Mexico Vehicle Operation, our production site in Mexico, will shut down for approximately 10 days, beginning March 25, and AutoAlliance (Thailand) Co., Ltd., our production site in Thailand, will suspend production for approximately 10 days, beginning March 30.
Mazda places the highest priority on health and safety of local residents, customers and employees, and will continue to take infection prevention measures such as teleworking and sanitizing the Mazda offices and dealerships.
From Honda North America
As the unprecedented economic impact of the fast-changing COVID-19 pandemic worsens, Honda continues to evaluate conditions and make temporary adjustments to its production operations in the U.S. and Canada.
In addition to the impact of COVID-19 on the marketplace, stay-at-home orders in many cities and states prevent consumers in a number of markets from purchasing new vehicles. As a result, Honda must continue to suspend production in order to align product supply with a lack of market demand.
The following actions are in response to the continued steep decline in sales across the automobile and powersports industries:

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and decline in vehicle demand, Toyota is further extending the length of its production suspension at all of its automobile and components plants in North America, including Canada, Mexico and the U.S. The manufacturing facilities will remain closed through May 1, resuming production on May 4.
Our service parts operations and finished vehicle logistics centers will continue to operate in order to meet the ongoing needs of our customers.
The safety and security of our employees, stakeholders and community are a top priority and we will continue to monitor the situation and take action in a timely manner.
From Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA)
FCA continues to take important steps to help flatten the curve of the spread of COVID-19 and put the health and safety of our workforce, and the communities where we live and work, first. FCA plants across the U.S. and Canada, as well as headquarters operations and construction projects, are intended to remain closed until April 14, dependent upon the various states’ stay-in-place orders and the readiness of each facility to return to production.
The Mopar Parts Distribution Centers, which have been deemed essential to keeping first responders and commercial vehicles on the road, will continue to operate with paid volunteers. The status of production for FCA’s Mexico operations will be subject to a separate announcement.
FCA continues to work collaboratively with the UAW and Unifor to expand upon the extensive program of cleaning and social distancing protocols that already have been implemented across all of our facilities to safeguard our employees. 
From Volkswagen
The health and safety of our team remains our highest priority. Volkswagen Chattanooga will remain closed next week, extending the shutdown period which began March 21. We plan to resume production Sunday, April 5 at 10 p.m.
We will continue to provide full pay next week for all team members at the factory. Employees who are able to telework, such as office staff, will continue to do so. We’re asking all employees to self-quarantine and maintain social distancing as directed by the CDC.

From Volvo Car Group 
The corona pandemic is now severely affecting Volvo Cars in many ways, in the form of a weakening market, a risk for production disruption as well as concerns for the employees. The company´s primary focus is the health and safety of all employees. Precautionary measures and travel restrictions have already been taken.
Now, there is a need to further reduce the spread of the virus by going into a period of social distancing. This means production closures, working from home and taking more personal precautions.
The Belgium plant will remain closed until April 5. The Swedish and US plants will be closed between March 26 and April 14. People working in our offices will generally work from home as of March 26 and working hours will be reduced.
These actions will secure jobs and ensure that Volvo Cars can come back to normal production as soon as it is possible and safe.
Earlier this month Volvo Cars reopened its four manufacturing plants in China after an extended closure period. Today´s showroom traffic is indicating a return to normal in China’s car market which is clearly demonstrating the advantages of being a globally balanced company.
“Our primary concerns are the health of our employees and the future of our business,” said Håkan Samuelsson, chief executive. “With the help of valuable supporting programs put in place by governments and authorities, we have been able to act quickly.”
Volvo Cars is confident that these measures strike the right balance between mitigating the continuing impact of the pandemic and protecting its people and the company’s future.
The Volvo Cars manufacturing plants impacted by the measures announced today are located in Torslanda, Skövde and Olofström (all Sweden), Ghent (Belgium) and South Carolina (United States). The affected office employees work at the company’s headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden, as well as at the Ghent plant and in its markets.

These are trying times for everyone, and I wanted to reach out to you personally about what we are doing here at Mitsubishi Motors to support our employee team and you, as a past, present, or future Mitsubishi Motors vehicle owner, in this time of COVID-19.
As of Monday, March 16, all Mitsubishi Motors North America headquarters and regional team members are working remotely from a home office for their safety and the safety and well-being of their families. With schools closed in many areas of the country, this has made it easier for our team members to react to their changing needs at home as well.
While working from home, the Mitsubishi Motors team is committed to continuing support for our many dealer partners across the United States, including providing them with additional guidance on cleaning and sanitizing their facilities. Each and every Mitsubishi Motors dealership is an independently owned business, and they are part of your community. Most dealers are still able to provide the sales, service, advice and support you need, and many have also put in place remote drop-off ability or other ways to minimize person-to-person contact.
If you currently own a Mitsubishi vehicle that is financed through Ally, our financial partner, you may contact them for up to 120 days of payment deferments. If you should decide that now is the time to purchase a new vehicle, Ally is also offering up to 90-days deferred payments on your purchase, depending on individual credit. This is all to make it easier for those impacted by business slow- or shut-downs to ensure you continue to have access to safe, reliable, innovative transportation.
This situation will pass soon, and when it does, I want you to know that Mitsubishi Motors will be here to continue to support your long-term purchase and service needs.
We’re in this together, let’s all help each other. Take care, stay safe, and thank you for your trust.
From Automobili Lamborghini 
Automobili Lamborghini has intensified measures taken against Coronavirus in support of new government directives, closing its premises from 13 March until 25 March 2020. 
Stefano Domenicali, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Automobili Lamborghini comments: 
“This measure is an act of social responsibility and high sensibility towards our people, in the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves right now in Italy and which is also evolving abroad due to the worldwide spread of Coronavirus. As we have done up until now, we continue to monitor the situation in order to react rapidly and with the right flexibility, in collaboration with our people and in order to restart with energy in the right moment.”
From Bugatti
Bugatti is suspending production of its hyper sports cars in Molsheim from today, March 20th, 2020. The various necessary regulations implemented by European governments to combat the COVID-19 pandemic make it impossible, amongst other things, to maintain the supply chain of production and spare parts.
In addition, it is almost impossible to deliver vehicles completed in the Atelier to their owners due to the travel restrictions. Bugatti supports the regulations that have been implemented by European governments as well as the recommendations of health experts and will intensify the measures already taken.
“Today we decided to suspend production to protect our staff and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from spreading to our sites,” says Stephan Winkelmann, President of Bugatti. “In this extreme situation, our social responsibility demands that we take such a drastic step. For us, the health of our staff and their families, our customers, our business partners and suppliers has top priority.”
There has already been a ban on business travel in recent weeks. Through the expansion of mobile work wherever possible, most employees have also already been working from home for some days. Now, the employees who have been working directly on the French hyper sports cars will also stay at home for the time being. Special protective measures additionally apply to employees with a particular health risk due to pre-existing conditions related to their heart, lungs and a weakened immune system.
Bugatti would like to remind everyone that we are all advised to adhere to the recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and their respective local governments to stop the spread of the virus. These include:
Thoroughly washing your hands
Keeping to the guidelines on coughing and sneezing
Refraining from shaking hands
Touching your face as little as possible
Keeping your distance from persons that are visibly suffering from respiratory illnesses
Generally staying at home whenever possible
Stephan Winkelmann would like to thank all Bugatti employees who have been developing, producing or selling extraordinary vehicles over the past weeks and months with commitment and passion despite the coronavirus crisis. He would particularly like to thank medical support staff who have been exceptional, true heroes in all regions, particularly in France’s Grand Est region.
“Over the coming days and weeks we will continue to keep a close eye on the situation in France, Germany and throughout the world to be able to quickly react to any changes. As soon as the situation permits, all employees will return to their usual workplaces. Until then, I hope that all staff members and Bugatti enthusiasts stay healthy,” concludes Stephan Winkelmann.
From Bentley Motors
Bentley Motors will suspend production at its Crewe, UK, factory headquarters for four weeks.
This decision is based on the accelerated rate of infection by coronavirus and understandable restrictions applied, the resulting interruptions in supply chain that will soon be seen, as well as declining demand on some automotive markets. But most importantly the decision is to protect the health of Bentley’s many colleagues, their families and communities.
Core business functions will continue throughout the shutdown with colleagues either based in Crewe, following social distancing policies, or working remotely. Production will not start again until 20 April.
Adrian Hallmark, Chairman and CEO of Bentley Motors, said: “The well-being of our colleagues is our number one priority and although this was a difficult decision to take, and doesn’t change our strategic direction, it was necessary to protect them as best we can during these unprecedented times. This will inevitably have an impact on our deliveries to customers, and we apologise for the inconvenience this causes, however we are working hard to minimize this disruption. Our thoughts continue to go out to all those affected around the world throughout this very sad and difficult time for so many people.’
To protect its employees, Bentley had implemented further measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, for example, changing operations at company canteen and shops, introducing safe behaviours and closing the company gym facilities. As a general principle, all meetings will be held by Skype or video and all major events have been postponed or cancelled.
From Jaguar Land Rover
In light of the ongoing coronavirus situation, Jaguar Land Rover has confirmed that it will temporarily suspend production at its UK manufacturing facilities over the course of next week. The company’s intention is to resume in the week of 20 April, subject to review of the rapidly-changing circumstances. 
As a responsible business, Jaguar Land Rover is operating in line with advice from the NHS and Public Health England to minimise the spread of the coronavirus, whilst implementing plans to safeguard its business continuity. The company will work towards an orderly return to production once conditions permit. 
Currently, Jaguar Land Rover’s manufacturing plants in Brazil and India continue operating. The company’s joint venture plant in China reopened in the week of 24 February, as life begins to get back to normal in the country. 
Although the company’s focus must be on its business and responsibilities to employees, Jaguar Land Rover is doing whatever it can to support its communities through the current situation. The company’s thoughts are with those directly affected by COVID-19 and with the healthcare professionals, whose role in combating this virus is appreciated by all.
From INDYCAR
Due to ongoing concerns over the COVID-19 “coronavirus” pandemic conditions, INDYCAR is postponing the first four events on the 2020 calendar, including this weekend’s Firestone IndyCar Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.
Other events suspended include the April 5 Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama, the April 19 Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach, and the April 26 AutoNation IndyCar Challenge at the Circuit of the Americas.
The 2020 NTT INDYCAR SERIES season now is scheduled to resume with the May 9 GMR Grand Prix of Indianapolis, on the road course at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
The end of this weekend’s event also means the SRO Touring Car America’s double header race weekend at St. Petersburg will not take place.
Official Statement from INDYCAR:
“After careful consideration, including regular communication with our event promoters, health officials, and the city administrations in our respective race markets regarding COVID-19, we have made the decision to halt all NTT INDYCAR Series events through April. This begins with the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg which was to begin today and run through Sunday, March 15 and continues through the AutoNation INDYCAR Challenge at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas which was to take place April 24-26.”
“Although we are disappointed to delay the start to this INDYCAR season and will miss our incredible fans who support us each year in St. Petersburg, Birmingham, Long Beach, and Austin, the safety of our fans, participants, staff, partners, and media will always remain our top priority. We will continue to coordinate with public health experts and government officials as we determine the appropriate plans for resuming our schedule.”

2020/03/12,Porsche 911 Turbo S: Most Powerful 911 Turbo Yet,"Porsche has rolled out the new-generation 911 Turbo S, the quickest and most powerful 911 Turbo model ever, which is saying a lot. The 911 Turbo S offers a mouthwatering 640 horsepower, advanced driving dynamics in terms of aerodynamics and the suspension, and even everyday usability (as far as a sport car goes). And for those who like the wind in their hair, the Porsche 911 Turbo S is also available as a cabriolet.
An Instant Classic
Porsche has been making 911s since before most of our readers were alive. Given the changes in the automotive world in the past half-century, that in itself is a minor miracle and testament to just how far you can push a good initial design. Besides getting bigger and heavier over time (hey, middle age has its way with all of us) the 911 is largely the same.
Oh sure, they took air-cooling about as far as thermally possible and started water cooling their flat sixes a while back, but if you were to put a gearhead from 1965 in a time machine and bring them to today, show them this, the new Porsche 911 Turbo S, they’d spot it right away.
Porsche 911 Turbo S: Engine & Transmission
As with all 911s, it’s always about the engine and putting power to the ground. Turbo 911s even more so. For this version, the engine bay is occupied by a new 3.8-liter six-cylinder boxer plant with two turbochargers, electrically-adjustable waste gate flaps, and piezo injectors. Gone are the 930s of yore and their glacially slow turbo spool up. Turbo lag is a thing of the past, or so says Porsche.
The engine in the new 911 Turbo S puts out a healthy 60 horsepower more than its predecessor. Maximum torque, likewise, gets a bump and now stands at 590 lb-ft.,  an increase of 37 lb-ft. This plant is paired with a Turbo-specific eight-speed Porsche PDK (Doppelkupplung) dual-clutch transmission. A smart idea, given the bump in power and especially torque.
The bottom line is zero to 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds. It plummets to an absurdly slow 2.7 seconds for the cabriolet. Wait, did I say slow? I meant absurdly fast! The mid-2s, coupe or convert, is wickedly fast. And speaking of improvements, that’s a 0.2 second reduction compared to previous 911 Turbos. The standing quarter mile is dispatched in 10.5 seconds and the top speed for both Turbo S models is 205 mph.
At the heart of the Porsche 911 Turbo S are two symmetrical turbochargers with variable turbine geometry. The diameter of the turbine wheels has increased by five millimeters to 55 mm, while the 61 mm compressor wheel is now three millimeters larger than before. The waste gate flaps are electrically-controlled using stepper motors. Photo: Porsche Cars North America.
Wider Footprint & Big Tires
The new 911 Turbo S is wider than its predecessor by approximately 1.8 inches in front (72.44 inches in total). The overall width is 74.8 inches at the rear axle, with the track now 1.65 inches wider at the front and 0.39 inches wider at the rear. Along with the modified track widths are new tires and aerodynamic treatments.
The aero package now includes adaptive cooling flaps at the front, and the larger rear wing for more downforce. Another first this time around are staggered center-lock wheels: 20-inch wheels at the nose, wrapped in model-specific 255/35 tires, and 21-inch rear wheels with Flintstone-esque 315/30 tires. That’s 10 millimeters more tire width versus the 2020 911 Carrera S models and previous 911 Turbo.
The charge air coolers, now 14 percent larger than before, were moved from their previous position in the rear fenders to directly behind the engine. This change increases air flow rate by about 13 percent. Photo: Porsche Cars North America.
Braking, Exhaust & Suspension
Options are few and far between – actually – there’s only two. There’s Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) that lowers ride height by 0.39 inches (a 10 mm drop) over the standard suspension. There’s also a Sport Exhaust System with adjustable flaps and distinct oval tailpipes.
As on the previous 911 Turbo S, there’s Porsche’s Dynamic Chassis Control, rear-axle steering, and Porsche’s Ceramic Composite Brakes with 10-piston front calipers standard. Also, the front brake rotors have gone up from 410 mm on the previous model to 420 mm.

Porsche 911 Turbo S: Pricing & Availability
The 2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S Coupe starts at $203,500, while the 911 Turbo S Cabriolet will begin at $216,300. Tack on another $1,350 for destination. Porsche says both will be available to order soon and are expected to reach U.S. dealers in late 2020.
It’s a common misconception that if a 911 is your dream car it’s impossible to own one because of cost. Author Robert McGowan has a great book about how to do this. McGowan is an active and respected member of both national and international Porsche clubs and forums, and is currently on his third Porsche. His book explains how you can own your dream 911 even on a budget.

2020/03/12,2021 Audi RS 7: Widebody Sportback Is Pleasing To The Eye,"2021 Audi RS 7 receives a new widebody treatment with flared wheel arches.
Adaptive air suspension with three different modes tuned specifically for the RS 7.
Under the hood of the RS 7 is a bi-turbo engine producing nearly 600 horsepower.
The second generation of the RS 7 is among the latest in the growing RS line, which is kind of like an Audi skunkworks program in terms of performance. The big five-door sportback is motivated by a 4.0-liter bi-turbo V8 that cranks out 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft. of torque. Add the lowered stance, RS styling cues (like flared wheel arches), and quattro all-wheel drive, and you’ve got yourself an all-weather go-fast machine.
What Is The 2021 Audi RS 7? Well It’s Wider . . .
The Audi RS 7, or even the A7 for that matter, is a bit of an odd looking thing. Big, four-door hatchbacks can give rise to a lot of styling issues. If you’re not careful, they can look ungainly and ill-proportioned. The Audi RS 7 looks rather handsome, if also rather large. Audi calls it the “sportback body style,” but for 2021, it also means the RS 7 is getting the widebody treatment for the first time.
The flared wheel arches on the RS 7 add nearly an inch of width, although the hood, roof, front doors, and tailgate are the same as on other models. The grille is, of course, different on the RS 7 with its honeycomb structure finished in gloss back. The headlights are matrix-LED laser units and the front bumper is peculiar to the RS with side air inlets that extend into the lower edge of the headlights.
At the back you’ll find the sweeping lip spoiler which pops up at speeds above 60 mph; the RS exhaust system with large, oval tailpipes; and the RS-specific bumper with a rear diffuser in gloss black. Wheels are as monstrous as the RS 7’s power: standard 21-inchers with summer tires, or the available Black Optic or Carbon Optic 22-inch wheels. The latter includes a black grille and black or carbon exterior accents.

2020 Audi RS 7: Getting Under The Hood
Speaking of monstrous power, if you pop the hood on the RS 7 you’ll find the 4.0-liter TFSI bi-turbo V8 that brings 591 horsepower and 590 lb-ft. of torque to the party. In case you’re wondering, that is 147 more ponies and 147 more lb-ft. of torque over the S7. So it’s like having an invisible Miata pushing you along at all times.
Zero to 60? 3.5 seconds! Top speed? 190 mph. Schnell!
Audi’s quattro is standard (of course) and actively splits torque between each of the rear wheels – with the ability to direct nearly all torque to one wheel. Gear selection is handled by an eight-speed tiptronic with a new launch control function. Coming to a halt is handled by RS ceramic brakes, available with red or gray calipers.
Essential Foundations: Two Options
The standard underpinnings of the 2021 Audi RS 7 is an adaptive air setup specifically tuned to suit the RS model. Naturally it can be adjusted between three different modes, geared from long-distance comfort to high-performance driving. The optional RS sport suspension with Dynamic Ride Control integrates roll and pitch compensation but ditches the electronics for good old steel springs and three-way adjustable dampers.
Related: What you might pay to maintain a new Audi.
The final chassis touch is the standard all-wheel steering that enables the angle of the front and rear wheels to be adjusted independently, for increased maneuverability at low speeds and better stability at high speeds.
Audi Drive Select
The Audi drive select system lets you adjust the driving characteristics to one of six profiles, including the RS-specific RS1 and RS2 modes via a button on the steering wheel. The 2021 RS 7 sits 0.4 inches lower than the A7 in Auto, Comfort, and Efficiency modes, but at speeds above 75 mph, or in Dynamic mode, the air suspension drops the body another 0.4 inches.
Related: Understanding Audi’s factory warranty and if you need more.
The engine note can be adjusted using the Audi drive select system too. If you want more “noise” there’s an optional Sport Exhaust for a “more pronounced” sound.

Interior Treatments: The Virtual Cockpit
The inside of the RS 7 is much more driver-focused than its lesser brethren, with lots of RS accents and cool tech. There’s the standard MMI touch response system with haptic and acoustic feedback. The 10.1-inch upper display controls infotainment and navigation functions, and the 8.6-inch lower display takes care of climate control, comfort, and convenience functions.
Also standard is the second-gen Audi virtual cockpit. It comes with a 12.3-inch HD display that enhances things like navigation through satellite imagery or 3D city maps. There is also a special RS display for tire pressure, torque, power output, engine oil temperature, boost pressure, lap times, acceleration measurements, and g forces.
The RS sport seats are upholstered with Valcona leather and feature a honeycomb pattern and RS embossing. Also standard is the perforated and heated leather steering wheel with new aluminum shift paddles.

2021 Audi RS 7: Pricing & Availability
The only bad news (besides the speeding tickets) is how the 2021 Audi RS 7 starts at $114,995, which is a lot, but also in line with what the outgoing model sells for. Expect the 2021 Audi RS 7 this spring.

2020/03/05,2021 VW Atlas: MSRP & Trim Levels (Handy Chart Included),"Pricing for the 2021 VW Atlas was recently announced.
There are eight trim levels and three standalone options.
The 2021 VW Atlas will start at $32,565 (with destination) when it arrives during the second quarter of this year. There are eight trim levels for the 2021 Atlas, three standalone options, and two engine choices. The standalone options for 2021 are both fun and functional, and include captain’s chairs, a panoramic sunroof, and a towing package.
What Is The VW Atlas?
The VW Atlas is relatively new, hitting the market for the first time in 2018. The Atlas is built on VW’s Modular Transverse Matrix (MQB) architecture and is the automaker’s largest vehicle in the U.S. (198.3 inches long, 78.3 inches wide, and 70 inches high).
Given its size, the VW Atlas can seat seven.
Those who like the Atlas, but want something a little more athletic and sporty, might be drawn to the Cross Sport variant. By comparison, it only seats five as to maintain a more coupe-like profile. Overall length is a bit shorter versus the regular Atlas, although the second row of the Cross Sport folds down to accommodate additional cargo.

2020/03/05,"Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA: Beautiful, Bold & Light","Inspired by the 1965 Giulia GTA, the new Giulia GTA is limited to 500 examples.
Based on Giulia Quadrifoglio, the new Giulia GTA uses carbon fiber extensively.
A personalized racing kit comes with each car, along with a numbered plaque.
June 24th will mark Alfa Romeo’s 110th anniversary producing cars. For the upcoming birthday celebration, Alfa Romeo debuted something that shows a return to the their origins, and pays tribute to one of their most iconic vehicles: the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA.
Light Is Right
For those that need a quick recap and Italian lesson: GTA stands for “Gran Turismo Alleggerita.” Alleggerita is Italian for lightened. And, like the fabled GTAs of the past, this new version is molto alleggerita!
The original GTAs from the 1960s were quick little monsters thanks to the profligate use of aluminum. The usage of aluminum dropped the original GTA’s weight down to around 1,900 lbs, or about 400-500 lbs. less than a current Miata. You can see the benefits already, can’t you?
Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA. Photo: Alfa Romeo.
Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA: The Full Treatment
For the new Giulia GTA, Alfa engineers tweaked the aerodynamics and handling in addition to seriously cutting weight. There are new active aerodynamics, thanks to the company’s involvement with Sauber Engineering – Alfa’s F1 racing partners –  and the use of the Sauber Aerokit. It’s hard to miss the side skirts, huge rear spoiler, and the active front splitter. The center exhaust is a titanium Akrapovic system integrated into the carbon fiber rear diffuser.
The wheels are giant, 20-inch center lock steamrollers and take advantage of the front and rear tracks being widened by 50 mm. There’s also new springs, shock absorbers, and bushings for the suspension. On the inside, you’ll find acres of Alcantara trim on the dashboard, door panels, glove compartment, side pillars, and seats.

Engine Power & Material Composition
The new Giulia GTA is powered by an all-aluminum, 2.9-liter V6 Bi-Turbo with 540 horsepower. That’s an impressive power figure, but like its 60s predecessor, the new GTA is all about lightness. This time around, there is no aluminum all over the place (aside from the engine) like they did in generations past. Although that would have been very cool and retro, Alfa is much more pragmatic about finding speed; so for 2020, they went ape with the carbon fiber. They dropped 220 lbs. by using carbon fiber for the drive shaft, hood, roof, front bumper, front wheel arches, and rear wheel arch inserts.
Related: The Enzo Ferrari years with Alfa Romeo.
They used aluminum alloy where they could, particularly in the engine, doors, and suspension. Alfa even goes so far as to use Lexan plastic in the side and rear window frames to drop the overall weight to 3,350 lbs. Yes that’s a far cry from 1965, but so are the now-mandatory safety features like door beams and airbags and all that stuff.
Photo: Alfa Romeo.
Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA: Power to Weight
When you run the numbers with the 540 horsepower the engine now cranks out, we’re talking about a power-to-weight ratio of 6.2 lbs./horsepower. Hook that to the Giulia GTA’s Launch Control system and 62 mph comes up in just 3.6 seconds. Did I mention this is a sedan? Sounds like BMW M3s and Audi S4s are going to have to settle for second place, eh?
But – and we’re just talkin’ here – say that’s not enough. Say you want more. Allow me to show you the Alfa Romeo GTAm. That little “m” stands for “modificata” and what you get is more, and, er, less. You’ll get a larger front splitter and a carbon fiber rear wing. In place of the rear seats, there’s now an Alcantara upholstered basin to hold helmets and a fire extinguisher. Oh, and it’s hard to miss that bright red roll bar where the passengers used to sit as the rear bench is gone.
There’s more carbon fiber on the GTAm, mainly in the shells of the sport seats, which also feature six-point Sabelt harnesses. I know, right? You thought you wanted the GTA, then along comes the GTAm, but either way, get in line.
Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA: Personalized Experience
The Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA and GTAm will be built in a limited run of only 500 units, all numbered and certified. If you’re one of the lucky 500, a brand ambassador and product specialist will work closely with you from order to delivery. New GTA owners will receive a personalized kit, including a Bell helmet in a special livery, a full set of Alpinestars race gear (suit, gloves, and shoes), and a personalized Goodwool cover for protecting their GTA or GTAm.
And the cherry on top? Customers get access to a specific driving course devised by the Alfa Romeo Driving Academy.

2020/03/05,Hyundai Prophecy Concept EV: Inspired By Water; Looks Like Fire!,"The Hyundai Prophecy employs a design language called Optimistic Futurism.
Design elements throughout the vehicle were inspired by water in nature.
Instead of a steering wheel, the Hyundai Prophecy uses joysticks to move.
Every automaker has a “design language,” which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a series of identifying characteristics, specific to that brand, woven into their styling and design. You might notice how vehicles of a given automaker look a “certain way.” That’s on purpose. And Hyundai’s Sensuous Sportiness is one of the best examples of this. The next phase of this design language was recently unveiled in the Prophecy Concept EV.
What Is Sensuous Sportiness?
The idea originated in Hyundai’s Le Fil Rouge concept in 2018 during the Geneva International Motor Show. The concept, with its Sensuous Sportiness design language, centered on four different but distinct traits: proportion, architecture, styling, and technology. The idea (in a nut shell) is to create a car that is aesthetically pleasing, but also one that invokes driver emotion.
Here’s something wild: Hyundai bases the Sensuous Sportiness styling on the Golden Ratio, a concept commonly found in mathematics.

What Is The Prophecy EV?
The Prophecy is an electrified and autonomous concept from Hyundai, and the next variation of the Sensuous Sportiness design language. It shares similar characteristics with the Le Fil Rouge, like the longer wheelbase and shorter overhangs. However, Hyundai says the Prophecy’s unique EV architecture allows them to go a step farther with the Sensuous Sportiness theme.
“We have brought to life yet another icon that establishes a new standard for the EV segment as well as pushing Hyundai’s design vision to even broader horizons,” explained SangYup Lee, Head of Hyundai Global Design Center. “A part of that expansion is what we call Optimistic Futurism, a design concept embodied by Prophecy.”

Hyundai Prophecy EV: Exterior Styling
Hallmarks of this Optimistic Futurism design are seen readily in the Prophecy’s side profile. Hyundai says they went for a “weathered stone” look with a “clean and simple” cut that extends from front to back. The rear quarter panels employ a boat-tail line to help give the vehicle a sense of motion, even when sitting.
Hyundai says we will see the Prophecy’s pixel lamp lights in future models.
Functional Design Language
The Hyundai Prophecy looks futuristic, but it goes beyond just that. As an EV, aerodynamics are paramount to increasing performance and overall efficiency – and the Hyundai Prophecy is no exception. With the Prophecy, air is meant to be drawn in, then flow down the side of the body; Hyundai uses the analogy of water moving over a stone.
Below the front bumper is an air intake to help cool the batteries, while a rear spoiler increases downforce.

Hyundai Prophecy EV: Interior Treatments
Designers used the Prophecy’s longer wheelbase to maximize interior space, or rather, “lifestyle space” as Hyundai calls it. Using eco-friendly materials, ambient lighting, and an overall minimalist approach, Hyundai wants occupants to feel a sense of warmth once inside. “With Optimistic Futurism, our aim is to forge an emotional connection between humans and automobiles,” Lee added.  
External intakes placed at the bottom of the side doors provide purified air inside the vehicle. In addition, the treated air is circulated back out as clean air. Like the exterior and the water over stone example, movement of air inside the cabin was also inspired by water in nature.

No Steering Wheel
In lieu of a steering wheel, joysticks control the Hyundai Prophecy. Two joysticks allow for left and right operating controls, while other joysticks are placed throughout the vehicle to handle other functions. Hyundai says these changes offer more “visual freedom” for occupants, although we do wonder what it would be like to drive every day with joysticks.
Will We Ever See The Hyundai Prophecy?
In some ways, yes. The design elements here will eventually percolate through Hyundai’s lineup. As the Prophecy is a concept, we probably won’t see it on the road like this exactly. However, in terms of body styling alone, we could see the Prophecy lending itself nicely to a future Genesis model.

2020/02/18,2020 Nissan Titan: Can Nissan Impress Loyal Truck Buyers?,"2020 Nissan Titan takes on the competition with updates for the new model year.
The Titan’s 5.6-liter V8 receives a power bump and a new nine-speed automatic.
Interior features include on-board Wi-Fi and a Fender premium audio system.
It is widely accepted that the Big Three – GM, Ford, and Ram – dominate the truck market. The Ford F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in the world for over four decades now. Not to be forgotten, the Ram 1500 surpassed the Silverado in total sales last year. Ram’s move up to number two shows how the battle between the Detroit Three is alive and well. 
So is there any room for another challenger? Particularly from a brand known for their cars and ever-expanding SUV and crossover lineup? Could the 2020 Nissan Titan make a dent in this market seemingly dominated by GM, Ford, and Ram? With this 2020 redesign, Nissan is hoping to move the needle a little further in their favor.  
What’s New With The 2020 Nissan Titan? 
Titan loyalists will recognize the 5.6-liter V8, which Nissan started using in 2015. Prior to 2020, the Titan produced 390 horsepower and 394 lb-ft. of torque. While not a drastic change, we do see an increase to 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft. of torque. Nissan did, however, swap their seven-speed automatic for a new nine-speed unit. Nissan’s thought process here is faster and smoother acceleration and better fuel economy. 
Whether the 2020 Titan holds up to these claims remains to be determined. The extra boost will be great, however, especially for truck owners who inevitably get asked by their friends to help them move.

A Further Look At The 2020 Titan Engine 
The 2020 Titan employs Variable Valve Event & Lift (VVEL). Nissan’s setup combines hydraulic-controlled variable valve timing and electronically-controlled variable valve lift. The combination allows for better overall performance and efficiency during a wide range of driving – be it off-road adventures or casual Sunday cruising.
Nissan buyers looking to move from a sedan (like the Altima) or smaller SUV (like the Rogue) may be concerned about the difference in fuel economy. While there certainly will be a difference, VVEL will provide some fuel economy benefits for the Titan.

How Much Can The 2020 Nissan Titan Tow?
When properly equipped, the 2020 Nissan Titan Crew Cab can tow 9,350 lbs. (4×2) and 9,210 lbs. (4×4). Max payload for a Titan Crew Cab, when properly equipped, is 1,580 lbs. (4×2) and 1,680 lbs. (4×4).

4×4 System & Off-Road Overview 
We Michanganders are familiar with snow and ice, so trucks like the Nissan Titan hold a certain appeal. Those who regularly encounter dirt and mud likely have the same appreciation. With the Off-Road Gauge, drivers see information on tire angle, and relative pitch and roll angles. Without using a gyroscope, Nissan developed a new method to calculate the vehicle’s orientation using accelerometer data and the vehicle’s current G-force.
To assist with various off-road activities, Nissan also equipped the Pro-4X variant with Hill Descent Control. The 2020 Nissan Titan is also equipped with an electronic-locking, limited-slip differential for added traction. 
2020 Nissan Titan Pro-4X. Photo: Nissan North America.
Exterior Design
The Titian’s solid beam construction houses LED headlights across the board. Those out at night, off-roading or working late, will appreciate being able to see in the bed of their Titan. Four LED-lights now illuminate the pickup bed so loading tools or furniture, or just trying to find something among your gear (mess) is no longer impossible.  
When using the brights, High Beam Assist recognizes approaching drivers and dims down so as not to blind them. The similarities start to narrow down as you get into the different trim levels. Each of the three – PRO-4X, SL, and Platinum Reserve – get a grille design unique to their truck. Between those three trucks, nine colors are available but, similarly, it will vary depending on the trim level you choose.

Interior Technology  
Most of the time spent with your truck is in the driver’s seat, and Nissan seems to get that. Zero Gravity seats, heated or cooled, provide additional bolstering, while Apple CarPlay and Android Auto provide additional connectivity. The 2020 Titan’s voice control capability makes for some pretty cool handsfree tech. You’re just a “Hey Siri” or “Okay, Google” away from maps or songs, all framed by the standard eight-inch screen (nine-inch available). 
An upgrade away is the Fender 12-speaker audio system with a nine-channel amplifier. As music people, we think cruising down the highway listening to some chill jams is well deserved after a long day. On-board Wi-fi supports up to six devices (subscription required) so you can utilize that Fender system while camping or tailgating.

Upgraded Safety Features
The 2020 Nissan Titan is equipped with Safety Shield 360. The comprehensive list includes: Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection; Blind Spot Warning; Rear Cross Traffic Alert; Lane Departure Warning; High Beam Assist; and Rear Automatic Braking. Nissan also developed Rear Door Alert to beep when a driver walks away and leaves something in the backseat.   
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Nissan Titan is available now. The truck comes in three King Cab trims: S, SV, and PRO-4X; and five Crew Cab grades: S, SV, SL, Platinum Reserve, and PRO-4X. The new Titan is available in 4×2 and 4×4 configurations, although the PRO-4X is 4×4 only.
The 2020 Nissan Titan starts at $36,190 (King Cab 4×2), going as high as $58,690 for the Platinum Reserve Crew Cab 4×4. Add on another $1,595 for destination.

2020/02/17,Aston Martin Vantage Roadster: This Drop Top Looks Really Fun!,"Aston Martin Vantage Roadster is powered by a twin-turbo V8.
Special fabric top lowers quickly and stows away seamlessly.
Deliveries of the Vantage Roadster are expected this spring.
Aston Martin has just rolled out a new Vantage Roadster to join the Coupe in Aston’s most driver-focused model line. Propelled by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, and mated to an eight-speed ZF transmission, the drop top is quick enough to sprint to 60 in 3.7 seconds. And that’s not the only fast thing it does. The Vantage Roadster can go from top up to top down in less than seven seconds.
Honestly, when I first saw pictures of this thing, I thought it was a Ferrari Portofino. That’s not a bad thing. The Portofino is a very attractive car, as is the Vantage. And I suppose both of them are aimed at the same sort of buyer; it’s fast enough but it has tons of style.
Aston Martin Vantage Roadster Specs
The performance that the Vantage Roadster is capable of throwing down is largely thanks to that 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. The engine, with dual variable camshaft timing and water-to-air charge cooling, cranks out 503 ponies and 505 lb-ft. of torque with a top speed of 190. They don’t say if that vMax is with the top up (I expect it is), but I’m sure doing nearly the double ton with the top down is an experience.
Yes, it has a rear mid-mounted, eight-speed ZF automatic to handle the ratios, but you won’t notice the lack of shifting when you’re cruising down The Esplanade, basking in those admiring stares.
It turns out, the convertible soft top only adds around 125 lbs. over the Vantage Coupe, thanks to a lighter Z-fold roof mechanism and other exterior and chassis revisions. Aston Martin says the Roadster is just as rigid as the Coupe, but I’ll believe that when I see it.

Suspension & Chassis Tools
The new Vantage Roadster has an independent double wishbone design, with coil springs and an anti-roll bar at the front. Out back, there are multi-link coil springs and another anti-roll bar.
Like the Vantage Coupe, the Roadster also makes use of Adaptive Damping, Dynamic Stability Control, Dynamic Torque Vectoring, and an Electronic Rear Differential – each of which are Aston Martin hallmarks. The difference is that the Roadster has specifically-tuned rear dampers (shocks), and special adaptive damping software and ESP calibration. The Sport, Sport + and Track chassis modes were also tuned specifically for the Roadster.
Related: Here is what Aston Martin’s Project 003 really was all along!
Drop The Top!
Now, about that fabric convertible top. The compact-powered, Z-fold mechanism means it can lower in 6.7 seconds (or be raised in 6.8). It also has the really cool feature of being able to go up or down while you’re moving at speeds of up to 31 mph. Aston crows that this is the fastest, full-operating cycle of any automatic convertible system. And I think they’re right. The previous record holder was the old Ferrari Superamerica with that glass roof that could go up or down in nine flat.

Low Stack Height
Also, the folding mechanism makes for a very low “stack height.” That’s how tall the folded package is when it’s as mushed up as possible. If a designer works it right, you can’t even tell there is a folded roof down in there. If not, you get a big mass of wadded fabric like on a VW Beetle Convertible. At any rate, the Aston’s folded top not only creates a seamless rear profile, it also has minimal impact on the Roadster’s luggage space. The trunk is big enough (200 liters according to Aston Martin) to hold a full-size golf bag and accessories.
Pricing & Availability
The Aston Martin Vantage Roadster starts at $161,000, which is about $50k less than a Portofino (if you’re price conscious). Deliveries of the Vantage Roadster are expected this spring.

2020/02/15,AutoSens Detroit 2020: Top Autonomous Driving Conference Returns To The U.S.,"Update: 3-18-2020: AutoSens Detroit postponed until November amid Coronavirus outbreak.
Organizers for AutoSens Detroit are gearing up for their most expansive North American event to date. AutoSens is a three-day workshop, conference, and exhibition focused on the challenges facing autonomous cars at nearly every level, from the supply chain to research and development. With yearly events in Brussels, Detroit and now Hong Kong, AutoSens gathers engineers, researchers, and other industry professionals under one roof to examine the full scope of automated driving.
“The discussions at the conference revolve around numerous vehicle perception technologies,” explained Robert Stead, Managing Director, Sense Media Group, the parent company of AutoSens. “By this we mean the sensors, cables, processors, and other hardware and software that give a vehicle’s computer a picture of its environment. We also cover the wider issues, which might include the regulatory, financial, or legal context for the development of vehicle perception systems.”
AutoSens Detroit returns to the Michigan Science Center beginning on May 12th. Here is a look at this year’s agenda in the Motor City.
In Pursuit of Good Science
Organizers structure AutoSens as a learning experience for engineers and other automotive professionals. The academic and technical aspects remain at the forefront, with the upcoming Detroit conference offering a number of different sessions, forums, in-depth tutorials, and a healthy showcase of cutting-edge automotive technology. Stead says AutoSens is the place where engineers can “take off the boxing gloves” as they examine the technical hurdles facing autonomous cars.
“The latest autonomous vehicles have a truly futuristic level of functionality, and some of the greatest engineering minds in the world are working on these topics to improve and augment ADAS capabilities,” Stead continued. “But there is still a long way to go before people all over the world are riding to work or to see family in an autonomous vehicle. The technical challenges are immense – dealing with edge case road scenarios, adverse weather conditions, interactions with human pedestrians and drivers, addressing motion sickness, and a host of other challenges.”
AutoSens Detroit will feature an additional technical track this year centered on deep learning, sensor fusion, and validation and calibration among other things. Attendees will also see new developments concerning in-cabin monitoring, radar, LiDAR, and a number of other image sensing technologies.
“AutoSens attendees are the actual engineers who are building the systems that will make it all possible,” Stead said. “You’ll find the attendees, even if they are doing research on a niche technical area, will be very open to explain what it’s all about.”

AutoSens Detroit 2020: Expert Speakers
The program for May includes four keynote sessions and over 60 expert speakers, each lending their expertise and experience on a wide range of topics. “We record all the presentations as well, so they are available for attendees afterwards,” Stead said. “We always want a high quality of technical presentations at AutoSens every year, so all attendees will go back to their office or lab with some new solutions, food for thought, or novel information.”
Among the speakers are Puneet Sinha, Director of New Mobility for Siemens Digital Industries Software, the lead sponsor of AutoSens Detroit 2020. Sinha will speak on the challenges within the supply chain for autonomous vehicles. Dr. Ray Ptucha, Associate Professor and Director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology, will discuss how deep learning relates to autonomy. Alexander Schaab, Vice President of Autonomous Driving at Mercedes-Benz R&D, will address the path from Level 2 to Level 5 autonomy.
Back by popular demand is longtime AutoSens presenter Rudy Burger, Managing Partner of Woodside Capital Partners. Burger will give an update on the latest M&A and venture capital activities as they concern autonomous driving. “We’re seeing capital now getting invested in smaller and smaller companies as the market and investors decide who the winners and losers are going to be,” Burger said on stage at AutoSens Brussels in September. “It’s fascinating to see how the amount of capital a company raises, and who they raise it from, can have a significant impact on if they become a market winner.”

An Emphasis On Cybersecurity
One of the highlights at AutoSens Detroit this year is a plenary session on the importance of cybersecurity. Experts on the panel include Kristie Pfosi, Automotive Cybersecurity Senior Manager, Mitsubishi; Cassie Clark, Senior Security Awareness Program Manager, Cruise; and Vicki Kamenova, Partner & Cybersecurity Leader, EY Americas. The panel is moderated by Jennifer Tisdale, Associate Principal, Embedded Systems & Advanced Transportation Security, GRIMM.
“Cybersecurity is different than safety because we cannot guarantee it’s going to be a forever fix, especially with automotive,” Tisdale said. “There is always going to be another vulnerability and we need to be vigilant. The challenge is getting the literal buy-in. We need the budget from senior leadership to invest in the testing so we can better develop the tools to ensure security.”
Other plenary sessions in Detroit will focus on how China will play a role in autonomous vehicle technology, and how those in the industry can promote innovation through regulation and public safety initiatives. Additional sessions will address high level views on how far the industry is, scientifically and realistically, from fully autonomous cars.
“Presentations will focus on identification of the flaws and shortcomings in current technological solutions, encouraging the audience and industry to engage in a discussion of what these remaining challenges are,” Stead said.

New Thought Leaders Descend On Detroit
50 plus exhibitors, including those new to the conference, will be on hand for AutoSens Detroit to showcase their technology and innovations. Pony.ai is attending for the first time to discuss new trends in image processing and camera effectiveness for automotive applications. Also new to AutoSens is Zoox, who will be talking about functional and active safety alongside MSC Software, FCA, and Zenuity. To provide context on the current performance of pedestrian detection systems, AAA will present findings from their large body of research.
“AutoSens exhibitors offer tremendous insight into what is happening at the ground level in this industry,” explained Carl Anthony, Automoblog’s Managing Editor and host of AutoSens TV. “They are developing, designing, and testing the very products and solutions that will make autonomous driving a reality one day.”
“AutoSens is great because it’s small enough so you actually get to know people,” said Junko Yoshida, Global Co-Editor-in-Chief, EE Times. “It goes beyond exchanging business cards; you actually get to talk and exchange ideas.”

Tickets, Location & More Information
AutoSens Detroit 2020 begins on Tuesday, May 12th at the Michigan Science Center and runs through the 14th. One thing we recommend are the track demos, a signature of every AutoSens Detroit conference. This year, they begin on that Tuesday, May 12th, and run from 3pm onward. The track demos give attendees the chance to see and experience a number of different vehicle perception technologies firsthand.
The full agenda for this year can be found here, along with the full list of speakers. Tickets, including discount packages for females in the engineering community, are available now.
“The vision has always been about community,” Stead added. “Conversations and collaborations are what drives the success of AutoSens, and will be the signature ingredient at all our events for years to come.”

2020/02/12,2020 Audi Q5: New Plug-In Hybrid Option Now Available,"A plug-in hybrid option is now available for the 2020 Audi Q5.
The new TFSI e powertrain delivers 369 lb-ft. of torque.
Even the adaptive cruise control has green features.
For 2020, Audi has introduced the first plug-in hybrid version of its Q5 SUV. Not only is the Q5 the sensible choice – the Q7 is kinda big, the Q3 is kinda small – the Q5 is just right. And now it’s the much more environmentally conscious choice. The new PHEV powertrain combined with standard quattro all-wheel drive and SUV practicality give the 2020 Q5 some serious advantages.
Before we get to nitty-gritty of this new drivetrain, it’s worth noting the Q5 is Audi’s best-selling SUV. Like I said, it hits a sweet spot. The Q3 is nice, but it’s a bit on the small side, and the Q7 is great, but it’s a tank. The Q5 is enough if you have a family, but it’s still not too much to try and drive around town.
Audi Q5: What’s New For 2020?
The big news for 2020 is this TFSI e drivetrain. The traditional bit is the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder TFSI engine. That’s now hooked to an electric motor that lives between the engine and seven-speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic. Combined output is 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. That’s a healthy amount, and it adds up to better performance versus the non-hybrid Q5.
With the TFSI e, the sprint from zero to 60 mph takes only five seconds, nearly a second faster than the normal Q5.

2020 Audi Q5 TFSI e: Drive Modes
If you’re more into economy than all-out performance, the Audi Q5 TFSI e allows you to adjust engine and battery usage with three modes: Hybrid, EV, and Battery Hold.
Hybrid Mode is activated automatically by on-board route guidance in the MMI navigation system. It optimizes battery power over a given route to reduce fuel, factoring in things like the speed limit, types of roads, and any data from the vehicle’s sensors. In EV Mode, the Q5 moves exclusively on battery power as long as you don’t mash the “gas” past its limit. In Battery Hold Mode, battery capacity is held at the current level in case you anticipate a need for it later on.

What Is The Range of the Audi Q5 TFSI e?
In electric-only mode, the Audi Q5 TFSI e has a range of 20 miles using its 14.1 kWh lithium-ion battery. Electric-only mode is great for around town driving, urban situations, and the like. The 2020 Audi Q5 TFSI e is EPA rated at 65 MPGe.
The Q5 TFSI e comes standard with a compact charging system with cables for home or on the go. The myAudi app shows how long until fully charged.

Predictive Energy Assist: How It Works
Audi was clever about packaging, locating the lithium-ion battery pack under the luggage compartment floor. Another trick efficiency measure is the climate control system with a heat pump that pools otherwise wasted heat from various high-voltage components.
Another contributor to overall efficiency is the adaptive cruise control. Audi uses something called “predictive efficiency assist,” which adjusts the electric and gasoline motor to increase range and fuel economy.
The system also works even if you’re not using adaptive cruise control. If that is the case, a haptic signal from the accelerator and a visual signal in the cockpit and heads-up display will alert the driver to the proper times to let off the gas. Audi says such a feature allows owners to use as much kinetic energy as possible.

Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Audi Q5 TFSI e comes in three trim levels: Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige. Prices are quite reasonable, given not just the usual Audi build quality but also the amount of green tech. The Premium lists for $52,900, Premium Plus for $56,600, and the top-of-the-line Prestige for $60,350. Add in another $995 for destination.

2020/02/11,2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid: New King of Hybrid Sedans?,"Against the competition, the 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid makes a strong case.
In the more efficient Blue trim, the Sonata Hybrid returns 54 mpg on the highway.
The car is equipped with numerous tech features, including integrated solar panels.
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid was officially unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show recently. Obviously, it’s a semi-electric version of the eighth-generation Sonata, but it doesn’t look like a hybrid at all, does it? Granted the smaller wheels are a bit of a turnoff, but at least you get a smoother, quieter, and comfier ride – which are hallmarks of a modern hybrid sedan.
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is possibly the new king of hybrid sedans, and I say this with the Toyota Camry Hybrid and Honda Accord Hybrid firmly affixed in my line of sight. Hyundai had the pleasure of arriving late to the party, and it had all the time in the world to make it right.
Solar Panels? Why Not!
With so much information and content vying for our precious attention, new products need an edge, or at least something unique to set them apart from the rest. In the case of the 2020 Sonata Hybrid, the standout feature has to be that glorious full-width solar panel roof. Yes, we’re talking about solar panels that convert light from the sun into electrical energy, but no, the 2020 Sonata Hybrid is NOT a solar-powered car.
Hyundai calls their setup the Solar Roof System (SRS), and it’s purported to give up to 700 “free” miles of range per year, given enough sun exposure. According to Hyundai, the SRS has an electrical output of 205 watts and is directly wired to charge the 12-volt system and hybrid batteries. With this solar roof setup, you have enough juice for around 2.2 miles per day. The system also prevents battery discharge by feeding power to the HVAC and infotainment systems when the engine is off.

One Slight Caveat
However, there’s a catch. Most of the magic happens if the solar panels are exposed to direct sunlight for at least six hours – which is fine on those long road trips. But shorter trips around the city? Driving at night? Not so much. Is it worth the added cost and complexity over a conventional roof? Hard to say. But it’s there nevertheless, and it’s still a feature worth discussing. It should be noted not everybody is convinced this is the right move on Hyundai’s part either.
2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid: Engine & Drivetrain
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine with direct injection. It provides 150 horsepower and 139 lb-ft. of torque. It also has a single 39 kW electric motor churning out an additional 51 horsepower and 151 lb-ft. of torque for a combined system output of 192 horsepower.
The engine is mated to an innovative Active Shift Control (ASC) six-speed automatic gearbox. Hyundai’s hybrid ASC transmission is equipped with a new shift logic control system. It works by constantly monitoring the engine and transmission as you drive, at a rate of 500 times per second. In fact, Hyundai was able to reduce shift times to 350 milliseconds from 500 milliseconds. And if you think about it, this new six-speed gearbox is just as fast as a dual-clutch transmission while being smaller, smoother, and less complicated than a conventional DCT.
“The development of the world’s first ASC technology is a remarkable innovation that incorporates precise motor control to an automatic transmission,” explained KyoungJoon Chang, Vice President and Head of Powertrain Control System Group, Hyundai Motor Group. “It will not only save fuel but also provide a more fun driving experience for our customers.”

Power Output Versus The Competition
It all sounds glorious, right? Hold your horses. Despite having a combined 192 horsepower output, the 2020 Hyundai Sonata is not exactly a nuclear powerhouse. By comparison, the 2020 Toyota Camry Hybrid is good for 212 horsepower while Honda’s Accord Hybrid is good for 208 horsepower. While more power is (generally) always good for a hybrid, there’s a big reason why the new Sonata Hybrid is still king despite the lack of brute force.
Related: What does a Hyundai warranty really cover?
Fuel Economy Versus The Competition
The 2020 Sonata Hybrid may be short on power compared to its rivals, but it goes farther than anything you can shake a stick at. In the Sonata Hybrid Blue trim (the most efficient model in the lineup), Hyundai’s king hybrid achieves 54 mpg on the highway. Meanwhile, the Sonata Hybrid SEL and Limited are good for 45/51 city/highway and 47 combined mpg.
With active air flaps behind the grille; underbody cladding to reduce drag; and a redesigned rear spoiler, the Sonata Hybrid has a 0.24 drag coefficient – brilliant numbers for a midsize family sedan. All of these design cues help boost fuel economy.
In our opinion, the Sonata Hybrid Blue is the new king of hybrid parsimony. The chart below compares the Sonata Hybrid’s fuel economy against the Accord and Camry Hybrids.
Fuel Economy Comparison

Camry Hybrid LE 51 53 52
Camry Hybrid SE & XLE 44 47 46
Accord Hybrid 48 47 48
Interior Space Versus The Competition
In terms of cabin and storage room, Hyundai engineers went the extra mile by optimizing the battery’s position. The result is an increase in trunk capacity by 2.5 cubic feet compared to the previous model, along with best-in-class front headroom and legroom compared to the Camry and Accord Hybrids.
However, we’re wondering why the Camry and Accord offer better rear legroom (38 and 40.4 inches, respectively) than the new Sonata Hybrid (34.8 inches) despite these changes. This is not exactly a deal breaker, but it’s an important thing to consider if you savor the feeling of lounging in the back seats.

Interior Technology
Being the king of hybrids also means having the latest tech wizardry. Top-end models of the Sonata Hybrid have a 10.25-inch center touchscreen with split-screen capabilities, and cloud-based speech recognition courtesy of Hyundai’s Blue Link system. Standard models get a smaller eight-inch audio display. Meanwhile, occupants get to stare at a new 12.3-inch digital instrument display.
Also on the standard equipment list: an electric parking brake; Qi high-speed wireless charging; Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; Text-to-Speech via Bluetooth; and heated and ventilated front seats.
Standard Safety Technology
SmartSense is Hyundai’s comprehensive array of advanced driver assistance systems. In total, the 2020 Sonata Hybrid is festooned with three radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors. Safety features include forward collision avoidance assist; rear cross-traffic collision; blind-spot collision avoidance; lane-keeping assist; and advanced cruise control with stop and go.

Pleasant Styling Features
We like how the hybrid version pretty much resembles the standard Sonata, albeit with a few differences. In addition to the smaller wheels, the new Sonata Hybrid also inherits the Korean-spec grille not found on the standard Sonata models. Other than that, it essentially has the aerodynamic fastback profile of the new Sonata along with those groovy daytime running lights in the front and C-shaped LED taillights in the back.
Hyundai also added a number of sound-deadening elements as well. The list includes new and improved carpeting; double-junction soundproof glass for the front doors and windshield; and thicker sound absorption materials for the wheel guards, trunk bottom, and door trim.
2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid: Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is set to go on sale this spring. Pricing has not been announced yet, although the 2019 Sonata Hybrid SE starts at $23,750.

2020/02/11,Mercedes-Benz Weekender: Bring On That Wild Country!,"The Mercedes-Benz Weekender is a pop-up camper van for the U.S. market.
Riding on the Metris platform, the Weekender seats five and sleeps for four.
Despite modern features, the Weekender reminds us of the glory days of vans.
Mercedes-Benz announced its first modern and practical pop-up camper van for the U.S. market at the Chicago Auto Show recently. Mercedes drew inspiration from previous camper models, but integrated the latest safety and convenience features. Put it another way: This is not a hippie van. No. This a very well-appointed Mercedes you can go camping in.
It Just So Happens . . .
By the strangest of coincidences I saw one of these things yesterday. I live next to an apple cidery and as I was walking through the parking lot, a big, black Mercedes Sprinter van came pulling in. It was all the stuff hanging off it that first drew my attention. From all the light racks and roof racks, it looked like there was tons of intense customization going on. I didn’t see the license plate, but I assumed they were down from Canada since Merc doesn’t import these things into America, until now.
The couple that got out looked like models in the REI catalog: mid-20s, fit, outdoorsy, rich. The perfect demographic for the new camper that Mercedes is unleashing into the wilds of America.
Incense & Peppermints
This new Mercedes-Benz for the great American vacation is called the Weekender, and it rides on the Metris van platform (unlike the outgoing world-market Sprinter). The Weekender camper is built by Driverge Vehicle Innovations in partnership with Peace Vans, one of the largest classic camper van repair and restoration shops in the United States. Yeah, I know, that’s kind of hippie-dippie tree hugger stuff, but, c’mon, we’re dealing with pop-top camper vans here. We couldn’t get through this with out some patchouli being involved.

Into The Wild
Anyway, Mercedes, Driverge, and Peace Vans have made a vehicle that is very adaptable. The Weekender can be used on extended road trips; taking the family on summer vacations or spring breaks; camping out in national parks; impromptu weekend explorations; or having a comfortable place to work or relax after an all day surf session. The pop-up camper gives you flexibility, while the Metris van platform is not-too-big, so you can deal with major metropolitan areas, city parking spots, garages, and narrow driveways.
Mercedes-Benz Weekender: Standard Equipment
The list of standard features found in the Weekender is impressive. For starters, there’s the roof, which is in the tried and true pop-top layout. Elevate the roof and not only can you stand up, but there’s a sleeping area for two with an integrated spring system, a two-inch memory foam mattress, three windows, and extra USB ports for charging all that modern stuff we still need out in nature.
There’s also a multipurpose rear bench seat that opens into a bed for two. Another neat trick about the back seat is that it can move along a rail into one of four locations, so you can haul both people and cargo more easily.
The front seats can rotate 180 degrees, so your Weekender can become “the perfect multipurpose lounge.” There’s also a second battery to power your devices as well as handling more traditional stuff, like lighting the campsite around you.
Plenty of Really Cool Extras
And check out the factory options. There’s built-in solar charging capability thanks to the integrated solar panels, and audio and navigation upgrades to improve your road trip experience. There are various personalization options with 3M auto body wraps, which allow the Weekender to come in any one of 200 available colors.
As for camping, no worries there. An awning is available for sun and rain protection, along with mosquito and bug screens for the rear hatch and sliding doors. Also (and get this), there is a tent that quickly attaches to the rear lift gate for added space and privacy. I will let you use your imagination on that one. There are also roof racks for hauling surfboards, extra gear or skis, and (get this!) a pullout rear kitchen.
Mercedes-Benz weekender with the available awning.
A New Generation
As a vehicle, any worries are utterly unfounded. This is not 1967 and you’re not driving around in a VW Type 2 converted by Wavy Gravy. Since the Weekender rides on a Mercedes Metris platform, build quality and reliability is almost a given. Service intervals happen every 15,000 miles in some cases; the fuel economy is impressive for something this big (it comes with start/stop); and the tow rating is a healthy 5,000 lbs.
There’s standard Crosswind Assist to stabilize the van if it’s really windy, and there’s load-adaptive ESP that automatically stabilizes the vehicle if wheel spin, or understeer and oversteer is detected.
Mercedes-Benz Weekender: Availability
You want one, don’t you? Shoot, Merc will be selling these things like hot cakes around here. People are crazy about camping in the Pacific Northwest. I, however, am not one of them, but I can see why a number of my deluded friends will covet the Weekender. As if the van itself isn’t enough, Mercedes-Benz will give the first 100 customers a free National Parks Pass.
If this sounds like the camper of your dreams, then know that you can order the Weekender from any authorized Mercedes-Benz Van dealer nationwide starting this spring.

2020/02/09,2020 Honda Civic Type R: Same Boy Racer Vibe But Better Than Before,"The 2020 Honda Civic Type R is the Civic to end all Civics.
Under the hood is a 2.0-liter VTEC turbo with 306 horsepower.
Honda also upgraded the braking and suspension components.
The 2020 Honda Civic Type R was unveiled recently at the Chicago Auto Show. Apparently, it has the same boy racer vibe as before. Large rear spoiler? Check. How about vents, scoops, and aero bits? Check; check; and check. Mind you, we’re not complaining at all. If you want a bonkers Civic, the Type R is the one to get. And if you can get past the rebellious façade, you’ll easily fall in love with the Type R’s endearing driving performance.
We’re not talking about an all-new model here, but the changes are extensive enough to warrant a closer look. It’s important to point out the new Type R was officially revealed last month at the Tokyo Auto Show, so we already knew about the transmogrifications. But during its U.S. debut in Chicago, the new Type R was basking in the full glory of its Boost Blue paint – the color of which is exclusive to the Type R.
Now, I don’t know about you, but the Type R’s new blue paint is astonishing.
2020 Honda Civic Type R: What’s New?
The 2020 Honda Civic Type R benefits from a new front grille. It now has a 13-percent larger opening to offer better engine cooling. Honda also reshaped the front and rear bumpers and gave both some body-colored accents. The front also has a redesigned front spoiler resting neatly under the bumper. It now has ribbed sections on each end to improve downforce as you scamper like a frightened cat in your Civic Type R. The larger grille was enough to somehow give the Type R a cleaner, more dignified face, but Honda basically kept the exterior as is, which is a good call if you’ll ask us.
Meanwhile, the biggest changes are hidden from plain view. For example, the new Type R has stiffer rear bushings and new dampers to deliver a cushier ride, which is the antithesis of a performance car. But since the Type R is for the street, it wouldn’t hurt if Honda gave it a more compliant set of shock absorbers, right? Meanwhile, Honda also updated the software for the adaptive dampers. It can now read the road surface 10 times faster than in the previous model. According to Honda, those lightning-quick dampers are responsible for better handling or ride comfort when you need it most.
Apparently, Honda also tinkered with the front suspension and steering components. This includes updated compliance bushings (which are 10 percent stiffer longitudinally) and lower-friction balljoints to deliver razor-sharp steering. Together with stiffer rear bushings in the lower B-arm, Honda ensured us the changes were necessary to improve the new Type R’s agility. The 2020 Type R is also home to a new pair of lighter two-piece brake rotors (which saves 5 pounds of weight) with upgraded pads which, according to Honda, reduce fade while improving braking performance at higher speeds.

Sporty & Refined Interior
Honda was kind enough to update the 2020 Type R’s interior as well. The car now has a new steering wheel wrapped in genuine Alcantara; a new shifter with shorter throws (which remains one of the best and smoothest manual gearboxes in the business); and a new shift knob.
Also new for 2020 is Honda’s Active Sound Control system. I don’t speak for everybody here at Automoblog, but I think anything that produces fake engine sounds should be banned through eternity. Honda’s system modifies the sound according to your chosen drive mode (Comfort, Sport, and +R), but honestly, who needs it?

What Engine Does The Civic Type R Have?
Fast Hondas are all about the motor, and this one is no different as the Type R’s engine is unchanged for 2020. This means a race-bred and direct-injected, 2.0-liter VTEC turbo four-banger churning out 306 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque. EPA ratings come in at 22/28 city/highway and 25 combined.
Related: Extended warranty options to help protect your beloved Honda.
The engine is connected to a six-speed manual gearbox which feels like it’s made of premium Lurpak butter, unicorn hair, and Guimara’s mangoes. Yeah, the gearbox is that good. Honda always knew how to make a stick feel absolutely on point. Power is fed to the front wheels and is governed by a standard limited-slip differential.
Standard Honda Sensing
For the first time ever, Honda Sensing is now standard in the 2020 Civic Type R. This also marks the first time Honda Sensing is standard across the entire Civic lineup – including the 2020 Honda Civic Si. The comprehensive suite of advanced safety features includes adaptive cruise control; lane-keeping assist; lane departure warning; road departure mitigation; and collision mitigation braking.

Performance Data Logger
For the first time ever in a Honda, the 2020 Civic Type R will come with Honda LogR. It’s a new data logger which allows the vehicle’s onboard computer and sensors to communicate with a smartphone app. This feature is exclusive to the new Type R and is good news for Honda fans who can’t resist tinkering with their rides. Honda LogR is a performance monitor; data logger; and performance driving coach in a single app. It works in both Android and Apple smartphones and is compatible to all 2020 and newer Type R models.
2020 Honda Civic Type R: Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Honda Civic Type R will be available beginning on February 28th. Starting MSRP is $37,950, which includes the destination charge of $955.

2020/02/08,2020 Kia Cadenza: An Overlooked & Slightly Unconventional Crown Jewel,"The 2020 Kia Cadenza receives a number of interior design updates.
Technology and safety features are numerous, although not overdone.
Buyers may find the Cadenza a nice change of pace versus other sedans.
The Kia Cadenza is sleek but not over the top; it’s stylish but not obnoxious; and has more going for it than some might realize. Car buyers looking for something beyond the “typical luxury sedan” may be pleasantly surprised by the Cadenza, especially for 2020. The refreshed 2020 Kia Cadenza landed at the Chicago Auto Show earlier this week with a number of solid updates.
What Is The Kia Cadenza?
The Cadenza is Kia’s large sedan and a step up in terms of size from the Optima. It competes with other bigger cars like the Toyota Avalon, Nissan Maxima, and Chevy Impala. Kia also markets the Cadenza to a demographic who want something nice and a little bigger, but don’t necessarily need an SUV or crossover.
“The Cadenza continues to introduce new and luxury-minded customers to the Kia brand,” explained Michael Cole, Kia Motors America President. “We recognize there are many customers who don’t want or need an SUV, but still desire a vehicle with plentiful interior room and a large trunk.”
Related: More younger buyers today are expressing an interest in sedans.
2020 Kia Cadenza: What’s New?
Kia spent a lot of time on the interior, improving the cabin’s overall layout and ergonomics. The dash and instrument cluster are entirely new, and the audio controls are now positioned above the climate switchgear. Two new Nappa leather seat colors are available: Saddle Brown and Gray. Limited models offer quilted bolsters for extra comfort.
On the outside, the 2020 Kia Cadenza sports a new hood and grille, with a fascia design the automaker calls a “vertical waterfall.” Standard now are LED headlights, LED daytime running lamps, and LED rear taillights. 18-inch wheels are standard although 19-inch ones are available.

2020 Kia Cadenza: Under The Hood
The 3.3-liter V6 returns from last year and delivers a healthy 290 horsepower and 253 lb-ft. of torque. Kia makes use of aluminum for the block and heads to help reduce weight and increase efficiency. EPA fuel economy ratings for the new Cadenza are 20/28 city/highway and 23 combined. Unleaded fuel is fine for the 18.5 gallon tank.
Power is sent to the front-wheels via an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is not available for the 2020 Kia Cadenza.
Related: The new Kia Soul GT-Line is the jolt your daily commute needs!
Essential Foundations
The Cadenza’s architecture is a steel unibody, a construction type with numerous benefits, from safety to fuel economy. NVH reductions (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) come by way of reinforced rear sub-frame cross members. Kia says the redesigned shock valves also help reduce vibration, with the larger rear dampers improving rebound over rougher surfaces. In short, the 2020 Kia Cadenza should feel smoother than a comparable 2019 model.

Technology & Safety
The 2020 Kia Cadenza has plenty to go around, starting with the new 12.3-inch touchscreen with Bluetooth connectivity. Three USB charging ports, one for the front passenger and two in the backseat, compliment the 10-watt wireless phone charger. Limited models have the option for multi-color LED ambient lighting. Perfect for date night. I would drive the Cadenza on a date.
And her family will approve because there are a ton of safety features! The 2020 Cadenza comes with Kia’s Drive Wise package, which includes Forward Collision Warning; Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (with pedestrian and cyclist detection); Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go; and High Beam Assist. The Safe Exit Assist feature alerts occupants if they are unknowingly opening the door into oncoming traffic.

Pricing & Availability
When it goes on sale later this year, the 2020 Cadenza will be available in two trims: Technology and Limited. The Premium trim is no longer available. Kia says pricing will be announced in the near future, closer to the on-sale date. The 2019 Cadenza starts at $33,100, and a slight bump up is likely for 2020.

2020/02/08,2021 VW Atlas: Quick But Detailed Overview,"2021 VW Atlas seats seven and has a long list of available features.
The on-board Wi-FI hotspot will accommodate up to four devices.
When properly equipped, the new Atlas can tow up to 5,000 lbs.
Volkswagen unveiled the face-lifted 2021 Atlas SUV at the Chicago Auto Show this week. The refreshed seven-seater presents a number of interior upgrades, advanced technologies, and new driver-assistance features. And now both the V6 and four-cylinder engines are available with 4Motion all-wheel drive.
What Is The 2021 VW Atlas?
A little while back, I wrote about the VW Atlas Cross Sport. The SUV we have here is essentially the “normal” version of that. It has no leaning towards sportiness (other than what they could squeeze out of the drivetrain), and is all about everyday practicality. The 2021 Volkswagen Atlas is what it is: big, boxy, but very user friendly.
Under all that sheet metal, the Atlas is largely the same as the outgoing model, but thanks to new front and rear bumper designs, it’s nearly three inches longer for 2021. It also gets the same grille and headlights as the Atlas Cross Sport as well as standard LED lighting. Opting for the R-line trim will get you unique bumpers, side skirts, and big 20- or 21-inch aluminum-alloy wheels along with signature R-line badging.

What Engine Does The 2021 VW Atlas Have?
There are two powertrains on offer for the 2021 Atlas. There’s a 276-horsepower V6 and a 235-horsepower turbo four-cylinder with direct injection. Either engine is mated to an eight-speed automatic and both are available with Volkswagen’s 4Motion all-wheel drive system. Pairing the little 2.0-liter with 4Motion is new for the 2021 model year. It’s not a bad engine choice, if what you’re aiming to do is drive around town and not haul a lot of people and stuff. Plus, the all-wheel drive will give you extra security when winter comes around.
If you are aiming to haul more stuff around, the V6 version can tow up to 5,000 lbs. when properly equipped.
Related: A fast look at the new features and updates for the 2020 VW lineup.
Premium Audio & Wi-Fi Hotspots
Of course the interior gets a refresh and upgrades over the outgoing model. There’s a new steering wheel, available contrast-stitching for the leather seats and door trim, and an eight-inch Composition Media infotainment system. There is also the Volkswagen Digital Cockpit; a Fender (as in the guitars) Premium Audio System; trick ambient lighting; a three-zone Climatronic HVAC system; ventilated front seats; heated rear seats; wireless charging; and remote start. And you thought only Japanese SUVs came with lots of bells and whistles.
And the 2021 Atlas doesn’t stop there. The big VW also has the Car-Net telematics system. It comes with a long list of no-charge services for five years. The Atlas also serves as a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot that will accommodate up to four devices.

2021 VW Atlas: Safety Features Galore
Naturally, the Atlas has a truck-load of driver-assistance tech available. There’s Forward Collision Warning; Autonomous Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Monitoring; Blind Spot Monitor; and Rear Traffic Alert standard on all models. Traffic Jam Assist; Dynamic Road Sign Display; Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go; Lane Keeping System; Park Distance Control; Park Steering Assistant; and an Overhead View Camera are also available.
2021 VW Atlas: Pricing & Availability
If you’re in the market for a bigger family-hauler-type of SUV, the VW Atlas is worth investigating. It’s scheduled to arrive during the second quarter of this year. The table below shows the MSRP by trim level for the 2021 VW Atlas. Destination charges total $1,020 and are include in the figures below.

2020/02/07,Rock Me Amadeus: Will The 2021 Cadillac Escalade Have The Chops?,"As the 2021 Cadillac Escalade prepares to enter the market, the shoes to fill are big.
For over 20 years, the Cadillac SUV has served as a status symbol and cultural icon.
Engineers and designers were specific in their approach, especially with the interior.
Super Cruise, an OLED display, and a Night Vision system are among the tech features.
One of the biggest curve balls: a Duramax turbo-diesel engine will be available for 2021.
DID YOU KNOW
Escalade is a reference to the medieval military tactic of scaling walls with ladders to penetrate a fortified landmark.
The Cadillac Escalade first debuted at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in August of 1998. At the time, the market for large and luxurious SUVs was just taking shape. In the case of the Escalade, it was an instant hit. Cadillac President Steve Carlisle recalled how the vehicle immediately struck a chord with buyers. “It introduced Cadillac to an entirely new generation of luxury customers via popular culture and changed perceptions of what the brand could offer,” he explained. “From the highway to the big screen, the Escalade has been embraced by drivers and fans around the world.”
Setting The Scene
Be it J.Lo, Tony Soprano, or any other famous figure that seeks out an Escalade, one thing is certain: Cadillac needs to keep that image going, and they have a lot riding on the 2021 Escalade as a result. How viable Cadillac is today is another discussion entirely, and it’s probably a varied one at that. There is the cultural impact of the Escalade, the staggering sales, and how it helped pen the narrative of what a luxury SUV should be. Those things are impossible to deny.
Further, the Escalade has been J.D. Power’s “Highest Ranked Large Premium SUV in Initial Quality” five times: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2018. In the J.D. Power Automotive Execution and Layout (APEAL) Study, the Escalade received top honors in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2017.
We enjoyed driving the XT6 recently and will speak highly of the XT5, but Cadillac’s main event is the Escalade (despite the CT6 being billed as the flagship). True, the XT5 is Cadillac’s top-seller, but the Escalade dominates its market. In each year since it was redesigned in 2015, consumers have spent nearly $3 billion on the model. Sales have topped more than three-quarters of a million in the U.S. and 836,000 globally.

Do Cash Cows Always Produce Milk?
Despite the movie credits and industry accolades, it’s still hard to acknowledge Cadillac as the Standard of the World as they once were. There are notions the current Cadillac Escalade lacks in quality. Consumer Reports writes that the Escalade “falls down on the fundamentals” and lacks the braking and handling finesse when compared to other similar luxury SUVs. Ouch. And even more so, considering the starting the MSRP for a 2020 Cadillac Escalade is over $75,000.
Consider too the impact of Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the American market. Do consumers hold Cadillac in the same light? Maybe not, and that might explain why one could perceive Cadillac’s expansion into China as a much-needed fresh start. Call Cadillac’s track record of quality mixed; say they are no longer the most desirable luxury brand, but don’t call the 2021 Escalade late to dinner just yet. We would do well to hear Cadillac out. ”It’s more than a new Escalade,” Carlisle said. “It’s a new experience.”
Photo: Cadillac.
New Experiences For 2021: Diesel Power
This is familiar territory for Cadillac, debuting specific features for the Escalade that make driving one “feel like an occasion,” as Carlisle says. Magnetic Ride Control is a prime example, made famous by the Escalade before it filtered down to other GM vehicles. Other examples are the horsepower boost of 65 percent for the Escalade just last year, and the inclusion of a new diesel engine for 2021.  
Said diesel is a 3.0-liter Duramax unit with 460 lb-ft. of torque. Never in the Escalade’s history has a diesel been available and it seems hard to fathom: a diesel engine in a modern Cadillac, let alone an Escalade? Indeed, diesels have come a long way, but still: the sound and those one-off reverberating torsional vibrations? That doesn’t seem to match the refinement one might expect in the 2021 Escalade.
Spring Into Action
There are engineering tricks to minimize the vibrations of a diesel, namely a Centrifugal Pendulum Vibration Absorber (CPVA), which GM already uses. I know. Say it 10 times fast. I can barely say it once. The 2.8-liter Duramax Chevy Colorado was the first GM vehicle to incorporate such a design. The CPVA resides in the torque converter for the truck’s Hydra-Matic 6L50 six-speed automatic.
The Colorado’s CPVA is an absorbing damper with a set of secondary spring masses. Those spring masses vibrate in the opposite direction of any torsional pulsations that come their way from the engine. By vibrating in the opposite direction, the CPVA negates additional noise, vibration, and general powertrain harshness that can penetrate into the cab. The new Escalade is standard with a 10-speed automatic, although Cadillac did not say if they are using that CPVA design.
However, considering the Escalade is farther up the food chain compared to the Colorado, it’s likely they did something to minimize the intrusive effects of the diesel – be it a CPVA or otherwise. If nothing else, driving the new Escalade will definitely “feel like an occasion” with a Duramax under the hood.

New Experiences For 2021: Super Cruise
In the summer of 2018, Cadillac announced they were expanding Super Cruise to every model in their lineup by this year. Super Cruise uses LiDAR map data, high-precision GPS, an advanced driver attention system, and a network of cameras and radar sensors. Cadillac says Super Cruise helps keep drivers engaged by detecting and signaling when they need to pay more attention.
(Side note on this: when a driver gets on their phone, a robotic hand pops out of the dash and throws it out the window. The technology is still being developed and Cadillac is actively seeking hand models for the feature.)
Recent enhancements include dynamic lane offset, which adjusts the Escalade slightly over in its lane if another vehicle cuts over too close. Additionally, new messaging on the driver information center shows when Super Cruise may not be available in certain instances. Under the right conditions, Super Cruise enables hands-free driving on more than 200,000 miles of compatible highways in the United States and Canada.
2021 Cadillac Escalade: Enter NCC-1701
On the inside, the new Escalade resembles the deck of the Starship Enterprise, an effective way to, again, make driving it feel like an occasion. Of particular note is the curved OLED display with twice the pixel density of a 4K television. The thing covers more than 38 inches of real estate! It includes three screens: a 7.2-inch-diagonal touch panel to the driver’s left, a 14.2-inch-diagonal cluster display behind the steering wheel, and a 16.9-inch-diagonal infotainment screen to the driver’s right.
The curved OLED display, because of its paper-thin design and higher color contrast, does not require the usual “hood” that accompanies the typical vehicle screen.
With Forethought & Purpose
Rather than just jam a rectangular, iPad-looking thing into the dash, designers were more deliberate in placing the OLED display. It was to serve as the cabin’s centerpiece, one that lets drivers enjoy all the benefits the 2021 Escalade. Designers worked outward from the OLED display, blending together things like the custom-woven fabric, door piping, stainless-steel speaker grilles, rotary dial controller, and ambient lighting.
During those longer trips, the kids will enjoy a pair of 12.6-inch-diagonal touch displays. The rear screens have streaming capability for games, music, and videos via HDMI and USB inputs.
“The expectations and desires of Escalade customers are factors everyone in the Cadillac design studio unequivocally understands,” explained Phil Kucera, Escalade Interior Design Manager. “This allowed us to reach greater levels of depth and detail than Escalade has ever had before.”

Signature Touches: Safety & Security
While the Duramax and new OLED display will grab headlines, a lesser-known item is the Escalade’s front-center airbag, a life-saving safety feature previously overlooked until GM poineered the technology. The Escalade received the front-center airbag in 2015 and was the first SUV of its kind with such a feature.
The video below explains how it works.
Augmented Reality Navigation & Night Vision
Augmented Reality Navigation is new and available for the 2021 Cadillac Escalade. A live street view in front of the Escalade is sent to the cluster display with the corresponding turn-by-turn information. What’s neat about Cadillac’s system is how it uses the audio prompts to guide drivers. For example, a “turn left” command comes through the left speakers only, and same for a right turn command.
Like Super Cruise and the OLED display, Cadillac is further flexing their tech muscle here.
The Night Vision system is equally as cool, employing infrared technology to increase visibility. This helps drivers better detect everything from pedestrians to large animals, as they are projected on the center display once the Nigh Vision catches them. On a similar note, the surround view camera uses four exterior cameras to provide a two-megapixel bird’s-eye view of everything around the Escalade.

For Your Listening Pleasure
Premium audio systems are common in many vehicles today, so we would expect something as high profile as an Escalade to deliver the tunes. Given how important the Escalade is to Cadillac, the audio system, believe it or not, is a critical piece of the equation. It’s an essential (and really cool) part of the story behind the 2021 Escalade.
With regard to the specs: the available AKG Studio Reference system contains 36 speakers (including ones in the headliner), an enclosed subwoofer, and three amplifiers with 28 total channels. The standard AKG system includes 19 speakers, an enclosed subwoofer, and a 14-channel amplifier. One of the key differences is how the Studio Reference system allows front and rear passengers to talk with one another. Either way, both of these are beastly stereos, but they are not the only boss systems on the market.
Rock Me Amadeus
What is most interesting is how this is the first application of an AKG system ever in an automobile. And Cadillac gets the first riff, no pun intended. I can only speculate here – but – one could argue the history of AKG and the Escalade’s target demographic are closely linked. AKG was founded in 1947 in Vienna by physicist Dr. Rudolf Goerike and engineer Ernst Pless. AKG microphones were first used in radio, on theater stages, and at Jazz clubs. The products, at the time, were manufactured by hand by only five employees.
Fast forward to today, and the list of artists who have used AKG microphones and headphones includes Frank Sinatra; Eric Clapton; Peter Gabriel; Stevie Wonder; Aerosmith; the Rolling Stones; Rod Stewart; Anastasia; Eros Ramazotti; Kayne West; Simply Red; and Falco.
So humble beginnings for AKG, not unlike a lot of professional entrepreneurs today; the same kind who would desire an Escalade. And that grouping of artists above? All go-to picks for an Escalde driver, from Sinatra to West. How’s that for an eclectic mix, considering the cultural impact of the Escalade? This AKG system is no accident. Their history as a company spans a wide swath of pop culture, just like the Escalade. It may seem like a small item, but things like this cannot be emphasized enough. Buyers of a certain taste may well move toward Cadillac because of this audio system.

2021 Cadillac Escalade: Essential Foundations
With so much riding on the 2021 Escalade, both literally and figuratively, an entirely new architecture and chassis is only fitting. Similar to the OLED display, Cadillac’s engineers and designers where specific in their approach. With the suspension, they wanted something that makes the Escalade feel and handle as if it were a smaller SUV.
“Escalade’s new architecture enables a unique series of wins for drivers and passengers,” explained Tim Herrick, Vice President for Cadillac Global Product Programs. “We greatly increased passenger space, expanded cargo carrying capability – and at the same time delivered significant enhancements to both ride quality and handling performance.”
With the new architecture, third-row legroom increases 40 percent (34.9 inches), while cargo space behind the third row jumps 68 percent (25.5 cubic feet). Third-row legroom also increases in excess of 10 inches.
As for the meat and potatoes, the new independent multi-link rear suspension consists of three lateral arms; a large longitudinal arm; coil springs; and a more robust stabilizer bar. Adding to that are Magnetic Ride Control, Air Ride Adaptive Suspension, and an electronic limited-slip differential all of which are available for 2021.

An Old Favorite Under The Hood
Alongside the Duramax is the 6.2-liter V8, complete with 420 horsepower, variable value timing, and GM’s updated Dynamic Fuel Management technologies. The latter replaces Active Fuel Management and differs in how it can shut off any number of cylinders, in a variety of combinations, to boost performance and efficiency. It’s more inclusive than Active Fuel Management. Dynamic Fuel Management, by comparison, enables the engine to operate on just one or all eight cylinders, depending on driving conditions.
Manufacturing & Availability
Expect the 2021 Cadillac Escalade to arrive late this year in North America with availability in other regions to follow. The new Escalade is manufactured at GM’s Arlington, Texas assembly plant, which employs approximately 4,800 hourly and salaried personnel.
When it arrives, the 2021 Cadillac Escalade will have no less than eight color and trim choices, which include unique seat designs, with custom perforation and quilting patterns. Trim levels include Luxury, Premium Luxury, Sport, Platinum Sport, and Platinum Luxury. In all honesty, we cannot wait to see it and listen to some music on that new AKG system.

2020/02/06,2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric: Longer Range & Faster Charging,"The Hyundai Ioniq Electric is more widely available in the United States.
Standard DC fast charge provides 136 miles (80% of range) in 54 minutes.
Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and navigation are among the tech features.
The 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric is welcoming the new year with a longer range and faster charging capabilities. In truth, the Ioniq Electric is a sterling choice in the compact EV segment. But two things are holding it back from being truly great. First, it’s how Hyundai initially insisted on only selling the Ioniq Electric (together with the Kona EV) in California. Which makes sense at first, but there is evidence to suggest other states are just as (if not more so) EV-friendly as California.
Meanwhile, the plug-in hybrid and hybrid version of the Ioniq are available elsewhere, so what’s the catch?
Early last year, the Korean car maker began Ioniq Electric deliveries to all California Air Resources Board (CARB) states. This includes Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Vermont; Connecticut; Delaware; Massachusetts; Maine; New Jersey; Maryland; New Mexico; Oregon; District of Columbia; and New York. Hyundai’s done testing the waters. It’s high time for a full-on EV assault, and the Ioniq Electric is spearheading their campaign so it doesn’t languish behind the curtains with a “California-only” mentality.
Slow Start
Hyundai only sold 777 Ioniq Electric units since it was launched in 2017, and that’s not a lot. In fact, Hyundai sold more than 1,500 units of the Ioniq PHEV within a 12 month span. Expanding the supply chain will solve this problem for the Ioniq Electric, so don’t be surprised if you see more of them from here on.
However, the Ioniq Electric’s biggest waterloo is its dismal range. You see, previous models had a minuscule 28 kWh battery pack, good for just 124 miles. Admittedly, it had less range than the popular Nissan Leaf, but the 2020 model aims to change that.

Ioniq Electric: Longer Range Is Standard
Hyundai updated the previous Ioniq EV’s 28 kWh battery pack with a larger 38.3 kWh unit. This increases the range to 170 miles, which is 46 miles higher than the prior generation. Also, the figure is higher than a base Nissan Leaf, particularly the one with a 40 kWh battery pack. The Leaf with that battery pack is good for 147 miles, despite being a slightly larger battery than the new Ioniq Electric.
Granted, the Leaf Plus, with its 62 kWh battery pack, boasts 226 miles of range, but it starts at $38,200 before federal tax credits. In contrast, the base Nissan Leaf costs around $31,600 and is often the considered one of the most affordable all-electric cars, but the 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric is not far behind.
How Much Is The 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric?
The 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric is available in two trim levels. The base SE starts at $33,045 (before federal tax credits) while the Limited is $38,615. Add in another $995 for destination and handling, and the new model is around $3,000 more than before. The good news is you get a handsome list of appearance and performance updates.
The battery of the 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric was upgraded from 28 kWh to 38.3 kWh. The change increases energy storage capacity by 36 percent. Photo: Hyundai Motor America.
Tech, Styling & Safety: The Laundry List
The 2020 Ioniq Electric has a new front and rear bumper; new side sill moldings; and new wheel designs. You’ll also notice new patterns in the front grille. The base model also receives a larger eight-inch infotainment display, replacing the previous seven-inch screen while Apple CarPlay and Android Auto remain standard. Also new is a comprehensive list of standard safety features including lane-keeping assist, driver attention warning, and high beam assist.
Meanwhile, the Ioniq Electric Limited comes with standard LED headlights; a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation; ambient lighting; Harman Kardon premium audio system; and touchscreen controls for the heating and cooling system (boo!). Standard safety features include highway driving assist with SmartSense; lane following assist with SmartSense; and blind-spot collision and rear cross-traffic collision-avoidance assist with – you guessed it – SmartSense.

Larger Battery Means More Power
Of course, having a larger capacity battery means the ability to supply power to an equally larger and more powerful electric motor. The outgoing Ioniq Electric had an 88 kW electric motor good for 118 horsepower and 218 lb-ft. torque – clearly outclassed by the base Nissan Leaf with 147 horsepower and 236 lb-ft. of torque.
Now, the new Hyundai Ioniq Electric is packing a more serious punch. With an upgraded 100 kWh electric motor, it pushes 134 horsepower and 218 lb-ft. of torque to the front wheels. Yes, it’s still less power than a base Leaf, but don’t forget you have 170 miles of range compared to the base Leaf’s 150 miles of range.
Hyundai also added a new Eco+ driving mode to supplement the standard Eco, Comfort, and Sport modes. It’s also worth mentioning the new Ioniq Electric has a combined rating of 133 MPGe, making it one of the most efficient new cars sold in America.

Faster Charging
With a larger battery pack, the 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric includes a faster 7.2 kW charging unit. (The previous model had a 6.6 kW Type 2 charger by comparison). According to Hyundai, with a 100 kW fast-charging station, you can go from zero to 80 percent battery life in under an hour. Hyundai also partnered with Amazon to provide Ioniq Electric buyers with a choice of home charging systems.

2020/01/31,Acura MDX PMC Edition Arrives: Here’s How It’s Different.,"2020 Acrua MDX PMC Edition is hand-built in Maryville, Ohio.
The MDX PMC Edition has a number of special exterior treatments.
Production numbers for the United States are limited to just 300 units.
The 2020 Acura MDX PMC Edition will arrive at select dealerships as soon as this weekend. PMC is the abbreviation for Acura’s Performance Manufacturing Center based in Marysville, Ohio. The facility is famous for being the home of the NSX supercar. The MDX is the second to receive the PMC Edition treatment, joining the TLX which received the designation last year.
PMC Edition vehicles are unique in that they are assembled by hand in limited quantities. The video a little further below from Acura actually takes us inside the Performance Manufacturing Center to see how vehicles there are built.
How Is The Acura MDX PMC Edition Different?
The 2020 Acura MDX PMC Edition has a number of styling treatments versus the “normal” MDX. Most noticeable is the Valencia Red Pearl nano pigment paint, which Acura is fond of these days. The 2020 TLX uses these pigmentation techniques as well, which are applied to the micas and metal flakes during final assembly. Acura says this creates a “super-high transparency” look, and it’s hard to argue that.

Gloss Black Attack
The MDX PMC Edition receives a number of gloss black treatments too. The 20-inch wheels, roof panel, antenna, exterior mirrors, door handles, grille, and exhaust tips are all finished in gloss black. Other exterior treatments include:
Metal-finished paddle shifters.
Premium floormats with metal A-Spec badging.
Dimpled leather-wrapped steering wheel with red stitching.
Red stitched door panels, center console, headrests, and front center armrest.
Premium black Milano leather seats with Alcantara inserts, black piping, and red stitching.
Inside The Performance Manufacturing Center
What Engine Does The MDX PMC Edition Have?
The MDX PMC Edition is powered by Acura’s 3.5-liter i-VTEC V6 with 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft. of torque. The engine, complete with direct injection, is mated to a newly-refined nine-speed automatic. An active damper system and Acura’s Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) are both standard.
Acura’s new version of SH-AWD increases rear-wheel torque capacity 40 percent versus the prior generation. Up to 70 percent of the available torque can be distributed to the rear wheels; and up to 100 percent of that torque can be distributed to either the right-rear or left-rear wheel. The result is better handling and traction, regardless of weather conditions.
Interior Refinements: Comfort & Tech
Astute Acura fans may notice the similarities between the popular A-Spec package and these PMC Edition touches. Drivers are treated to heated and ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel, while second-row passengers also enjoy heated seats. On longer trips, passengers can kick back in the captain’s chairs and pull down the sunshades for additional comfort.
Back in the cockpit, drivers have access to navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, an ELS Studio 10-speaker stereo, and GPS-linked climate control (which sounds really slick). The AcuraWatch suite of advanced safety features is also standard.
How Much Is The 2020 Acura MDX PMC Edition?
The 2020 Acura MDX PMC Edition has a starting MSRP of $63,745 with destination and handling. However, if you are thinking about one, get in line as quick as you can. Acura is building just 300 of them for the U.S. market. Our neighbors to the north in Canada are only scheduled to receive 30 units.

2020/01/30,Lotus Evora GT410: Not Coming To America. But We Want It!,"Lotus Evora GT410 billed as a more affordable and practical daily driver.
Standard features include heated seats, satellite navigation, and Apple CarPlay.
The new GT410 will compliment the GT410 Sport but won’t be available in the USA.
Lotus, maker of all things light and wonderful, has just unveiled the new Evora GT410. Ah Lotus. See, I always said if they could just get some financial stability, they could do great things. And here we are with what is very definitely a great thing: the new Lotus Evora GT410. The Hethel outfit, finally going strong after all these years, has introduced the GT410 to sells alongside the Evora GT410 Sport.
What Is The Lotus GT410?
This new Evora, according to Lotus, has improved usability, more comfort, and a whole slew of features that are now standard versus being options before. Lotus aimed to make the Evora GT410 a more usable “everyday” car, a laudable goal for fools like me who look at cars like this as daily drivers.
The GT410 comes equipped with Sparco sport seats and air conditioning. There’s also a backup camera to aid with rearward visibility (always a bugaboo with mid-engine cars). There’s also a premium infotainment system with DAB digital radio, satellite navigation, and Apple CarPlay. Cruise control, heated seats, and rear parking sensors are also part of the standard equipment list.
Increased cabin sound insulation reduces road noise and improves overall refinement as well as improving the listening experience if you’re one of those car stereophiles. Other thoughtful touches include arm rests, storage bins, and revised paint choices including historic shades from Lotus’ past.

Difference Between The GT410 & GT410 Sport
The 2020 Evora GT410 includes a body-colored roof, side sills, hatch, front access panel, and mirrors. Compared with the GT410 Sport, this version has revised damper rates for a more compliant ride in the real world. Tires are all-weather Michelin Pilot Sport 4S for better year-round use. The brakes feature red AP Racing calipers and there are silver or gloss-black V-spoke cast alloy wheels; 19-inch at the front and 20-inch at the back.
Related: This book tells the story of the Lotus 72 and how it dominated Formula 1.
If this all sounds a bit too cushy for you, Lotus has also tweaked the Evora GT410 Sport for 2020. It is the most driver-focused and lightweight choice already, but the upgrades include Sparco sport seats, air conditioning, and a premium infotainment system with DAB digital radio, navigation, and Apple CarPlay.

How Much Is The Lotus GT410?
The GT410 costs £3,000 less than the GT410 Sport, or around $4,000 in American money. It’ll cost you around £82,900 total – or around $110,000 – which Lotus deems an “exceptional value” for money. Yes, that is a lot of money. Yes, that’s about what a new-ish 911 costs (and about a third of what a Ferrari does), but much to Stuttgart’s chagrin, you know the GT410 is going to out-handle 99 percent of the cars on the road.
So, everybody in the Evora family gets a little bit more for 2020. And even if a low six-figure car cannot be considered “cheap,” it can be considered a good value and livable in everyday situations. It’s just that those of us in the USA won’t be able to drive it, let alone live with it. Lotus is not making the GT410 available for the U.S. market.

2020/01/30,No Dad Bods! 2020 Dodge Durango SRT Gets New Appearance Package,"2020 Dodge Durango SRT adds more customization options with new Black package.
A sleek Redline stripe can be added to the SRT which runs the length of the Durango.
The Durango is not your average SUV, with the SRT trim approaching 500 horsepower.
Sometimes, SUVs and crossovers get classified (this also happened to minivans) as the “dad bod” of vehicles. There is that sad story of a guy; the one who trades his hot convertible, boss off-road truck, sports and/or muscle car for something with three-rows and a rear-seat entertainment package. Such a visual could easily become a Bill Burr skit about how this particular guy has nothing now to really look forward to.
However, there are SUVs and crossovers, and then there is the Dodge Durango.
The Durango can haul the family, haul the mail, and it even has those rear DVD players. And for 2020, the Dodge Durango SRT comes with a new appearance package and special Redline stripe to help chisel up that body a little more. SUVs and crossovers may have their stereotypes, but the Durango tends to easily break that mold.
2020 Dodge Durango SRT: By The Numbers
Under the hood is 392 cubic-inches of spitfire and freedom pushed through a burly exhaust. The 6.4 Hemi V8 produces 475 horsepower and 470 lb-ft. of torque, sending the Durango SRT to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. As certified by the National Hot Rod Association, the 2020 Dodge Durango SRT runs the quarter-mile in 12.9 seconds. Away from the track, the Durango SRT hauls a maximum of 8,700 lbs. when properly equipped, plenty for a weekend outing to the lake.
Related: A complete look at the 2020 Dodge Charger lineup.
To help balance all that juice, the Durango SRT comes with all-wheel drive, a special Active Damping system, stiffer front and rear springs, and Brembo brakes. The Brembo system consists of six-piston front calipers, four-piston rear, and vented rotors at all four corners. Like true performance vehicles often do, the 2020 Dodge Durango SRT has a 50/50 weight distribution.
“The numbers tell the story,” explained Tim Kuniskis, Global Head of Alfa Romeo and Head of Passenger Cars – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and Fiat, FCA – North America. “As Dodge performance enthusiasts move through the Durango lineup to the fastest, most powerful, and most capable American three-row SUV, they want their vehicle to stand out in a crowd.”

What Is The Durango SRT Black Package?
The SRT Black package features Midnight Grey Metallic and Gloss Black exterior accents, including:
Gloss Black mirror caps.
Eclipse Black Tint exhaust tips.
Satin Black “D O D G E” taillamp applique.
Midnight Grey Metallic “SRT” grille badge.
Midnight Grey Metallic “SRT” liftgate badge.
Midnight Grey Metallic “Durango” liftgate badge.
Gloss Black “4” badge with Midnight Grey Metallic Rhombi.
Midnight Grey Metallic with Gloss Black tracer “392” badge.
20-inch by 10-inch Matte Vapor wheel (Brass Monkey wheel can be optioned at no cost).
The SRT Black package retails for $1,495.
What Is The Redline Stripe?
Available on the Durango SRT, the new Redline stripe is a full-length, Satin Black center stripe with Redline Red accent tracers on each edge. The Redline stripe retails for $1,295.
The Dodge Durango SRT Black package and Redline stripe join four other available appearance options, plus five stripe options for the Durango based on trim level.
Durango appearance package options:
SXT: Platinum, Blacktop
GT: Blacktop, Brass Monkey
R/T: Blacktop, Brass Monkey
Citadel: Anodized Platinum
SRT: Black
Durango stripe options on GT, R/T, and SRT:
Bright Blue
Flame Red
Low Gloss Black
Redline (SRT only)
Sterling Silver (metallic finish)
Gunmetal Low Gloss (metallic finish)
The Durango SRT Black and Redline stripe are available with 10 colors: Billet Silver, DB Black, Destroyer Grey, F8 Green, Granite Crystal, Octane Red, Reactor Blue, Redline, White Knuckle, and Vice White.
There Are Other Durangos Too
Buyers can have a Durango with a more “sensible” package. Available for the 2020 Durango is the famous 5.7-liter Hemi, complete with cylinder deactivation to save fuel under light throttle demands. With 360 horsepower and 390 lb-ft. of torque, the 5.7 Durango can tow 7,400 lbs. when properly equipped. By comparison, the standard 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 generates 293 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. Max towing is still a healthy 6,200 lbs. when properly equipped.
But that Durango SRT tho . . .
Availability
The Dodge Durango SRT Black with the Redline stripe will be available for dealer orders in March.

2020/01/30,GMC Hummer EV: Not Exactly The Hummer We Used To Know,"The GMC Hummer EV will go on sale in late 2021.
The first ad for the vehicle ran during the Super Bowl.
GMC says the Hummer EV will have 1,000 horsepower.
The rumor mills were buzzing recently about Hummer possibly making a resurgence. Turns out, those whispers were onto something as GMC has now confirmed the Hummer EV. While it won’t be officially revealed until this spring, we received our first glimpses of it Sunday during Super Bowl LIV. The 30-second TV spot, entitled “Quiet Revolution,” aired during the second quarter and starred Lebron James.
“Teaming up with GMC to introduce the Hummer EV is a natural fit,” James said. “Everyone knows about my love for Hummer since high school and I’m proud to be a part of announcing the new EV model.”
Zero-Emissions
The new Hummer EV will be a far cry from the gas-guzzling image the brand was once synonymous for. “GMC builds premium and capable trucks and SUVs and the GMC Hummer EV takes this to new heights,” explained Duncan Aldred, Vice President of Global Buick and GMC. “We are excited to debut our revolutionary zero-emissions truck during the biggest night in TV advertising.”
Back In Action
In 2009, General Motors reorganized to focus on their core brands of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC. The bankruptcy proceedings and overall uncertainty of the company’s future caused the off-loading of Hummer, Pontiac, Saab, and Saturn. China-based Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery expressed interest in acquiring the brand from GM in June of 09.
Things seemed optimistic but the deal ultimately fell through in 2010 for a handful of reasons. GM later closed Hummer but still retained the nameplate.
A decade later, the Hummer EV enters the fold – a vastly different vehicle than Hummers past – and one that keeps Detroit-Hamtramck assembly open. The plant was due to close but recently received a $2.2 billion investment for the propose of manufacturing electric vehicles. The result is a win for those who pushed for Hummer to be more environmentally conscious, and those who advocate American manufacturing.
GMC Hummer EV: Slim Details
By the numbers, the GMC Hummer EV will boast 1,000 horsepower and 11,500 lb-ft. of torque. Wait, 11,500 lb-ft. of torque? There’s definitely a caveat there as GMC is likely citing axle torque, but for now, that’s what they are sticking with. At this point, we don’t know much else. No details yet on the electrified powertrain, total range, charging times, or price.
However, GMC says we can expect the Hummer EV to have plenty of off-road capability and a quiet interior. “The truck may be quiet, but the performance numbers speak for themselves,” James added.
Hummer EV & Cybertruck Showdown?
With the recent news of Tesla’s Cybertruck, the Hummer EV is arriving at the right time. It’s hard to say whether or not GMC could entice a loyal Tesla buyer to make the switch (or vice versa), but the potential battle is certinately interesting. The Cybertruck claimed, during its debut, and in its top configuration with three electric motors, a zero to 60 time of 2.9 seconds. The Hummer EV is really close with a zero to 60 time of three seconds.
The one race Tesla won’t win, however, is the one to market. The top-tier Cybertruck is not expected until 2022, while the Hummer EV will debut on May 20th of this year and hit the market in the fall of 2021. Also, mark your calendars for May 21st 2020. That day, several are expected to post tug-of-war tests between the Cybertruck and Hummer EV.

2020/01/18,Porsche 718 Boxster & Cayman GTS Get Slick New 4.0-Liter Engine!,"The Porsche 718 Boxster GTS and 718 Cayman GTS receive a new engine.
Active Drivetrain Mounts and torque vectoring come standard on both cars.
They will arrive this summer, although pricing has not been announced yet.
Porsche’s 718 twins – that would be the Boxster and Cayman – get an upgrade for 2020, and a notable one at that: a four-liter engine. Yes, there are other improvements for the Boxster and Cayman, but the big news here is that big engine!
Four liters is big for this size of a car. As you can well imagine, we here at Automoblog are big fans of big engines. Usually we’re very much in favor of “the biggest engine you can cram into the car” school of engineering. Obviously, if you’re not smart enough about this, you can end up with disastrous handling and a number of other maladies; but, c’mon, we’re talking about Porsche here. And if anybody has the engineering chops to handle this, they probably live in Stuttgart.
What Did Porsche Do Here?
Porsche added the two new models to its lineup, officially dubbed the 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 and the 718 Boxster GTS 4.0. Both are motivated by a sweet naturally-aspirated, four-liter six-cylinder boxer engine, cranking out 394 horsepower and 309 lb-ft. of torque. The engine, connected to a six-speed manual, is similar to the 414-horsepower version used in the 718 Spyder and 718 Cayman GT4.
The 4.0s have adaptive cylinder control, alternately switching off one of the two cylinder banks during low engine demands. The big blocks (such as they are) also have direct fuel injection with piezo injectors and a variable intake system to enhance efficiency. Porsche’s Active Drivetrain Mounts and torque vectoring capability with a mechanical limited-slip differential are also standard on the 718 GTS 4.0 models.

Power & Performance: What The Numbers Say
Currently, the Porsche 718 Boxster GTS and the 718 Cayman GTS with the PDK transmission weigh 3,098 lbs. (they are a hair lighter with a manual). While we don’t know how the new 4.0 plant will impact overall curb weight, we do know it has a redline of 7,800 versus the 7,500 limit of the turbo flat-four in the standard 718 Boxster and Cayman GTS.
Still, you don’t need to be Stephen Hawking to run the numbers. Check out these figures: zero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds, and a top speed of 182 mph! While that’s only a marginal increase over the traditional Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman GTS, we’ll take it.

Ride & Handling: Keep It Low, Keep It Stylish
Both cars already benefit from exceptionally agile handling and more precise steering thanks to the mid-engine layout (sorry Porsche purists, but it’s just better than a rear-engine car). Handling, control, and cornering is further enhanced by Porsche’s Active Suspension Management, standard on both 4.0 cars. As a result, ride height is 0.78 inches lower (20 millimeters) than the “normal” Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman GTS. 
Related: This book shows you how to own your dream 911 on a budget.
The 718 GTS 4.0 rides on 20-inch, light-alloy satin black wheels and high-performance summer tires; clocking in at 235/35 ZR 20 (front) and 265/35 ZR 20 (rear). The brake system was upped, with the cross-drilled, cast-iron front rotors now measuring 13.8 inches and clamped by red, six-piston calipers. The rear rotors increase to 13 inches. If you want even more, Porsche’s Ceramic Composite Brakes are available.

Back In Black
Like other GTS models, the 718 GTS 4.0s are visually set off with lots of black: the spoiler lip, air intake, front fascia, and the redesigned lower rear fascia are black. The front running light lenses and taillights are tinted as well. You’ll also notice the twin tailpipes with a saddle-type design to contrast the black rear lower fascia.
The interior has black Alcantara as the material of choice. It’s found on the center sections of the sport seats and steering wheel rim; center console and gear lever; door armrests and A-pillars; and the roof lining (of the hardtop). There’s an optional GTS Interior Package that sees the tachometer, seat belts, and all decorative stitching – including the embroidered GTS emblem on the headrests and Porsche lettering on the floor mats – done up in either Carmine Red or Chalk.

Track Connectivity & Premium Audio
Both cars come standard with the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system and the Sport Chrono package, including the enhanced Track Precision App. It’s a smartphone app showing performance-related data on the PCM display and records it for later analysis. The navigation system has real-time traffic information, voice control and, as an available option, Bose and Burmester surround sound stereos for good measure.
Pricing & Availability
The 718 Cayman GTS 4.0 and 718 Boxster GTS 4.0 will be available to order by this summer. Porsche says complete pricing and the scheduled arrival date will be announced closer to that time.

2020/01/18,2020 Audi A5: This Hot Tamale Is Still Smokin’,"The 2020 Audi A5 ushers in the second generation of the A5 model lineup.
Two different engines are on offer, as well as Audi’s quattro all-wheel drive.
Numerous tech and connectivity features decorate the inside of the new A5.
When Audi first rolled out the A5, they were all over the place up here in Seattle. I put that down to three factors: 1 – Audis and their quattro system have always been popular in the Pacific Northwest; 2 – there’s lots of Microsoft money in the Pacific Northwest; and 3 – these things are very good looking cars. Even in other locations, everybody I ever heard mention them always said how sharp the cars are. I know stuff like this is subjective, but there’s no way anyone is going to call these cars unattractive.
So Audi has a lot riding on the 2020 A5. They don’t want to do anything to screw up this moneymaker. And they haven’t.
One Hot Tamale
Although the engine and tech features are impressive, let’s look at the A5’s strongest point, its design. This second gen of the A5 model line is updated with Audi’s new design language to highlight its handsome body. For 2020, Audi has significantly updated the exterior with the front end baring a more powerful presence on the road versus the previous model. The grille, with its Singleframe design and honeycomb lattice, is flatter and wider for 2020. The ventilation slits above the grille are a throwback to the 1984 Audi Sport quattro.
Every A5 model is standard with LED headlights and LED taillights, while Matrix-design LED headlights are included on the Premium Plus trim. The Prestige trim gets Matrix-design LED headlights with Audi laser lights that also feature leaving and coming home animations. The video below from AutoMotoTV explains more.
Additional Style Points
If you want even more bling, that’s actually anti-bling, there’s an available Black optic package that adds black exterior trim and 19-inch, 5-arm-pylon design, titanium-finish wheels wrapped in summer tires. Body color door handles and Aluminum Ellipse Dark inlays are also included on Sportback models.
Related: I drove the Audi e-tron and it’s really odd.
Available for the coupe (and coupe only) is the S line interior package. It includes a flat-bottom steering wheel with an S badge, Alcantara seats, brushed aluminum inlays, and stainless steel pedal caps.

What Engine Does The 2020 Audi A5 Have?
As good looking as the A5 is, it’s also got the stuff under the hood, literally. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter TFSI unit that puts out 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft. of torque. When hooked to the seven-speed S tronic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive, the new A5 coupe hits 60 in 5.6 seconds. The siblings are a little slower, with the Sportback clocking in at 5.7 seconds and the Cabriolet doing it in six.
Related: Here is what you might pay to maintenance a new Audi.
The optional plant is a 3.0-liter TFSI V6 that cranks out 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. It can run from zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds; the Sportback does it in 4.5 seconds and the Cabriolet in 4.8 seconds. The transmission for the V6 is better too. It’s an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic that has lower gears with shorter ratios and longer upper gears to reduce engine revs. The combination helps with acceleration and gas mileage.

2020 Audi A5: Essential Foundations
Audi drive select is standard with four different modes: comfort, auto, dynamic, and individual. A sport suspension is available for a firmer setup, and S5 models have a Sport adaptive damping suspension available as part of the S sport package. That offers an upgraded suspension, red brake calipers, and a sport-rear differential. Dynamic steering is available with its variable ratio that adjusts based on speed and the Audi drive select settings.
Related: A complete look at the changes and updates for 2020 Audi lineup.
Interior Themes: Virtual Assistant
The interior features a large MMI touch display and a large 10.1-inch touchscreen with the all-new and faster MIB 3 infotainment system. The MIB 3 system, available for every A5, helps out with route planning and traffic forecasts, and features “acoustic feedback” to enhance ease of use. Audi says drivers can speak both commands and questions, to which the A5 will provide feedback through on-board stored data or available information from the cloud. The 2020 Audi A5 can also recognize hand-written commands.
The second-generation Audi virtual cockpit is available with three viewing modes. Audi says the 12.3-inch display (1920 x 720 pixels) increases the navigating experience through Google Earth imagery and/or 3D city maps.

Interior Themes: Lights & Sounds
Other highlights include a panoramic sunroof; three-zone climate control; ambient LED interior lighting; or the available multi-color LED interior lighting plus package. Tunes are handled via the available Bang & Olufsen sound system with 19 speakers and a 16-channel amplifier that puts out a whopping 705 watts.
How Much Is The 2020 Audi A5?
With destination, starting price for the 2020 Audi A5 is $43,895. The chart below shows the pricing by trim level. Seriously, this is a good looking car and probably worth every dime.

2020/01/17,Bentley Mulsanne 6.75 Edition: A Proper Send-Off For This Gem,"The Bentley Mulsanne 6.75 Edition by Mulliner stands as a fitting tribute.
Mulsanne production will end after these 30 special units are spoken for.
Bentley is employing the longest-serving V8 engine in the world for the car.
Bentley is sending their flagship Mulsanne sedan off with a very nice, very rare, and very well-put-together tribute: the Mulsanne 6.75 Edition by Mulliner. The company from Crewe will manufacture just 30 of the 6.75 with Mulsanne production officially ending this spring.
“The Mulsanne has played a pivotal role in maintaining Bentley’s position as global leader of the luxury limousine segment,” explained Chris Craft, Member of the Board, Sales, Marketing and Aftersales at Bentley Motors. “The flagship of our model range, its longevity is a testament to our ongoing commitment to hand-building the finest motor cars in the world. The new Mulsanne 6.75 Edition is the culmination of that achievement.”
One Solid Engine
Bentley derives the moniker for the Mulsanne 6.75 from what resides beneath that huge hood of the beast, its 6¾-liter engine. Yes, that is a whomping big plant, but you also have to figure a car the size, weight, and shape of a bank vault is going to need it. One interesting thing Bentley points out is how their big engine is celebrating its 60th year in continuous production. I had no idea they’ve been cranking that mill out since Elvis was new.
Also interesting is how Bentley’s engine is the longest-serving V8 in continuous production in the world. Longer than Ford’s flathead, longer than the small block Chevy. That’s impressive.

Bentley Mulsanne 6.75 Edition: Fitting Tribute
Other than having an engine that qualifies for an AARP membership, the Bentley Mulsanne 6.75 Edition by Mulliner has all the luxurious leather and wood, and the many other hand-crafted treatments you typically find in a Bentley. With this special edition, specifically, you’ll find references to the 6¾-liter V8 all across the car.
For example, the “organ stop” HVAC  controls are replaced by miniature designs of the engine oil cap, and there’s a 6.75 Edition motif stitched into the seats. The same motif is found on the exterior chrome, in the engine bay, and projected by the LED Welcome Lamps. The faces of the clock and other gauges will feature cutaway drawings of the engine. Bentley is proud of their long-serving power source, and justifiably so.

In the engine room you’ll find the intake manifold is finished in black rather than the traditional silver. Another special touch: the engine number plaque is signed by Bentley’s Chairman and Chief Executive, Adrian Hallmark himself, rather than the usual signature from the craftsman that built the engine.

Exterior Design
The exterior of the Mulsanne 6.75 Edition is set apart from its lesser brethren (is there such a thing as a lesser Bentley?) with gloss black bright-ware that will, according to Bentley, accentuate a customer’s choice of paintwork and other bespoke treatments. Additional dark tint treatments are seen on the Flying B bonnet mascot, the Mulliner Serenity radiator grille, and the exhaust tips. The wheels are these giant 21-inch five-spoke Mulsanne Speed jobs with a bright-machined finish and gloss black pockets.

Interior Themes
The inside looks like the drawing room from Downton Abbey. Unique features abound. There are four single tone hides to choose from: Imperial Blue, Beluga, Fireglow, and Newmarket Tan. Then there’s the bespoke color split that adds numerous silver accents throughout the cabin. The center console stack and the rear cabin console are finished in silver veneer, while the front console features a unique metal commemorative plaque. Even for Bentley, that’s classy.

New Generation Emerges
After these 30, there will be no more Mulsannes. The all-new Flying Spur will be Bentley’s flagship from here on out and will receive a hybrid powertrain by 2023, symbolizing Bentley’s commitment to a new generation of luxurious, yet sustainable mobility.

2020/01/16,2020 VW Atlas Cross Sport: Complete Look At The Pricing & Trim Levels,"The 2020 VW Atlas Cross Sport, a more athletic and stylish version of the current Atlas, is ready to go for the new model year. VW’s five-seater boasts generous interior space, a slick design, modern connectivity, and new driver-assistance features. And best of all, it starts at less than $31,000.
Atlas. There’s a good name for an SUV. It comes across as strong, capable, broad-shouldered, and manly without being misogynistic. So kudos to the folks at Volkswagen’s marketing department. And, even though the 2020 VW Atlas Cross Sport is not extra huge, like its seven-seat brother (the regular Atlas), it will be big enough for most people most of the time.
On top of that, as feature laden at the Atlas already is, the Cross Sport has more than enough comfort, convenience, and connectivity features.
What Engine Does The Atlas Cross Sport Have?
The 2020 VW Atlas Cross Sport is available in eight trim levels and comes with two drivetrain options. The first is a 2.0-liter turbo TSI engine with 235 horsepower and direct injection. The other engine option is a 276-horsepower V6, and, yeah, sounds like a better choice for us gearheads. Both engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission, carrying on the current SUV trend of auto-boxes with many, many gears inside them.
Is The VW Atlas Cross Sport All-Wheel Drive?
The Atlas Cross Sport is available with Volkswagen’s 4Motion all-wheel drive system. Even though the 2.0-liter/4Motion combo is new this year, it’s available on all eight trim levels. Thanks for giving buyers the options VW!

Exterior Design: Coupe-Like Stance
The exterior gets some freshening here and there to set it apart from the Atlas seven-seater. The Cross Sport front end features a three-bar chrome grille with a new light signature running the length of the middle bar. VW says this is “upscale” but I’ll leave that up to you. The last roof pillar is also “dramatically” raked; VW’s words, but I’m not going to argue with them much.
That also means the rear hatch leans forward giving a coupe-like profile to the Atlas Cross Sport. I know, this is an odd feature to many Americans, but Europeans have a real love for these SUVs that look like big coupes or something coupe-like. Other styling goodies are the available 21-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and the sculpted rear bumper to emphasize the Atlas Cross Sport’s aggressive stance.

Interior Themes: Plenty of Space
The Cross Sport is 2.8 inches shorter and 2.3 inches lower than the current Atlas, despite having the same 117.3-inch wheelbase. Although the interior of the Atlas Cross Sport still provides ample legroom and cargo space. Measurements come in at 111.8 cubic feet of passenger space; 40.4 inches of rear-seat legroom; 40.3 cubic feet of luggage space behind the second-row seats; and 77.8 cubic feet with the second row folded.
The interior is, of course, thoroughly modern with connectivity and driver-assistance features. All trim levels come standard with VW’s Car-Net telematics system and have on-board Wi-Fi. There’s also Traffic Jam Assist and Dynamic Road Sign Display. Finally, the steering wheel has been redesigned and there are available two-tone inserts with stitching accents on the door panels, which look nice.

2020/01/16,Genesis GV80: Inspired By South Korean Architectural Philosophy,"The three-row Genesis GV80 is the luxury brand’s first SUV.
Genesis unveiled the new GV80 recently during an event Seoul.
U.S. models receive two turbo engines; South Korea gets a diesel.
Genesis didn’t waste a lick of time. Since announcing their intentions to become a separate namesake under Hyundai in 2015, Genesis has established a presence in the United States, Canada, Russia, the Middle East, and Australia. They are now one of the highest-ranked on the market from third-party experts like Consumer Reports, J.D. Power, and Auto Pacific.
“We have created this new Genesis brand with a complete focus on our customers who want smart ownership experiences that save time and effort, with practical innovations that enhance satisfaction,” Chung Eui-sun, Hyundai Motor Company Vice Chairman, said in 2015 as the brand was announced.
Today, the Genesis portfolio consists of the G70 sport sedan, G80 and G80 Sport luxury sedans, and the flagship G90. Add one more to the list: the 2021 Genesis GV80.
What Is The Genesis GV80?
The three-row GV80 is the brand’s first official SUV, and will be available as a 2021 model. Minimalist interior, a host of high-tech features, electronically-controlled suspension, and available 22-inch wheels are among the highlights.
Initial test drive reviews from Car & Driver and Road Show are positive. Both publications also show how an SUV offering is critical now for Genesis, especially if they are to continue appealing to discerning luxury buyers in the U.S. While sedans are alive and kicking, SUVs and crossovers still command a lion’s share of the market. Parent company Hyundai knows this. Their own SUV lineup gained two critical entries this last year in the larger Palisade and the smaller Venue.
Now the attention is on Genesis and the GV80 appears to be a strong swing for the fences. In terms of product specs, here is what Genesis shared with us.

Exterior Design: Orchids & Diamonds
Like automakers often do, Genesis wants to emphasize their design language as being set apart from the group. “We enjoyed the challenge to apply ‘Athletic Elegance’ design language to SUV architecture,” explained Luc Donckerwolke, Executive Vice President, Chief Design Officer of Hyundai Motor Group. “The precise proportions and attention to every detail denote that GV80 is authentic to Genesis design principles.”
The Crest Grille stands out immediately here. Moving around the GV80, we see what is known as “Parabolic Lines” to help magnify the vehicle’s stance and presence. The Quad Lamps, which flank the Crest Grille, are an essential part of the design as well. In fact, a special “G-Matrix” pattern appears in light fixtures throughout the exterior. The inspiration? Orchids and diamonds.
“The Quad Lamp graphic will become the most recognizable, unique signature of Genesis design, as the simplest of lines communicate a distinct identity,” Donckerwolke continued.

Interior Themes: Inspired By History
Genesis draws on their South Korean heritage and culture with two fundamental concepts: beauty of white space and luxury in space. Both are important and integral themes in South Korean architectural philosophy. “We were able to express a luxurious feel for the interior of GV80 through reductive design and channeling the Korean roots of the Genesis brand,” said SangYup Lee, Senior Vice President, Head of Genesis Design. “The concept of the ‘beauty of white space’ is a hallmark of Korean design.”
Designers deliberately kept the number of physical buttons and switches to a minimum, both for aesthetic purposes and ease of use. Instead, a 4.5-inch infotainment display rests comfortably on the dash and controls many of the GV80’s functions. Higher trim levels will see more soft-touch materials throughout, including quilted knee pads for the lower sides of the center console.

Interior Themes: Tech & Comfort
Genesis wants the GV80 to be as comfortable as possible, and has taken careful steps to ensure that very thing. For example, the driver’s seat contains seven different air cells to help reduce fatigue on a long trip. Heated and ventilated seats are available for both the first and second rows (third-row occupants are out of luck).
To keep things quiet, the GV80 uses what Genesis calls Road Active Noise Cancellation technology. It analyzes road noise in real time, then generates a sound wave of an opposite phase to “cancel” intrusive noises.
The blast from the future here is how the GV80 makes use of augmented reality navigation. Genesis says it utilizes virtual driving guidelines over actual images to help occupants recognize the road. Video from the front camera displays on the center screen; then the optimal path appears in a virtual graphic so drivers can proceed along the route more accurately.
Augmented reality navigation is not necessarily a guarantee, at least for the moment. According to Genesis, the feature is only available select markets, but they made no mention of which markets specifically. However, it seems a feature like this would be destined for North America.

What Engine Does The Genesis GV80 Have?
Two turbo gas engines will be available for the GV80 in the U.S. market. Aside from that, Genesis hasn’t released any other details in terms of performance or anticipated fuel economy. The South Korean home market, however, will receive a six-cylinder diesel with 274 horsepower and a whopping 433 lb-ft. of torque. Unfortunately, that engine will not be available in the USA.
Related: Automakers are developing more SUVs for younger buyers.
Is The Genesis GV80 All-Wheel Drive?
The Genesis GV80 is based on a rear-wheel drive platform, although all-wheel drive is optional. Like the engines for the U.S. market, we don’t know much else right now about the all-wheel drive system. Genesis did say, however, U.S.-spec GV80s with all-wheel drive will have an electronic limited-slip differential.
The GV80’s body structure is primarily hot-stamped, high-strength steel. To cut weight, aluminum was used for the doors, hood, and tailgate. Photo: Genesis Motor America, LLC.
The Genesis GV80 Has Plenty of Safety Tech
The GV80 comes standard with 10 airbags, plus a host of other advanced safety features: Driver Attention Alert Warning, Rear Cross-traffic Collision-Avoidance Assist, Blind-Spot Collision Avoidance Assist, and Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist among others.
As safety features go, Smart Cruise Control with Machine Learning stands out more so than the others. It’s similar to adaptive cruise control but goes a little farther. Genesis describes it as an AI-based system with intuitive navigation. They don’t provide (at least for right now) any other details but say the system can independently learn the characteristics of its drivers, and implement autonomous contorls similar to that of human drivers.

2020/01/11,2020 Hyundai Venue: Practical & Efficient; Did Hyundai Hit a Homer?,"The 2020 Hyundai Venue is a critical part of the automaker’s SUV strategy.
It’s affordable and efficient, and ideal for buyers shopping on a budget.
A new engine and generous tech options make the Venue attractive.
According to a recent Bank of America study, as reported on by the Wall Street Journal, there are 96 different SUVs and crossovers on the market today, up from 70 in 2014. That same study finds we can expect nearly 150 models by 2023. Like many automakers are doing, Hyundai is expanding their presence in this ballooning market. Their latest offering, the 2020 Venue, is a compact machine aimed at buyers on a budget.
Just as it has been with sedans, there are larger ones and smaller ones. There are more reasonable and practical ones, and there are more luxurious and larger ones. The idea – and this probably goes without saying – is to hit as much of the market as possible, or to attract buyers at every end, from the first-timers to the affluent. SUVs and crossovers today follow a similar format.
Hyundai Establishes Their Pillars
Hyundai spent considerable time beefing up their SUV and crossover portfolio, the 2020 Venue being the latest addition to the line. Hyundai offers five SUVs and/or crossovers for 2020: Palisade, Santa Fe, Tucson, Kona (which has an EV variant), Nexo Fuel Cell, and now the Venue. Two of those are entirely new creations: the Palisade, the largest, and the Venue, the smallest. The Palisade debuted last summer (we drove it and liked it) and now the Venue.
Hyundai now has their “pillars” for their SUV lineup: one at the beginning (Venue) and one at the end (Palisade).
Idea Behind The 2020 Hyundai Venue
The Venue is what many now term as “right size” vehicles, meaning they are ideal for city driving and those who make their home in urban areas. They are generally affordable, efficient, and offer enough space for a person “on the go” as it were. Thus, the 2020 Hyundai Venue has a smaller engine, but plenty of interior technology to accommodate the lifestyle of a younger buyer.
“The Venue is a feature-filled, comfortable, and convenient vehicle in a small but practical package,” said Mike O’Brien, Vice President Product, Corporate and Digital Planning, Hyundai Motor America. “For consumers seeking modern, forward-thinking and iconic design, connectivity, maneuverability, and protection in various driving environments, Venue fits the bill perfectly.”
Below is a complete and in-depth look at what the 2020 Hyundai Venue offers.

How Much Does The 2020 Hyundai Venue Cost?
The 2020 Hyundai Venue starts near $18,500 and tops out around $23,100. There are two different packages for the SEL trim, Convenience and Premium, outlined below.
Convenience Package

What Engine Does The Hyundai Venue Have?
Under the hood is Hyundai’s new Smartstream engine, a 1.6-liter four-cylinder that creates 121 horsepower (6,300 rpm) and 113 lb-ft. of torque (4,500 rpm). The engine is connected to an Intelligent Variable automatic that sends power to the front wheels, a transmission Hyundai developed in-house (although a manual is available for the SE). Continuously Variable Valve Timing and Dual Port Injection are tech hallmarks of the new engine.
Hyundai explains that Dual Port Injection works at the beginning of the intake stroke to decrease what is known as cylinder-wall-wetting. Cylinder wall what!? The Society of Automotive Engineers has some interesting literature on it from a little over 20 years ago; but in so many words, cylinder-wall-wetting happens with port fuel injection. During engine operation, fuel droplets can condense on the intake manifold wall and intake valve. This means the air-to-fuel ratio is out of whack and, to borrow a line from renowned scientist Peter Venkman, it’s like cats and dogs living together.
An improper air-fuel ratio can mean a loss in gas mileage. Hence why Hyundai designed their Dual Port Injection system accordingly. Fuel economy is something the average 2020 Hyundai Venue buyer is going to care about.
Photo: Hyundai Motor America.
What Is The Gas Mileage of The Hyundai Venue?
EPA fuel economy estimates are 30/34 city/highway and 32 combined for automatic transmission models. Those with the manual come in at 27/35 city/highway and 30 combined. In terms of fuel economy, the 2020 Venue holds its own against the competition.
What Safety Features Does The Hyundai Venue Have?
Standard are six airbags: two front, two side-impact, and two side curtains along with a seatbelt pre-tension system and force limiters. Hyundai’s Vehicle Stability Management with traction control helps maintain direction under emergency braking or adverse conditions. The system also includes Electronic Brake-force Distribution, which balances braking force at each wheel; and Brake Assist which provides maximum ABS power when an emergency stop is happening.
Available advanced safety technologies include Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Lane Keeping Assist, Blind-Spot Collision Warning, Driver Attention Warning, and Rear Collision Cross-Traffic Warning.

Drive Modes: Ready For Bad Weather
The Venue offers three different drive modes. Normal is the first and is what the name implies. Normal is best for everyday driving and for maximizing fuel economy. Sport mode makes the throttle and steering response more energetic, although its inclusion in a vehicle like this is frivolous, if not outright unnecessary. Sport mode in smaller crossovers is far more bark than bite.
The most practical of the drive modes is Snow. When engaged, it gently sends torque between the left and right front wheels when the weather gets bad. Hyundai’s Snow mode can actually adjust between deep snow and packed snow, using just the right amount of torque to maintain traction.

Chassis & Suspension: New Approach
Hyundai’s engineers had much to consider, and a lot to balance, with the new architecture. Given the “right size” nature (i.e. small footprint) of the 2020 Venue, it needed to be smooth and manageable for city driving, yet not sacrifice interior comfort or space. To accomplish this, chassis engineers designed a special torsion-beam rear axle with taller, more upright dampers for better suspension travel.
Engineers, as they were evaluating the design, noticed the older torsion-beam axles typically had shorter dampers at an angle counterproductive to optimum ride and handling for something like the Venue. With this new rear torsion-beam, Hyundai says the Venue is easy to maneuver. The benefits transition inside, with the new suspension layout being less intrusive to the cabin.

2020 Hyundai Venue: Interior Theme
Hyundai is hoping the Venue’s interior layout will win buyers over. Useful features include a 60/40 split and flat-folding rear seat, rear cargo cover, and a dual-level load floor for easier storage. Available convenience features include two USB ports, a 3.5-inch TFT instrument cluster, rearview camera, push-button start, automatic climate control, and Bluetooth connectivity.
On the tech side, the 2020 Hyundai Venue is standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Beyond that, owners can voice-start their Venue. Hyundai’s Blue Link system works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, so just ask an enabled device, like Amazon Echo or Google Home, to “start your car.” Remote door lock/unlock, car finder, enhanced roadside assistance, and stolen vehicle recovery are also part of Hyundai’s Blue Link system.

2020 Hyundai Venue: Availability & Warranty
The Hyundai Venue is built in Ulsan, Korea and available now at dealerships. Hyundai Assurance Warranty includes a 10-year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty, although you can extend coverage on a Hyundai vehicle rather easily.

2020/01/10,"2020 Audi Q7: Mr. Roddenberry, Your Ship Is Ready!","The 2020 Audi Q7 features a more powerful turbo V6 engine.
New technology includes an MMI touch response system.
Expect the new Q7 this spring; pricing starts at $60,800.
With the new year comes the new Audi Q7. And when Audi says their big Q7 is all-new, they mean it. Stem to stern (nautical analogies are good with this ride) the 2020 Audi Q7 has received a complete update. There’s new infotainment and MMI touch response systems; exterior and interior design improvements; and a new 3.0-liter V6 with more torque and better driving dynamics.
2020 Audi Q7: Improved Across The Board
Audi says these improvements will help keep the Q7 as the leader of the luxury SUV segment – but the competition is also tough with BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo looking to gain market share. That said, let’s get the negatives out of the way with the Q7, shall we?
Sure, the Q7 is a big old barge. It is neither subtle nor efficient (although it’s not bad, given its size and weight), and it has a hefty prcie tag.
However, the 2020 Audi Q7 has enough safety and convenience features to make Gene Roddenberry blink. If you want a big SUV and you care about build quality, performance, and you do not want a Range Rover, then the Q7 will soon show up on your radar.
2020 Audi Q7: Engine & Powertrain
Audi is justifiably proud of the new V6 plant. Overall powertrain and performance figures are up and impressive for 2020. This all-new 3.0-liter V6 puts out 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. That’s impressive for that size of an engine, and it works out to a 44 lb-ft. bump over the last generation Q7. The V6 is paired with an eight-speed Tiptronic transmission, optimized for the low-end torque profile of the new turbocharged mill.
Related: Audi maintenance cost: what you might pay.
The twin-scroll turbocharger lives inside the “V” of the new V6. That kind of scares me, thermally speaking, but it does ensure better engine response and overall performance with the Q7 able to run to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds.

2020 Audi Q7: Chassis & Suspension
There is an adaptive air suspension available in the chassis department. This allows you to adjust both the ride height and the firmness of the shocks through Audi’s drive select system. The adaptive air suspension adds five selectable ride height levels: standard, off-road, lift, dynamic, and loading.
Another nifty chassis feature is the available all-wheel steering that increases the “agility” of the Q7. Agility is not a word you’d normally use with something the size, weight and shape of the Q7, but systems like this can overcome a multitude of chassis sins. Ingolstadt says the new all-wheel steering system will help with city driving, which is believable.
19-inch, five-arm, star-design wheels with all-season tires are now standard equipment, but if you’d like 20-inch Turbine-design wheels, or 21-inch Audi Sport modular-design wheels, or 22-inch Audi Sport wheels in matte platinum they are all available.
Can The Audi Q7 Tow a Boat?
Yes, but don’t go nuts. There’s an optional tow package that allows the 2020 Audi Q7 to handle up to 7,700 lbs. Think of your average sailboat and fishing boat, not luxury speed boat (especially by the time you pack all your stuff inside the Q7).
Is The Audi Q7 All-Wheel Drive?
Quattro all-wheel drive is standard, of course. The video below from Car Throttle explains how it compares to BMW’s xDrive.
New Exterior Design
On the nose you’ll find the company’s large, octagonal Singleframe grill with six chrome vertical slats, along with a new aluminum-optic spoiler (which, I think, means it’s not real aluminum?). LED headlights and taillights are standard, although HD Matrix-design headlights and Audi laser lights are available. No, I don’t think they’re actual lasers (sadly) as it would be too tempting to use them on a road full of idiot drivers.
The windows now have a general trapezoidal aspect that aims to visually reduce the size of the big Q7. Out back there’s a chrome strip to create a link between the taillights and the horizontal body line, which Audi says emphasizes the width of the vehicle. Chrome exterior window surrounds and roof rails give you some flash.

Interior Themes: Tech Paradise
The interior is about as techy as Kylo Ren’s front door lock. Audi’s second-gen virtual cockpit includes a 12.3-inch display with large satellite imagery, 3D city maps, a color heads-up display, Bluetooth connectivity, and other smartphone features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Available is the Audi phone box feature which connects compatible smartphones with the vehicle’s antenna and charges them inductively. Audi Phone Box is standard on Premium Plus and Prestige trims.
The Audi Q7’s interior has a new MMI touch response, plus other goodies like a Wi-Fi hotspot, voice controls, and various Audi Connect functions like parking information, weather updates, and Yelp reviews. The 10.1-inch upper display controls infotainment and navigation, while the 8.6-inch lower display is for for climate, comfort, and convenience functions.
Your tunage is handled by a 3D surround sound system with 19 speakers and a 15-channel amplifier. If you want more, there’s an available Bang & Olufsen 3D Advanced Sound System with 23 speakers, powered by a 23-channel BeoCore amplifier and ICE power amplifiers with a peak output of 1,920 watts.

Interior Themes: Creature Comforts
There’s a swath of standard goodies, like the multi-function steering wheel with shift paddles; three-zone automatic climate control (four-zone available); panoramic sunroof with electric sunshade; and heated power front seats with four-way power lumbar adjustments. In the back, the 2020 Audi Q7 includes the LATCH child seat-mounting points, along with a power, 50/50 split-folding third row.
There are Luxury and Black optic packages for your choosing, along with various wood inlay choices, accent colors, and interior lighting packages.
2020 Audi Q7: Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Audi Q7 should arrive this spring. Pricing runs from around $62,000 to a little over $72,000. The Premium starts at $60,800, the Premium Plus at $63,800, and the Prestige at $71,200. Tack on another $995 for destination.

2020/01/07,Lamborghini Huracán EVO RWD: New Breed For This Italian Job,"The Lamborghini Huracán EVO RWD features a naturally-aspirated V10.
Special traction control and steering technologies help balance the vehicle.
Lamborghini’s Ad Personam program is available for the Huracán EVO RWD.
More is less, or so said the architect Mies van der Rohe. Although I have my differences with Herr Mies van der Rohe, in a lot of ways, that’s a hard axiom to argue with. Take cars for example. Although I’m usually just fine with adding tech to cars, some times, adding more isn’t the right move. In fact, taking things away makes for a much better experience, especially if you love to drive. Cars like the Porsche 911 R, Dodge Challenger SRT Demon, and literally every Lotus ever made subscribe to the less stuff is better theory.
Another good example of this is Lamborghini’s new Huracán EVO RWD.
All-wheel drive cures a multitude of ills. It works better in adverse weather conditions, gives you more grip off the line, and can correct handling imbalances. Then again, you know what else corrects handling imbalances? Just making the car right in the first place. Lambo seems to have done just that, because the Huracán EVO RWD seems like quite the car, even if it is, technically, less.
Lamborghini Huracán EVO RWD. Photo: Automobili Lamborghini.
Lamborghini Huracán EVO RWD: Vital Specs
The new Huracán EVO RWD is powered by the same naturally-aspirated, 90 degree V10 found in its more common all-wheel drive stablemate. Lambo’s engine employs a long-stroke architecture, and combines multi-point injection with IDS (Iniezione Diretta Stratificata) stratified injection. Yes, that’s the same V10 found in its corporate cousin, the Audi R8. The same could be said about the all-wheel drive system, but that’s what Sant’Agata Bolognese decided to drop.
There’s also a new Performance Traction Control System (P-TCS) calibrated specifically for the rear-wheel drive layout. Probably a smart move, given how the big 10 puts out a healthy 610 horsepower and 413 lb-ft. of torque. The engine is attached to a seven-speed, Doppia Frizione dual-clutch transmission.
Given the rear bias of the mid-engine layout, combined with that much power, it would be a diabolical handful in the wet. As it sits, the Huracán EVO RWD tips the scales at just 3,062 lbs. thanks to its carbon fiber and aluminum chassis. Given what the V10 cranks out, along with this lighter chassis, the Huracán EVO RWD can run from zero to 62 mph in just 3.3 seconds, topping out at 202. Nice!

Keeping Things Balanced
That P-TCS system delivers torque in advance. Lamborghini describes the system as one that avoids a “harsh torque cut” to assure better traction when exiting a corner. Lambo says “normal traction control systems” have a tendency to sharply decouple the drive – which is usually followed by the vehicle needing to be stable again before torque can be delivered. With P-TCS that necessary torque is delivered ahead of time for better traction as the Huracán EVO RWD rolls through corners.

Automakers Respond To Coronavirus
Additionally, the electro-mechanical, servo-assisted Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) is tuned specifically for the Huracán EVO RWD. The system automatically varies the steering ratio for the best response based on the type of driving you are doing.
Photo: Automobili Lamborghini.
Soul of The Drive!
P-TCS is calibrated to the Huracán EVO RWD’s driving modes, selected via the steering wheel ANIMA button. Yes, that’s basically Lambo’s version of Ferrari’s Manatino setup, oh, and in case you didn’t get the play on words, anima means ‘soul’ in Italian, but in this case it means Adaptive Network Intelligent Management. The ANIMA modes break down like this:
STRADA: Rear-wheel slippage is minimized for stability (and safety) in all conditions, and better manages torque delivery on surfaces with less than ideal traction.
SPORT: Aims to give you maximum fun via the rear wheels being able to slide and slither during acceleration. Easy drifting without compromising safety. Huzzah!
CORSA: Balances rear-wheel slip for the best traction and agility when exiting a corner, thus maximizing overall performance. Lamborghini says this new version of CORSA improves smoothness by 30 percent and corner-exit traction by 20 percent.
19-inch Kari rims and Pirelli P Zero tires come standard on the Huracán EVO RWD. 20-inch wheels are optional. Photo: Automobili Lamborghini.
Huracán EVO RWD: Styling & Design
The Huracán EVO RWD gets a new front splitter and vertical fins within larger, framed front air intakes. The rear bumper in high gloss black incorporates a new diffuser unique to the Huracán EVO RWD.
On the inside, you’ll find an HMI 8.4-inch touchscreen in the center console with Apple CarPlay. This touchscreen controls all the car’s functions as well as managing telephone calls, internet access, and other connectivity features. Lamborghini also came up with a new color, Giallo Belenus (yellow), along with a leather and Alcantara theme for the interior trim, which matches the new exterior color.
Photo: Automobili Lamborghini.
Huracán EVO RWD: Pricing & Availability
Yes, it’ll cost a lot, but, when the Lamborghini Huracán EVO RWD arrives this spring, it will probably be worth every cent of its $208,571 price tag. If you want more, the Ad Personam program provides dozens of options for color and trim so you can create your Huracán EVO RWD to your own style and liking.

2019/12/27,Turkey’s Automobile: An In-Depth Look At TOGG’s New C-SUV,"TOGG, a mobility company in Turkey, is a collection of industry powerhouses.
“Turkey’s Automobile” is a new C-SUV with an all-electric and connected platform.
The company says they want to develop a cleaner ecosystem for future generations.
TOGG Chief Executive Officer Mehmet Gürcan Karakas explained during a forum in Istanbul earlier this year why he felt compelled to help Turkey establish its first mobility brand. “Everything begins with a dream,” Karakas said. “Once I was the General Director of Bosch Turkey and Board of Directors member, we always questioned ourselves that ‘why don’t we manufacture an automobile with our own brand in Turkey?'” 
What Is TOGG?
TOGG is a collection of five Turkish industry powerhouses and the nation’s largest, non-governmental organization. Anadolu Grubu, BMC, Kök Grubu, Turkcell, Zorlu Holding, and The Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) partnered in June of 2018 to establish Turkey’s Automobile Joint Venture Group Inc., or Türkiye’nin Otomobili Girisim Grubu (TOGG).
“We have started the journey to realize our long awaited dream,” Karakas said. “Within this process, we have observed the signs of paramount transformation and decided that we need to achieve more than just the development of a car and a brand.”
TOGG is the realization of a 60-year dream for Turkey, one that will become the nation’s first global mobility brand. The organization says they will focus on developing electric, autonomous, and connected vehicles with zero emissions.

What Is The First Vehicle TOGG Will Produce?
Recently, TOGG unveiled a prototype C-SUV and a concept sedan during a public event in IT Valley in Gebze, Turkey. TOGG will invest heavily in their manufacturing base in the next two years and launch the C-SUV in 2022. TOGG has ambitious goals for their C-SUV, saying it will have best-in-class features, including performance and acceleration, and the lowest cost of ownership.
The C-SUV, billed as “Turkey’s Automobile,” will ride on an all-electric and connected platform built by TOGG’s engineers, with Turkey owning the intellectual property rights. TOGG will employ modular architectures to support future vehicles.
“We will have a portfolio of five models that will address different needs in the market by 2030,” Karakas explained. “Our project will contribute 50 billion dollars to our national GDP, and seven billion Euros to the current account trade deficit in the 15 years following 2022.”
Styling & Design: Inspired By Tulips
TOGG worked with Italian design firm Pininfarina on the C-SUV’s styling. The idea was to create something that appeals to both Turkish and global consumers. Similar to how Toyota, Infiniti, and Mazda employ elements of Japanese culture for vehicle design, TOGG pulled from Anatolian culture. For example, a tulip design runs through the front grille and wheels, helping give the vehicle its distinct look. The tulip has a rich history in Turkey.
Although sleek, Turkey’s Automobile is more than just a pretty face. The architecture supports a number of active and passive safety features, including seven standard airbags. TOGG says they are targeting a 5-Star safety rating from EuroNCAP when the C-SUV is launched in 2022.

Interior Layout: “Smart Living Spaces”
TOGG says the C-SUV will have the longest wheelbase in its class for more headroom and legroom. Turkey’s Automobile seats five inside a cabin largely devoid of physical buttons and knobs. By using state-of-the-art touchscreens, voice-command technology, and minimalist ergonomics, TOGG wants more than just a normal interior; but rather something that functions as a smart living space.
“Today’s automobile is no longer a vehicle moving from point A to point B,” Karakas explained. “It is transforming into a smart device and a computer, and it is transforming into a third living space, after home and work.”
Turkey’s Automobile is permanently connected to the internet through its architecture, making it a full-time rolling hotspot. The vehicle pairs with mobile devices, communicates with smart homes and buildings, and any other infrastructure elements that happen to be connected. The C-SUV can also receive over-the-air software updates.

What Is The Range of Turkey’s Automobile?
The C-SUV offers two different battery packs with liquid thermal management systems. The first provides about 200 miles of range while the second offers over 300 miles of range. TOGG says the batteries can reach an 80 percent charge in less than 30 minutes.
Is Turkey’s Automobile All-Wheel Drive?
All-wheel drive is available as is rear-wheel drive. Those who like a more powerful vehicle will want to opt for all-wheel drive. Turkey’s Automobile, with a single e-motor and rear-wheel drive, produces 200 horsepower and hits 62 mph in 7.6 seconds.
By comparison, all-wheel drive models use a second e-motor to double horsepower to 400. One e-motor is positioned on the front axle while the other lives on the rear axle. Turkey’s Automobile, in an all-wheel drive configuration, hits 62 mph in 4.8 seconds.
Both models feature ventilated disc brakes, front and rear.

Autonomous Driving & Future Outlook
The C-SUV will have Level 2 autonomous driving capability, but will eventually support Level 3 capability in the future via its “flexible architecture topology.” While we have yet to learn everything about Turkey’s Automobile, it appears the vehicle will offer the some of the most advanced technology to date, like augmented reality. For example, Holographic Assistant replaces certain 2D displays (like navigation) with 3D images.
As TOGG continues to develop the C-SUV and other vehicles, the company is focused on working with their business partners, including smaller startups. Beyond automobiles, TOGG is hoping to facilitate a cleaner, more viable ecosystem for future generations.
“As one of the most excited members of the most anticipated project of Turkey, I am fully aware of our tremendous responsibility,” Karakas said. “This new world is a domain that is open to new ideas, governed by new technologies and values.”

2019/12/21,2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD: Dashing Through The Snow,"2020 Dodge Charger GT arrives with all-wheel drive capability.
The 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 delivers a healthy 300 horsepower.
Dealer orders for the Charger GT AWD will open by January 2020.
It’s snowing and let’s say you live in, oh, Iowa. You’ve got to run to the store and get some much needed supplies (beer and pizza). Now, what kind of car are you going to take? A Dodge Charger might not be your first choice, but since Mopar is now making an all-wheel drive version of their reborn Charger, it’s now a viable choice.
Or, at least that’s what Dodge wants you to believe.
Look, I’m not going to argue with them here, but what we’re really talking about is a little bit more assurance – more grip, more handling and such – regardless of (most) weather.
Muscle Car Flavor All Year
No, if you’re a resident of Iliamna, Alaska, you’re not going to ditch your jacked-up 4X4 in favor of “America’s only four-door muscle car,” but if you live somewhere besides the desert southwest or sunny Florida, the Charger GT AWD could be a sensible choice. And, if you believe the hype, you won’t be losing any of that muscle car flavor.
Dodge says adding all-wheel drive didn’t compromise the experience for muscle car enthusiasts (i.e. us) and by adding it, the Charger GT has tons to offer, all year long.

Charger GT All-Wheel Drive: How It Works
How Dodge does this is rather trick. Putting that power to the ground through all four wheels is done via this neat active transfer case and front-axle disconnect system. The Charger GT AWD can seamlessly transition between rear-wheel and all-wheel drive with no driver intervention. Under normal conditions, the front wheels are disengaged and 100 percent of the engine’s torque goes to the rear. 
When the sensors indicate the need for additional traction, the system automatically engages the front wheels, transitioning the Charger GT into all-wheel drive mode. I’ll say thanks in advance. If, for some reason, you want to manually dial up the all-wheel drive, you can do that by pushing the “sport” button.

Dashing Through The Snow
Other advanced drivetrain trickery includes the Vehicle Dynamic Control system for better handling on all surfaces, especially in snow and slush. The system provides additional traction on slippery roads to help the driver stay on the straight and narrow.

If you’re a knuckle-dragging yahoo like us and enjoy rear-wheel drive cars, even when (especially when?) it’s slippery outside, the Charger GT has a three-mode electronic stability control that can be switched completely off. Dodge says, in their press release, that the “full-off” mode is a “fun feature for drifting through snowy scenes.” (I bet that gave the legal department conniptions.)

How Much Horsepower Does The 2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD Have?
The Charger GT AWD is powered by a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, which cranks out a healthy 300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft. of torque. The engine is attached to a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic with a 3.07 rear axle ratio. In case you’re into mileage figures, the Charger GT AWD gets 18/27 city/highway and 21 combined.

Performance Goodies
The new Charger GT AWD has paddle sifters, a sport mode, and Dodge’s infamous Performance Pages. When you go with sport mode, all-wheel drive is fully engaged, gear changes are quicker, and revs are held higher for better acceleration.
There’s a nifty little button that turns on the Super Track Pak. This activates the Performance Pages and launch control features which are displayed on the 8.4-inch touchscreen. The Performance Pages show a bunch of different performance info: reaction times, zero to 60 times, G-force indicator, and lap times and such.

Styling & Design
The Charger GT’s all-wheel drive system and the other performance goodies reside beneath the car’s signature and intimidating look. Like other Chargers in the family, the GT has a performance hood, unique front and rear fascias, sculpted side sills, and a spoiler. The Charger GT AWD rides on P235/55R19 BSW all-season performance tires, mounted on 19-inch aluminum wheels in a Satin Carbon finish (optional in Black Noise).
How Much Is The 2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD?
The 2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD has a starting price of $34,995, with an additional $1,495 destination charge. Dealer orders open in January with the Charger GT AWD scheduled to arrive in the first quarter of 2020.

2019/12/20,2020 Toyota Highlander: Redesigned In The Face of Stiff Competition,"The 2020 Toyota Highlander rides on a new platform and architecture.
Gasoline and hybrid powertrains are available, along with all-wheel drive.
Tech and connectivity features include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Waze.
Toyota recently unveiled the redesigned, fourth-generation Highlander for the 2020 model year, and it’s just about time. The previous model was still riding on the underpinnings of the third-gen model introduced in 2014. We’re not saying that’s a bad thing considering the Highlander was always a comfortable yet plebian family cruiser, but it’s facing some stiff competition in the three-row midsize SUV segment.
What Is The Toyota Highlander?
The Toyota Highlander is a seven or eight-seat family SUV. The first-gen model was introduced in 2001 and shares a platform with the Lexus RX/Toyota Harrier/Toyota Camry. Meanwhile, the second-generation was the first to come with a hybrid version. The outgoing third-generation tossed the boxy styling cues in exchange for a smoother and more rounded SUV shape.
Related: This data shows Toyota vehicles are among the most reliable.
And now we have the fourth-gen 2020 Toyota Highlander. It first appeared at the 2019 New York International Auto Show and is riding on Toyota’s New Global Architecture (TNGA-K). According to Toyota, the new chassis offers greater capabilities, better comfort, and enhanced safety. Toyota says this is because their TNGA-K platform, with its extensive amount of high-strength steel, provides a more rigid unibody structure than the previous model.

What’s New For The 2020 Toyota Highlander?
The newest Toyota Highlander is completely redesigned for 2020. It’s also 2.4 inches longer, and most of that helps improve cargo space behind the third row. The previous Highlander only had 13 cubic feet of room with the rear seats upright. The length increase results in 16 cubic feet of cargo room, which is still not best-in-class, yet rightfully adequate nevertheless.
Also, the second row now slides an extra 1.2 inches for more legroom for third row occupants. And because the vehicle is riding on a stiffer platform, Toyota says the new Highlander is even more comfortable for occupants. With a smaller turning circle, it’s also easier to drive around town.

As Good As The Competition?
All of this sounds good, but not until you take a closer look at the new Kia Telluride, which is regarded by many as the best three-row SUV to come in a while. Just recently, Telluride bagged the 2020 MotorTrend SUV of the Year award for its combination of rugged styling; smooth driving dynamics; build quality; and interior refinement. It also happens the Telluride offers 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, which expands to 46 cubic feet by folding down the third row.

And while the Highlander’s third-row seating is best suited for children or adolescents, the Telluride is roomy enough to fit adults in a pinch.
Standard V6 Power
We love sprightly four-cylinder engines, but the previous Highlander’s 2.5-liter four-banger is forgettable, to say the least. In the 2020 Highlander, the four-cylinder is discontinued in favor of a 3.5-liter V6 with 295 horsepower. If this sounds familiar, it’s because the V6 is a carry-over from the previous-generation. The engine is bolted to a new eight-speed automatic.
The 2020 Toyota Highlander employs the automaker’s D-4S Injection system, which combines direct fuel injection with port fuel injectors. Photo: Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
2020 Toyota Highlander Hybrid
The new Highlander Hybrid is producing less power than before. Whereas the previous hybrid came with a V6 engine, you only get a dinky four-cylinder motor this time around. The previous Highlander Hybrid had a stout 306 horsepower, which is now reduced to 243 horsepower for 2020. Whether this is good or bad is up to you, but it does give the new hybrid better fuel economy numbers.
The 2019 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, with all-wheel drive, was good for 28 mpg combined. By comparison, the new Highlander Hybrid easily achieves 36 mpg (front-wheel drive) and 35 mpg (all-wheel drive).
How Much Can The 2020 Highlander Tow?
When properly equipped with the available towing package, the V6 Highlander can tow a max of 5,000 lbs. The package includes a heavy-duty radiator with an engine oil cooler and Trailer Sway Control.

Is The 2020 Toyota Highlander All-Wheel Drive?
The base Toyota Highlander is standard with front-wheel drive, but the Japanese automaker is offering three different all-wheel drive systems. The first is capable of sending up to 50 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels, and is optional on the gas Highlander L, LE, and XLE.
Next is the “Dynamic Torque Vectoring AWD” system found in the Highlander Limited and Platinum. It comes with a driveline disconnect system and selectable drive modes (Normal, Eco and Sport). The drive modes optimize handling by managing the electric power steering, throttle control, torque distribution, and transmission shift control according to the parameters of the chosen mode. The driveline disconnect systems does as the name implies: it automatically disengages the rear wheels for better highway fuel economy.
In the meantime, the Highlander Hybrid’s all-wheel drive system employs a separate rear-mounted electric motor to power the rear wheels. In this system, there is no mechanical connection between the front and rear wheels. The system automatically engages the rear wheels to improve acceleration while reducing slippage over rough or slippery terrain.

Refined & Tech-Filled Interior
The new Toyota Highlander’s cabin seems erringly similar to the outgoing model, especially in the dashboard. But then again, the 2020 Highlander benefits from wider door armrests; an eight-inch touchscreen display; and slightly better fit and finish with soft padded surfaces and better stitching throughout. The Highlander Platinum receives a larger 12.3-inch touchscreen along with navigation and a JBL audio system.

The 2020 Toyota Highlander is finally equipped with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Alexa connectivity. The cabin also benefits from Qi wireless charging and a plethora of USB charging ports. On the safety front, all trim models of the 2020 Highlander receive Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 which includes a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection; dynamic cruise control; lane departure alert with steering assist; automatic high beams; lane tracing assist; and road sign assist.

2019/12/20,Porsche Macan GTS: New & Improved For 2020 (And Great Brakes Too)!,"2020 Porsche Macan GTS arrives with new performance updates.
The V6 features two turbochargers in the inner V of the engine.
And the braking system for the Macan GTS is pretty boss too!
“Macan GTS returns for 2020 with improved performance,” Porsche says in their latest press release. Well that’s a surprise. Oh wait, no it isn’t. Porsche has a wonderful habit of making their cars a little bit better, year after year, generation after generation. A nice, steady methodical chain of improvements. That’s a good trend to see in an car company, no?
Now, these aren’t revolutionary improvements we’re talking about. This is more of a nip here, a tuck there. But they do add up to be better than last year.
What Engine Does The 2020 Macan GTS Have?
The 2020 Macan GTS, the sportiest version of the line, comes powered by a 2.9-liter twin-turbo V6. The engine cranks out a healthy 375 horsepower (that’s a bump of 15 horsepower over last year) and is mated to a PDK dual-clutch transmission, a sound performance choice. Maximum torque is 383 lb-ft., up 14 lb-ft. from last year.
The powertrain allows the Macan GTS to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in a scant 4.7 seconds. If you opt for the Sport Chrono package, you get to 60 in 4.5 seconds. Top speed is 162 mph. Also healthy.

2020 Porsche Macan GTS: Powerful Brakes
The Macan GTS stops on a dime thanks to “generously sized” cast iron brakes. In other words, they’re b-i-g: 360 x 36 millimeters at the front and 330 x 22 millimeters at the rear. Nice! If that’s not enough, there are optional Porsche Surface Coated Brakes with tungsten carbide coating clocking in at 390 x 38 millimeters at the front, 356 x 28 millimeters out back.
Related: Every Porsche owner should read this book.
Still want more stopping power? Then tick the option box for the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes which measure 396 x 38 millimeters at the front and 370 x 30 millimeters at the rear. Those could probably stop a 747 when it lands.
The adaptive air suspension can lower the Macan GTS by 10 millimeters. Photo: Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
Styling & Design
Visually, the new Macan GTS stands apart with a standard Sport Design package that includes new front and rear trim, plus new side skirts. The front fascia has the blacked-out design elements like all Porsche GTS models, but that theme carries through to the rear. The LED headlights (with Porsche’s Dynamic Light System), the three-dimensional rear lights, and the LED light bar at the rear are also darkened.
The trim strips along the vehicle are black, which match the black accents on the diffuser and tailpipes of the standard sport exhaust system. However, the brake calipers are a bright red.

Interior Treatments
The interior of the 2020 Porsche Macan GTS is not left out of the fun either. There’s Alcantara on the seat center panels, the center console armrests, and door panels, along with brushed aluminum accents throughout. The multi-function steering wheel is wrapped in smooth leather, as are the sport seats of the Macan GTS. Those sport seats feature eight-way adjustment capability and side bolsters to hold you in place during cornering.
Options for the GTS interior include Carmine Red or Chalk stitching plus additional Alcantara features; a Bose Surround Sound system; and a new smartphone tray with inductive charging functions. There’s also Park Assist including Surround View, a heated windshield, and an ionizer available as optional equipment.
How Much Is The 2020 Porsche Macan GTS?
The 2020 Porsche Macan GTS is expected at U.S. dealerships this summer with pricing starting at $71,300.

2020 Ford Expedition Trim Levels
XL, XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum make up the trim levels for 2020. The XL is a fleet option only. Each trim level can be outfitted as a MAX, also known as the extended-length Expedition. In the MAX configuration, total cargo volume increases to 121.5 cubic feet versus the 104.6 cubic feet of the standard wheelbase, or “normal” Expedition.
4×2 is standard, although Ford’s Control Trac four-wheel drive system is available.
2020 Ford Expedition King Ranch
The King Ranch returns to the Expedition lineup for 2020, a trim level inspired by Captain King’s actual ranch in Texas. Premium Del Rio leather covers all three rows, while Ebony Del Rio and Mesa Del Rio decorate the door trim and armrests. On the outside, King Ranch Expeditions ride on 22-inch, six-spoke machined-aluminum wheels with dark tarnish pockets. The wheels compliment a number of other exterior highlights like the Stone Gray grille, lower bumpers, and power-deployable running boards.

2020 Ford Expedition Limited FX4
According to MaritzCX market research, nearly 20 percent of Ford Expedition owners use their vehicle for off-road adventures, with 45 percent taking their SUV hunting, camping or fishing. “There’s a growing trend in people looking to enjoy rugged terrain without having to give up the refinement, comfort or convenience of getting there,” said Devin McParlane, Ford Expedition Consumer Marketing Manager.

Which brings us to the 2020 Ford Expedition Limited with the FX4 off-road package. The FX4 designation has been synonymous with the blue oval since the early 2000s with the F-150. Now the off-road treatments jump to the Expedition Limited for 2020. The FX4 package is available for both the standard Expedition and the Expedition MAX.
2020 Ford Expedition Limited with the FX4 Package.
What’s Included In The FX4 Package For The Expedition?
The FX4 adds 32-inch all-terrain tires, 18-inch metallic gray, cast-aluminum wheels, and premium off-road-tuned shocks. Like prior Ford models with the FX4 namesake, the 2020 Expedition Limited will receive new skid plates – seven in total – for chassis and underbody protection. There are skid plates to protect the steering gear, engine, transmission and transfer case, plus a full-length guard for the fuel tank. A sand shield has been added to protect the engine’s turbocharger.
Ford says the chin spoiler beneath the front bumper is shorter to improve approach angles while climbing obstacles off-road. The chrome-plated running boards include additional off-road protection.
On the inside, the Expedition Limited FX4 includes a 360-degree camera system with split-views; leather seating and wood accents; rubber floor mats; and special FX4 badging.

What Engine Does The 2020 Ford Expedition Have?
Under the hood of every Expedition is a 3.5-liter, turbocharged EcoBoost engine with 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft. of torque. The engine features a forged steel crankshaft, aluminum alloy cylinder heads, and a 10.0:1 compression ratio. Ford attaches the engine to a 10-speed automatic transmission.
4×4 models come with two different final drive ratios: 3:31 for the standard wheelbase and 3:73 for the MAX. The Expedition Limited FX4 features a 3:73 rear end by default with a two-speed, electronically-controlled four-wheel drive transfer case that allows for neutral towing.
4×2 standard wheelbase models come with a 3.15 final drive ratio; 4×2 Max models come with a 3.31 rear end.

Without the package, towing for 4×4 models drops to 6,500 lbs. 4×2 Expeditions with a standard wheelbase increase only slightly in towing capacity: 6,600 lbs. without the heavy-duty trailer package and 9,300 lbs. with it.
In the MAX configuration: Both 4×2 and 4×4 MAX models can tow 6,600 lbs. without the heavy-duty trailer package and 9,000 lbs. with it.
Pro Trailer Backup Assist is available for the 2020 Ford Expedition. The video below explains how to set up and use the feature.

2019/12/15,"2020 Honda Ridgeline, Fit & HR-V Arrive: Here’s An Overview of Each","The 2020 Honda Ridgeline, Fit, and HR-V have made their way to dealer showrooms. Although each are different in terms of performance and their intended market, each are affordable, safe, and fuel efficient. We will take a brief look at these new Honda vehicles, covering all of the updates and pricing info for 2020.
2020 Honda Ridgeline: What’s New
The Ridgeline is now standard with the Honda Sensing suite of active safety features. The package includes Collision Mitigation Braking; Forward Collision Warning; Lane Keeping Assist; Road Departure Mitigation; Lane Departure Warning; and Adaptive Cruise Control. Honda is anticipating high safety marks for the 2020 Ridgeline from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety when they become available.
Also available are LED headlights (low beam), an eight-way power driver’s seat with adjustable lumbar support, and ambient interior lighting. Add Apple CarPlay and Andriod Auto to the list of features for the 2020 Honda Ridgeline.

Get Ready For Tailgating!
The Ridgeline’s tailgate swings open a bit wider than before for easier cargo loading. For those Saturday and Sunday gatherings during football season, the Ridgeline offers a 115V AC power outlet and a truck bed audio system. When transporting more valuable or fragile items, drivers will appreciate the lockable and weather-sealed in-bed trunk.
What Engine Does The Honda Ridgeline Have?
Motivating force comes from a 3.5-liter V6 with direct injection, Variable Cylinder Management, and Honda’s now-world-famous i-VTEC setup. The engine produces 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft. of torque. All-wheel drive is available on all trim levels and standard on RTL-E and Black Edition.
Be it boulevard cruising or tackling the trails, every 2020 Ridgeline makes use of Honda’s Intelligent Traction Management System. Said system has four different modes: Normal, Snow, Mud, and Sand for the all-wheel drive models, as well as Normal and Snow for 2WD vehicles.

What Can The Honda Ridgeline Tow & Haul?
The 2020 Honda Ridgeline has a 5,000 lbs. max towing capacity and 1,584 lbs. max payload capacity when properly equipped. While the competitors offer more towing capacity, the Ridgeline’s V6 tops other similarly-sized engines in the segment in fuel economy.
When Honda debuted this generation of the Ridgeline in 2017, they explained how customer feedback determined the design of the truck. One thing Honda noted was how few regularly tow over 5,000 lbs. At the time, Honda said rather than up the towing capacity to match the likes of the Tacoma and Colorado, they put more emphasis on handling and fuel economy. The idea was to create a more balanced truck.

2020 Honda Fit: What’s New
The 2020 Honda Fit wraps affordability, fuel efficiency, and fun into one neat package. It may not seem possible, but the 2020 Fit will “fit” (see what we did there) quite a bit of cargo. By mounting the fuel tank under the front seats, Honda’s engineers were able to net 52.7 cubic-feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down!
Every Fit model comes with a multi-function center console, rearview camera, auto on-off headlights, LED taillights, and Bluetooth capability. The Fit Sport adds extra connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Like the Ridgeline, the Honda Sensing safety package is available for the Fit but with some caveats. For the 2020 model year, Honda Sensing is no longer available on LX and Sport.

2020 Honda HR-V: What’s New
For the 2019 model year, Honda gave the HR-V a refresh so there are only minor changes for 2020. One of the biggest selling points for the HR-V is safety. Honda received a 5-Star Overall Vehicle safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and is targeting a Top Safety Pick rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The automaker is also expecting a “Superior” rating from the latter for front crash prevention when the HR-V is equipped with Honda Sensing.

All wheel-drive is available for every trim level of the 2020 Honda HR-V and standard on the Touring. The system operates in front-wheel drive the majority of the time to conserve fuel, however, it can send power to the rear when necessary. During bad or snowy weather, or for light off-road use, all-wheel drive will come in handy.
Under the hood is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder creating 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft. of torque. The engine, complete with Honda’s i-VTEC system, is attached to a continuously variable automatic transmission.

2019/12/14,2021 Chevy Suburban & Tahoe: GM’s Newest SUVs Come To Town!,"The 2021 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe will arrive in the middle of next year.
Both receive an extensive overhaul, from under the hood to inside the cabin.
Chevy’s Suburban and Tahoe are big in outright size, but also with regard to sales. In many ways, they are the benchmark in terms of what buyers expect when it comes to full-size SUVs. So, when they roll out all-new versions of the big best-sellers, there is a lot at stake and a lot to pay attention to. Add to that how the Suburban was just honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Chevy seems poised to have a big year.
Let’s see what The Bowtie Brigade is up to this time around.
New Chassis & Suspension
When Chevy says “all-new” they aren’t kidding. The chassis and architecture is completely new to compliment the longer wheelbase. This new architecture, according to Chevy, translates into improvements in passenger accommodations, cargo capacity, and driving dynamics. The ride is smoother on uneven pavement and unpaved surfaces with optional features like Magnetic Ride Control and Air Ride Adaptive Suspension.
The 2021 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe ride on arguably the most advanced suspension in this segment. Both make use of a multi-link independent rear suspension, composed of three lateral arms; a large longitudinal arm; coil springs; and a robust stabilizer bar. This independent rear suspension is matched with available Magnetic Ride Control and an Air Ride Adaptive Suspension.
How Air Ride Adaptive Suspension Works
Chevy’s Air Ride Adaptive Suspension offers load-leveling at all four corners of the vehicle, and up to four inches of ride-height adjustment. On the highway, for example, the system automatically lowers by ¾-inch (19 mm) to improve aerodynamics and efficiency. Drivers can also raise things up a bit for extra ground clearance, or down two inches for easier entry and exit. Not a low rider exactly, but impressive still.

What Engines Do The 2021 Chevy Suburban & Tahoe Have?
There’s a new 3.0 liter Duramax turbo-diesel offering 277 horsepower (207 kW) and 460 lb-ft. of torque. With the diesel option, Chevy is aiming for higher fuel economy versus the competition, but the EPA has not returned actual figures yet. If gasoline is more your style, the updated V8 engines offer Dynamic Fuel Management (i.e. cylinder deactivation) along with direct injection and variable valve timing.
The evergreen 5.3 and 6.2 return yet again, with 355 horsepower for the 5.3 and 420 for the 6.2-liter. Gear selection is handled by a standard 10-speed automatic for all engines with push-button electronic shifting.

Interior Tech & Treatments
Of course the interior has gotten a complete going over. For a start, you can get up to five display screens in total. Yes, that seems a bit excessive, but these are big, luxurious SUVs here and, on top of that, this is a 2021 vehicle we’re talking about. People today don’t just love their screens, they need their screens! So five seems like a good number.
There’s the standard 10-inch diagonal central color touchscreen. It’s the largest in the segment, according to Chevy, in case you were wondering. There’s also an available eight-inch diagonal instrument cluster, and an available 15-inch head-ups display, which no competitor offers (probably because that’s frickin’ huge). Another option is the dual, 12.6-inch rear-seat LCD displays, part of the Suburban and Tahoe’s rear entertainment system. Each screen has different connections, so passengers can watch whatever they please without affecting each other.
This, combined with all that extra passenger room and buttery-smooth suspension, will probably be the biggest contributors to overall family harmony on a long trip.

How Much Cargo Space Do The 2021 Chevy Suburban & Tahoe Have?
There is 66 percent more cargo room behind the third row in the Tahoe now, which means you can carry lots of people and even more stuff. There’s also that 10 additional inches of third-row legroom for Tahoe passengers, another metaphorical lifesaver on long family road trips; more room, more comfort, and less of a chance the kids will go stir crazy – especially with all the available tech we just covered!
As far as the Suburban is concerned, it gets a 19 percent bump in maximum cargo space behind the first row. The second and third rows grow in legroom by 2.3 and 2.2 inches respectively, to now 42 and 36.7 inches. The Suburban and Tahoe’s load floors are also significantly lower than previous generations, which Chevy says increases the overall cargo space.
Safety & Security
Safety? Tons of safety stuff is to be found with the 2021 update for the Suburban and Tahoe. There are over 30 safety and driver convenience features alone, including side-impact airbags; Passenger Sensing System; HD Rear Vision Camera; Automatic Emergency Braking; Forward Collision Alert; Following Distance Indicator; Front Pedestrian Braking; Rear Park Assist; IntelliBeam automatic headlamp control; and Hitch Guidance for towing.
Pricing, Availability & Manufacturing
The 2021 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe will go on sale midway through 2020. Trim levels include LS, LT, RST, Z71, Premier, and High Country. Nine exterior colors, including three new ones (Empire Beige Metallic, Cherry Bomb Tintcoat, and Darkmoon Blue Metallic) will also be available.

2019/12/14,2020 BMW M2 CS: Small But Potent Performance Car,"The 2020 BMW M2 CS is loaded with power and carbon fiber.
BMW says the M2 CS hits 60 in 3.8 seconds and tops out at 174.
One model year only (sadly) with production beginning in March.
The latest, improved iteration of BMW’s M2, the M2 CS, is here. And it brings tons of tech, carbon fiber, and (checks notes) power. Lots and lots of good old Bavarian power and torque to remind us, yet again, how the “M” in BMW stands for Motor with a capital M. Okay, it stands for “Motoren” but why get bogged down in semantics?
As BMW cars often do – quickly stop and turn, then go like blue blazes on a hot day – the 2020 M2 CS is no different.
What Engine Does The 2020 BMW M2 CS Have?
The powerplant motivating the M2 CS is the S55 unit derived from the M4 Competition. This uprated S55 is a 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder, with BMW’s TwinPower Turbo technology. The engine cranks out a very healthy 444 horsepower and 406 lb-ft. of torque. That is a lot, both for this size of engine, and the size of the car it’s stuffed into. It will add up (or all boils down to) a zero to 60 time of 3.8 seconds when mated to the seven-speed dual clutch (DCT) transmission.
If you opt for the six-speed manual, it’ll cost you a couple of tenths, at four seconds flat to 60 mph.
2020 BMW M2 CS. Photo: BMW of North America, LLC.
2020 BMW M2 CS: Under The Hood
All this power is delivered through a combination of two, quick-spooling mon-scroll turbochargers; a high-precision direct injection system; and BMW’s Valvetronic (variable valve timing) and Double-Vanos (fully variable cam timing) systems. Together, these deliver a wide, flat torque curve all the way to the 7,600 rpm redline.
The engine block itself is a closed-deck affair to handle the higher cylinder pressures. BMW went so far as to dress the cylinder walls with a wire-arc spray-on coating instead of liners to reduce weight. It also raises the cool factor a bunch for us gearheads! Also cool is how the exhaust gas is sent through a dual-branch exhaust system with electronically-controlled valves. BMW also gives you the chance to vary the exhaust sound via the M Engine Dynamics control switch in the center console. Not sure why, but there it is if you want to.

The CS has three radiators: the “normal” central radiator and two smaller side radiators. There’s also an oil cooler, two scavenging pumps in the oil sump pan along with a sump baffle to help control oil movement under “all circumstances,” i.e. heavy G loads during hard cornering, acceleration, and braking. If you opt for the DCT, you’ll get a separate transmission oil cooler as part of the package.

Transmission Tech
Speaking of things with whirring gears and such, the new BMW M2 CS comes standard with the six-speed manual gearbox I mentioned before. It’s compact and light and uses a carbon-fiber friction lining to enhance the shifting feel. Rev-matching blips the throttle during downshifts and lowers the engine’s revs on upshifts.

If your taste in transmissions runs towards something more modern, then you’ll be interested to hear how the seven-speed M Double Clutch Transmission is an option. BMW says it offers fast and smooth gear changes with no interruption in the flow of power. You can change gears either in automated or manual mode by using the gearshift lever on the center console or shift paddles on the steering wheel. Yeah, I know. That seems kind of redundant and weird, but there it is.
In either automatic or manual modes, you can choose between three driving programs: COMFORT, SPORT and SPORT+.

Traction Jackson!
Not one to leave a technical stone unturned, BMW has also equipped the M2 CS with a trick Active M Locking Differential. The electronically-controlled, multi-plate locking diff can vary the locking effect from zero to 100 percent according to the driving situation; the car’s steering angle; accelerator position; brake pressure; engine torque; and wheel-speed and yaw rate.
Related: The big boss gets overhauled: an in-depth look at the 2020 BMW 7 Series.
The control unit uses this data to detect traction loss on one side of the car, calculating the required locking effect then engaging the electric motor. Full locking power of over 1,800 lb-ft. is available within 150 milliseconds, allowing the system to prevent wheel spin on slippery roads, or any time the rear wheels experience differences in traction.
BMW’s differential even works proactively. For example, when pulling away on slippery surfaces, the lock is closed by a defined percentage even before a wheel can start to spin. According to BMW, this ensures both wheels develop equal slip simultaneously. Ultimately, BMW says this type of differential control increases agility, minimizes understeer, and improves overall directional stability. Sweet!

The BMW M2 CS Is Stacked With Carbon Fiber
The M2 CS also has a truckload of carbon fiber goodies. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer is used throughout the vehicle to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The carbon fiber hood, which is new, weighs half of a steel one and incorporates functional air vents. The roof is also a carbon fiber deal and made from a “rigid sandwich construction” meaning no roof bow components nor insulation.

Other carbon goodies include the front splitter, exterior mirrors, and the rear spoiler and diffuser.

When Is The 2020 BMW M2 CS Available?
No word on pricing or when you can pick one up exactly, but ask your BMW dealer for answers to both. Unfortunately, the M2 CS is only being made for one model year with production beginning in March.

2019/12/13,2020 Cadillac CT4: Sportiest Cadillac Ever? Maybe So.,"2020 Cadillac CT4 revealed during GM’s recent social media campaigns.
Cadillac is aiming for a younger market with the forthcoming 2020 CT4.
The CT4’s rear-drive architecture and platform supports all-wheel drive.
New tech features include Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Super Cruise.
What does it say when a car maker first introduces a high-performance version over the base model? That’s what happened with the 2020 Cadillac CT4. About six months ago, Cadillac unveiled the CT4-V ahead of the base CT4, and we found it a bit strange. Apparently, it signifies Cadillac’s desire to shed its image as your grandparent’s car.
“Cadillac is intent to building the most exhilarating sport-luxury sedans,” said Rob Kotarak, Cadillac Chief Engineer. “Every element of the CT4 is designed to bring innovative technologies right to the driver, providing discerning driving dynamics with cutting edge precision.”
And with that, it seems the CT4 is bringing back the fun in Cadillac’s portfolio of luxury sedans.
What Is The 2020 Cadillac CT4?
The 2020 CT4 replaces the ATS in Cadillac’s lineup. Interestingly enough, the ATS straddles the fine line between a compact and subcompact vehicle, and therein lies the problem. The outgoing ATS was too small to compete for bragging rights with the BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. However, it’s too big to slug it out with the Audi A3, Mercedes-Benz A-Class, and even the BMW 2-Series Gran Coupe.
Here’s the catch: The new Cadillac CT4 is riding on the underpinnings of the ATS. In fact, the CT4 and ATS share the same wheelbase. However, Cadillac was kind enough to elongate the CT4 by around five inches to give it some presence on the road.
Would we have wished for a different platform? Maybe. Don’t forget, Cadillac managed to sell a lot of ATS and CTS sedans, and they took the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it approach’ with the new CT4. Even if the CT4 is essentially an ATS underneath, it promises to make up for the shortcomings of the old ATS with new tech and better refinement. At least, that’s what Cadillac is aiming for.

What Engine Does The 2020 Cadillac CT4 Have?
A slew of turbo engines serve as the motivating force behind the 2020 Cadillac CT4. Standard fare is a 2.0-liter, twin-scroll turbo four-banger. Equipped with Cadillac’s three-step sliding camshaft technology (with active fuel management), the engine produces 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque.
It sounds impressive until you realize the ATS had 35 more horsepower from its base four-cylinder turbo unit. If the goal is to entice younger and energetic buyers, or even appeal to more established ones who grew up in the muscle car era, we’re not off to a good start. Still, when paired with an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive, we think the base CT4 is fairly brisk, our personal love for horsepower aside.

Thankfully, moving up the trim ladder reveals a more potent 2.7-liter four-cylinder with 309 horsepower and 348 lb-ft. torque. Sounds familiar? Oh yes, it’s the same turbo four-pot in the new Chevy Silverado 1500, but Cadillac tuned the motor to churn out 10 more horses along with 21 more lb-ft. of torque than the Silverado.
Meanwhile, the CT4-V receives a higher-performing 2.7-liter turbo with 325 horsepower and 380 lb-ft. of torque. Both 2.7-liter mills are connected to a new 10-speed automatic gearbox with rear-wheel drive.
Is The 2020 Cadillac CT4 All-Wheel Drive?
All-wheel drive is an option across the range. If you opt for it, you also get a mechanical limited-slip differential and a magnetic suspension with ZF passive dampers.

Youthful & Exuberant Styling
The new Cadillac CT4 has the proportions of a proper rear-wheel drive sedan with its longer dash-to-front-axle ratio and wide stance. In truth, it looks more dynamic than the ATS without losing its sense of aristocracy. “We developed CT4 to appeal to youthful buyers in the luxury market who may be new to the Cadillac brand,” explained Andrew Smith, Executive Director of Global Cadillac design. “The vehicle was intended to draw attention, using a combination of great proportions, taut surfacing and Cadillac family details that hint at the athletic driving experience this vehicle offers.”
Despite being the sportiest Cadillac yet, the new CT4 still has a plethora of bright exterior accents and unique grille designs to differentiate each trim model. By comparison, the Sport and V-Series receive darker accents and unique grille designs, along with new performance wheels and a rear spoiler.

Selectable Driving Modes
No modern car is complete without a set of selectable driving modes. Standard across the board, the new Cadillac CT4 has four main drive modes namely Tour, Sport, Snow/Ice, and Track. You also get a new My Mode feature and a V-mode for the V-series CT4.
Related: Is the 2020 CT4 injecting new energy into American sedans?
Cadillac made use of their proprietary, double-pivot MacPherson front suspension with dual lower ball joints for the new CT4. With a near-perfect weight distribution, the chassis is further enhanced by a Bosch electric and rack-mounted power steering system, plus eBoost brakes with GM’s Duralife coated rotors and low-drag brake calipers. Sport and V-Series models receive a set of Brembo front brakes.

2020 Cadillac CT4: Technology At Its Core
Since Cadillac made it clear the CT4 is intended for a new (and younger) generation, it’s not surprising how the car is more tech-filled than a Radio Shack. Front and center is a new, high-definition eight-inch touchscreen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Drivers now stare at a full-color, dual-display instrument cluster while automatic climate control takes care of the heating and cooling.

The CT4 also benefits from GM’s new digital vehicle platform using a bespoke electronic architecture. This new platform enables the CT4 to receive over-the-air updates similar to how Tesla does. The architecture also handles Cadillac’s Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving feature.
“The first-ever Cadillac CT4 changes the sport-luxury sedan game, fusing technology and performance in a distinctive design for customers who want to express themselves,” said Melissa Grady, Cadillac Chief Marketing Officer. “Because the CT4 is equal parts technology and performance, we wanted to reveal it in a way that would stimulate the senses and evoke emotions our customers might feel when behind the wheel.”

2020 Cadillac CT4: Pricing & Availability
Cadillac has yet to announce pricing on the new CT4, although we’re expecting it to start at $35,000 for the base model and around $65,000 for the CT4-V. However, dealers are accepting orders for the CT4 with initial deliveries due in early 2020. The new CT4 will be manufactured at GM’s Lansing Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan.

2019/12/11,5 Free Jaguar I-PACE Updates Now Available For Owners,"Using knowledge gained from the I-PACE eTROPHY series, Jaguar developed new software updates for their all-electric I-PACE SUV.
The free updates for customers improve battery performance and deliver up to 12 miles of additional range on a full charge.
Here is a look at the free Jaguar I-PACE updates and how they work.
You know what they say: racing improves the breed. That is demonstrably true, but if you needed more proof, look no further than what Jaguar has been up to with its I-PACE EV crossover that races in a one-make support series to Formula E. The breakdown here is that what Jaguar has learned racing their crossovers on the track (stop laughing, it’s not funny) they are directly applying to any and all current I-PACE owners.
And Jag isn’t even going to charge you.
How Jaguar Is Doing The Updates
The improvements Jaguar has found from racing can be rendered via software updates. How cool is this?! I-PACE drivers can get an early holiday present from the Coventry firm thanks to a complimentary update designed to deliver increased range and performance. Complimentary as in free! saWEET!
Engineers back at home base have employed the technical insights gained from the Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY race series. As it concerns the road-going I-PACE, Jaguar’s engineers are applying these technical insights to increase the efficiency of the vehicle’s all-electric powertrain. This includes things like optimizing battery performance and enhancing the thermal and all-wheel drive systems accordingly. Those same engineers also analyzed data from more than 50 million miles of real-world testing from all corners of the planet.
“The Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY has generated a huge amount of data for us to analyze and those marginal gains, derived from competition on the track, are now being applied to customers’ cars to further enhance their driving experience,” explained Stephen Boulter, I-PACE Vehicle Engineering Manager. “The new software updates optimize the powertrain control systems to improve efficiency and allow I-PACE drivers to travel even further on a single charge without any hardware changes – it really is a case of the vehicle getting better with age.”

Applying The Knowledge Gained From Racing
Jaguar started the I-PACE eTROPHY series in 2018 making it the world’s first all-electric and production-based international race series. Yes, Elon Musk said they were going to do that with Tesla, but, well, you know, Elon says a lot of things that never seem to happen. Anyway, Jaguar, being a company rooted in high performance and racing is leveraging track-gained knowledge to develop future electric road cars as part of its “Race to Innovate” mission.

Free Jaguar I-PACE Updates: What’s Included?
#1: All-Wheel Drive. Changes to the torque distribution between the front and rear motors deliver greater efficiency when driving in ECO mode.
#2: Temperature Control. Jag implemented some improvements concerning thermal management control, making greater use of the active radiator vane system. By closing the vanes more frequently, aerodynamic performance is enhanced.
#3: Battery Capacity. These updates now allow the battery to run at a lower state of charge without affecting drivability, durability or performance.
#4: Regenerative Braking. The system will now harvest more energy more efficiently when the battery is at a high state of charge, and the amount of energy recovery is increased at lower speeds for maximized efficiency and range.
#5: Range Estimation. Changes to the predictive range calculation algorithm deliver a more accurate and consistent estimate of vehicle range, according to Jaguar.
How To Receive The Free Jaguar I-PACE Updates
If you own a Jaguar I-PACE, they invite you to swing by your Jaguar retailer to receive the complimentary updates. If you’re thinking about getting yourself one for the holidays, new I-PACE vehicles come with the updates already, of course.
Just in case you need a refresher, the all-electric Jaguar I-PACE SUV starts at a very reasonable $69,500; is powered by a 90kWh lithium-ion battery offering a plenty quick zero to 60 mph time of 4.5 seconds; and provides 234 miles of all-electric range.

2019/12/06,2020 Mazda CX-30: More Muscular Mazda 3 Hits The Road,"The 2020 Mazda CX-30 was unveiled recently in Los Angeles.
Interior comfort was a focal point for Mazda’s designers.
All-wheel drive is available across the model range.
Mazda not only makes great-handling cars, but the Japanese company also knows a thing or two about crossovers and SUVs. The newest member of the family is the 2020 Mazda CX-30. It’s essentially a jacked-up Mazda 3 riding on the same chassis and suspension, with similar drivetrain components. It also slots nicely between the smaller CX-3 and larger CX-5.
The 2020 Mazda CX-30 made its cracking debut at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. Let’s dive deeper and see what Mazda is offering for the new CX-30.
2020 Mazda CX-30: Beautifully Proportioned
Since the Mazda CX-30 is based on the Mazda 3 (particularly the hatchback model), don’t be surprised if it ends up at the showroom looking pretty much like, well, a Mazda 3. But actually, the CX-30 is around 2.7 inches shorter than a Mazda 3 hatchback. This makes it easier to maneuver around town. And since it’s a crossover, the CX-30 is approximately four inches taller to give it the presence of an SUV.
We think the Mazda CX-30 looks better sorted than the Honda HR-V and Hyundai Kona. We also think the CX-30 is the antithesis of the new Kia Seltos, which is also a middle-ground candidate between the Soul and Sportage but with a boxier and more rugged attitude.

Thoughtful Cabin Touches
One of the great things about the new Mazda 3 is the utilization of better materials in the cabin, a trend which started in the revised Mazda CX-5. Sitting inside the CX-5 (and the new Mazda 3 in this regard) is akin to being in a BMW or Audi without paying a German price tag. This also holds true in the CX-30. The dashboard layout and steering wheel are also similar to the Mazda 3.
Every inch of the cabin was measured and optimized to create a quiet driving environment, says Mazda. However, careful attention was also placed on visibility. Mazda engineers went as far as minimizing the thickness of the A-pillars and C-pillars to reduce the risk of blind spots. Even the rear quarter window was designed in a way to minimize blind spots to the driver.

Is The 2020 Mazda CX-30 All-Wheel Drive?
All trim models of the 2020 Mazda CX-30 are motivated by a naturally-aspirated, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft. of torque; which is the same exact engine as the Mazda 3 sedan and hatchback. The 2.5-liter is mated to a six-speed automatic sending power to the front wheels. However, all-wheel-drive is a $1,400 option across the board.

Honestly, we’re pining heavily for Mazda’s Skyactiv-X engine to arrive stateside. We’re not sure how all of this translates in the CX-30, but the very same 2.5-liter engine felt a bit asthmatic in the new Mazda 3. Maybe it has something to do with the old-school six-speed gearbox, which is a shame since the CX-30 is only available with an automatic. But with Mazda’s off-road traction assist feature and standard G-Vectoring Control Plus, it has the smarts to conquer rough terrain and normal roads alike.

Safety & Connectivity Features
Standard on all CX-30 trim levels is Mazda’s i-Activesense package. It includes a number of advanced safety features like automatic high beams; adaptive cruise control; lane-keeping assist; and a drowsy driver monitoring system. Mazda Connected Services is also standard with a three-year free trial, along with a Wi-Fi hot spot complimentary for six months or 2GB.
How Much Is The 2020 Mazda CX-30?
The 2020 Mazda CX-30 is offered in four trim levels. The base CX-30 starts at $21,900 and includes an 8.8-inch center touchscreen display with HD Radio and Mazda Connect; Bluetooth connectivity; automatic LED headlamps; cloth seats; two USB ports; push-button start; 16-inch alloy wheels; and keyless entry. By comparison, the Mazda 3 sedan is only $400 less than a base model CX-30.
Next up is the CX-30 Select with a starting price of $23,900. This includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, keyless entry, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. Also standard is a leather steering wheel and shift knob; faux leather upholstery; dual-zone automatic climate control with rear vents; 18-inch alloy wheels; and rear privacy glass.

CX-30 Preferred & Premium
Meanwhile, the CX-30 Preferred starts at $26,200 and throws in a Bose 12-speaker premium audio system; power and heated front seats with memory functions; and SiriusXM complimentary for three months.
Last but not least is the CX-30 Premium starting at $28,200. It comes with a heads-up display; full leather upholstery; a power liftgate and moonroof; adaptive LED headlights; roof rails; paddle shifters; and a cylinder-deactivation system to help save fuel.

2019/12/04,2021 Kia Seltos: Son of Hercules Is a Strong One,"2021 Kia Seltos is the latest SUV in the automaker’s growing lineup.
The Seltos is available with all-wheel drive and torque vectoring.
Kia says it will hit the market during the first quarter of 2020.
Kia is on a roll with their SUVs these days. On the heels of the Telluride (which was released earlier this year) is the 2021 Kia Seltos compact SUV. The Seltos is a smidgen larger than the Soul but smaller than the Sportage. But unlike those two, the Seltos is obviously gifted with a marginal sprinkling of Telluride DNA.
Here’s a fun fact: The Seltos name is derived from Celtos, the son of Hercules in Greek mythology. In this case, Hercules is the Telluride, fresh off being named MotorTrend’s 2020 SUV of the Year, a title it grabbed from the Audi e-tron, Lincoln Aviator, Mercedes-Benz GLS, and Porsche Cayenne among others.
All The Boxy Goodness: Just Smaller
According to Kia’s press release, the Seltos is a “marriage of bold design and delicate details.” Now, I don’t know about that, but there’s a simpler way of explaining how the Seltos looks. It’s a smaller Telluride, and that’s that. And in that regard, the Seltos stands out from the absurdly distorted styling of direct rivals like the Toyota CH-R and the weirdly amusing Honda HR-V. This makes it more desirable for those who want traditional SUV styling cues from their small crossovers.
Similar to Telluride, the Seltos has a tall front end and an assertive appearance. Being a Kia, it also has a large tiger-nose grille and slimmer headlamps. It also has 7.2-inches of ground clearance and a thoughtful front/rear bumper design to enhance the approach angle when traversing off-road terrain. Being a bit larger than the Soul means a longer wheelbase and a more pronounced hood. Kia also gave the Seltos an optional two-tone roof for an added dose of sportiness and character.

What Type of Engine Does The Kia Seltos have?
The U.S.-bound Kia Seltos has two engine choices. The first is a naturally-aspirated 2.0-liter four-banger with 146 horsepower and 132 lb-ft. of torque. This engine is standard on the LX, S, and EX trim and is accompanied by a CVT transmission which Kia calls an IVT or Intelligent Variable Transmission.
Meanwhile, the next engine is a turbocharged 1.6-liter direct-injected mill, good for 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft. of torque. Standard in the Seltos S and SX, this engine is mated to a slick seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. If all this sounds familiar, you’re right on the money since you get the same engine choices in the equally striking Hyundai Kona.

Front-wheel drive is standard on the base model Seltos while Kia’s active, on-demand all-wheel drive system is optional across the board. It’s essentially the same AWD system from the Sportage with a center locking differential lifted from the Telluride. In addition, the AWD system also has a torque vectoring feature that feeds power to the wheels with most grip.

Roomy Interior
According to Kia, the new Seltos has the most interior volume in its class, and we don’t find that hard to believe. The Seltos does offer generous hip, shoulder, leg, and headroom for its size with enough space for five grown adults, according to the automaker. The rear seats, in particular, have a reclining feature for those longer trips. Also standard are rear air vents and USB charging ports for backseat passengers.
As an added bonus, the Seltos has a moveable rear luggage board to expand cargo space in the boot. And if you need to carry larger stuff, folding the rear seats and lifting the luggage board gives you a flat loading space to carry planks of wood, sports equipment, camping gear, and anything else you need.

The Kia Seltos Is Brimming With Technology
An eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system is standard while a larger 10-inch screen is optional with the navigation package. With this, you also get Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless charging, and an available Bose premium audio system with eight speakers.

Also available is a plethora of advanced driver-assistance features. Blind-spot collision warning, collision avoidance, driver attention warning, adaptive cruise control, and lane-keeping assist are either standard or optional depending on trim level.

How Much Is The 2021 Kia Seltos?
Unfortunately, Kia has yet to reveal all the base prices for the 2021 Seltos. We do know the Seltos will be offered in five trim models: LX, EX, S 1.0L, S 1.6T, and SX. According to Kia, the Seltos LX AWD will start at or below $22,000 while the S FWD is almost the same price. The 2021 Kia Seltos is slated to arrive in the first quarter of 2020.
I’m not the biggest crossover fan to be quite honest. But similar to how Kia blew us away with the all-conquering Telluride SUV (and the Stinger), the new Seltos is giving me second thoughts. Pending a proper test drive (attention Kia!), it’s safe to assume the Seltos is the most exciting (and off-road capable) compact SUV to arrive in a long while.

2019/12/03,2021 Jaguar F-Type: New In Velocity Blue But Still Red Hot!,"Jaguar pulled the cover off the 2021 F-Type recently.
Interior tech includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Two new 5.0-liter V8 engines join the 2021 F-Type lineup.
Pop quiz: What is the newest two-seat sports car, with a range of four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines; an eight-speed transmission, and 12-way Windsor Leather seats for First Edition models? If you said the 2021 Jaguar F-Type give yourself a high five. And if you already know the F-Type has won 178 awards to date, then your sports car knowledge is at a Beast Mode level.
It’s possible the 2021 F-Type may add a few more trophies to the shelf. It certainly looks the part, and with upgraded engines and a new interior for 2021, the sky is the limit for the 2021 Jaguar F-Type. At the moment though, we simply love that Velocity Blue paint job!
What Is The 2021 Jaguar F-Type?
The 2021 F-Type is the latest in a lineage spanning more than seven decades. The world was first introduced to the XK120 during the Earls Court Motor Show in October of 1948, the 120 designation carrying a special connotation. The XK120 could hit 120 mph and was, at the time, the world’s fastest production car.
Earlier this year, Jaguar unveiled the Checkered Flag F-Type, a limited-edition model with two engine choices. Now the British automaker is coming to town with the 2021 F-Type, a car they say breaks the mold in every way.
“Design the most beautiful sports car, with purity, proportion, and presence that’s unmistakably Jaguar: that was the challenge we set for ourselves,” explained Julian Thomson, Jaguar’s Design Director. “The new F-Type is more dramatic than ever, with even greater clarity of purpose in every line, surface and feature, and embodies true Jaguar design DNA.”

What Engines Does The 2021 F-Type Have?
There are four total: The 300PS four-cylinder turbo; 380PS supercharged V6; and two V8 engines: the 450PS and 575PS. Each engine is married to Jaguar’s eight-speed, Quickshift transmission. The calibrations are taken directly from the XE SV Project 8.
The powertrain lineup for the 2021 Jaguar F-Type is market-dependent, however. Here is how things shake out:
China: 300PS four-cylinder, 380PS V6.
UK, EU: 300PS four-cylinder, 450PS V8, 575PS V8.
North America: 300PS four-cylinder, 380PS V6, 575PS V8.
Select Overseas Markets: 300PS four-cylinder, 450PS V8, 575PS V8.
Remainder of the Global Markets: 300PS four-cylinder, 380PS V6, 575PS V8.
Close-coupled particulate filters help reduce the emissions of each engine. An active exhaust system provides a distinctive “crackle and pop” sound in Dynamic mode according to Jaguar. In the chassis department, the 2021 F-Type receives new adaptive dampers, springs, anti-roll bars, plus stiffer rear knuckles and ball joints.

Is The 2021 Jaguar F-Type All-Wheel Drive?
Yes, it has the option for all-wheel drive although some models only offer rear-wheel drive. Here is how the lineup will look in terms of availability:
2021 F-Type Coupé & Convertible
300PS 2.0-liter four-cylinder: RWD only
380PS 3.0-liter V6: RWD or AWD
450PS 5.0-liter V8: RWD or AWD
2021 F-Type R-Dynamic Coupé & Convertible
300PS 2.0-liter four-cylinder: RWD only
380PS 3.0-liter V6: RWD or AWD
450PS 5.0-liter V8: RWD or AWD
2021 F-Type First Edition Coupé & Convertible
300PS 2.0-liter four-cylinder: RWD only
380PS 3.0-liter V6: RWD or AWD
450PS 5.0-liter V8: RWD or AWD
The F-Type First Edition will be available for just one year. The car’s Exterior Design Pack includes special treatments like five-spoke, 20-inch wheels in Gloss Technical Grey with a contrasting Diamond-Turned finish. On the inside, First Edition models see 12-way Windsor Leather performance seats with monogram stitching.

2021 Jaguar F-Type: Examining The Engines
The 2.0-liter four-cylinder returns to the F-Type lineup and creates 296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque. By comparison, the 380PS supercharged V6 produces 380 horsepower and 339 lb-ft. of torque, although that engine carries over largely unchanged for 2021 as well. While the four-cylinder and V6 have their place, enthusiasts many want to lean toward the new, more powerful V8 engines.
“The range of powertrains offers a breadth of choice unrivaled in the segment,” said Alan Volkaerts, Vehicle Line Director, Jaguar F-Type. “Enthusiasts will appreciate the new F-Type R’s 575PS supercharged V8, enhanced chassis and intelligent all-wheel drive system, which deliver truly outstanding performance in all conditions while retaining its inherent tractability and usability.”
The supercharged 450PS 5.0-liter V8 spits out 450 horsepower and 427 lb-ft. of torque at 2,500 rpm. Be it rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, this version of the 5.0-liter hits 60 in 4.4 seconds and tops out at 177. The 575PS V8 (also a 5.0-liter displacement) is the bigger dog in the pound and reserved accordingly for the F-Type R. With 575 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. of torque, this supercharged V8 reaches 60 in 3.5 seconds and boasts a top speed of 186.
“Jaguar has been making sports cars for more than 70 years, and that rich heritage has inspired the team to create something truly extraordinary,” Thomson added.
“The new F-Type is the definitive Jaguar sports car and continues to set the benchmark for design purity,” said Alan Volkaerts, Vehicle Line Director, Jaguar F-Type. Photo: Jaguar Land Rover.
Exterior Design: Calligraphy J Lights
Jaguar says their goal was a more sculpted look for the 2021 F-Type. Designers focused on illumination as much as anything else. The new F-Type’s LED headlights, rear lights, turn signals, and the signature “Calligraphy J” daytime running lights were given lots of attention. Jaguar says they worked specifically to blend these items into the “liquid metal” surfacing of the F-Type’s body.

“The new F-Type is the definitive Jaguar sports car and continues to set the benchmark for design purity,” Volkaerts said. “Its timeless looks are more assertive than ever.”
Windsor Leather & Noble Chrome
Drivers are treated to Windsor Leather, Noble Chrome finishes, and monogram stitching across the seats and door trims. The center console, glovebox, and seat belts include a special “Jaguar Est. 1935” insignia. A 12.3-inch TFT display, Touch Pro infotainment system, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Baidu CarLife are among the modern conveniences. The 2021 Jaguar F-Type can even receive over-the-air software updates.
“State-of-the-art technologies together with luxurious materials and finishes deliver beauty with purpose in an interior which will delight driver and passenger alike even before the engine starts and the journey begins,” Thomson said.

When Will The 2021 Jaguar F-Type Be Available?
The 2021 Jaguar F-Type is available for order currently, with a starting price of £54,060 in the UK (about $60,000 USD). In terms of when the new F-Type will land at dealers, Jaguar did not specify (assume it will arrive at some point next year).
The 2021 Jaguar F-Type is built at the automaker’s Castle Bromwich plant in the UK.

2019/11/29,2020 Nissan Rogue Sport: Brief But Detailed Walk Around,"The 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport is a little more stylish than the average Rogue.
Front-wheel drive is standard for the Sport, although all-wheel drive is available.
Starting MSRP is reasonable and the Rogue Sports offers a good value for the money.
The 2020 Rogue Sport is arriving at Nissan dealerships as we speak. The Rogue, in general, is nicely set apart from the rest of Nissan’s SUV lineup. Not small as small as the Kicks, but not nearly as massive as the Armada, the 2020 Rogue seats five and has three trim levels: S, SV, and SL. The Sport trim adds a little extra flair without going overboard on price.
How Much Is The 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport?
Rogue Sport S FWD $23,240

Rogue Sport SL FWD $28,450

Is The 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport All-Wheel Drive?
Although front-wheel drive is standard, the 2020 Rogue Sport is available with all-wheel drive. The system, dubbed by Nissan as “Intelligent All-Wheel Drive,” initially delivers power to both front and rear wheels for better traction. Once up to speed, power is sent strictly to the front wheels in the interest of fuel economy. Around corners and during bad weather, power is balanced from front to rear, up to a 50:50 mix.

What Engine Does The 2020 Rogue Sport Have?
The 2020 Rogue Sport is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 141 horsepower and 147 lb-ft. of torque.

The engine pairs with an Xtronic transmission with an Eco Mode switch. Fuel economy for front-wheel drive models comes in at 25/32 city/highway and 28 combined. All-wheel drive variants, by comparison, are 24/30 city/highway and 27 combined.

Technology & Connectivity
Everything is run through a seven-inch touchscreen display with Bluetooth capability. Standard is a four-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system with an auxiliary input jack, and a USB connection port for an iPod. However, music lovers may want to opt for the Bose premium stereo.

2019/11/28,2020 Genesis G90: It’s a Whole Lot of Car,"The 2020 Genesis G90 underwent a number of changes for the new model year.
New design themes are present along with a host of standard safety features.
Two different engines are on offer for the 2020 Genesis G90, including a V8.
We’ve been hearing rumors of a Genesis SUV concept for quite a while. Instead, Genesis presented the 2020 G90 at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The G90 is not an SUV, but the market for sedans is not dead as some analysts and automakers want us to believe. Despite the growing SUV and crossover market, 78 percent of people surveyed by Edelman Intelligence would consider purchasing a sedan. Moreover, U.S. sedan owners are just as satisfied with their cars as non-sedan owners.
And while the G90 is not an SUV, it happens to be a lot of car for the price.
What Is The Genesis G90?
The 2020 Genesis G90 is a full-size luxury sedan. In case you’re not aware, Genesis is the luxury arm of parent company Hyundai for the North American market. It’s kind of like how Lexus is to Toyota and Honda is to Acura. However, the 2020 G90 is not an all-new model. It’s still part of the first-generation G90 introduced back in 2017, so it retains the same components and drivetrain underneath.
Looking at it, though, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s an all-new model. Mind you, this happens to be the first significant update to the original G90 since arriving in the U.S., and we like what we’re seeing.
How Much Does The 2020 Genesis G90 Cost?
2020 Genesis G90: Starting MSRP
*Dollar figures reflect $995 destination charge
Trim Starting MSRP
3.3T Premium RWD $73,195
3.3T Premium AWD $75,695
5.0L Ultimate RWD $76,695
5.0L Ultimate AWD $79,195
Affordable Luxury
Affordable luxury is a real thing in the modern world. Hyundai (and Kia) employed the same tactics to carve out a niche in the auto industry, and did so by offering a better value for the money. It’s the same story with Genesis. Want a solid BMW 3-Series competitor without paying a German price tag? Unless you’re already smitten by the Italian charm of Alfa Romeo’s Giulia Quadrifoglio, the Genesis G70 is the best compact luxury sport sedan for the money.
However, the 2020 Genesis G90 is aiming straight at the BMW 7-Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. It’s also grabbing the jugular of Lexus’ flagship LS sedan, a car that gave Lexus a permanent foothold in the luxury segment. As you can see, the Genesis G90 is not exactly treading over shallow waters, but it remains an unpretentious (and yes, more affordable) choice if road comfort is your top priority.

The Genesis G90 Has The Right Team
Hmm, the restyled 2020 Genesis G90 looks familiar, right? We’re seeing hints of Bentley, Cadillac, and a sprinkling of Volvo design, the latter of which is most evident in those gorgeous yet rather intimidating quad-headlamps.
This is not at all surprising given Genesis had the right blokes for the job.
Hyundai’s Executive Vice President and Chief Design Officer, Luc Donckerwolke, used to pen for Bentley. “G90 is the ultimate expression of the Genesis brand,” he said. “Before the first sketch was even drawn, my team of designers thought carefully about how to evolve its styling and create something even more elegant and harmonic.” Also, Filippo Perini recently joined Genesis as Chief Designer at the brand’s advanced design studio in Europe, a man who used to work for Lamborghini, Audi, Italdesign, and Alfa Romeo. This gives the new G90 rock-solid credibility in terms of styling, and it shows.

2020 Genesis G90: Revamped Exterior Styling
Did you notice the new signature front grille? Genesis calls it a Crest Grille with an open-mesh design, and it’s an example of how a large grille should look in a luxury sedan. It has none of the hideousness of Lexus’ spindle grille, and it definitely looks more dignified than what BMW did for its 4-Series Concept car. The G90 also receives a new hood; some funky horizontal lower ducting in the front bumper; those aforementioned quad-headlights; and bolder front fenders with larger fake vents (sigh); and unique light strips (yay) which visually extend the shape of the headlights to the sides of the vehicle.
Related: Cars.com pits the Genesis G70 against the BMW 3 Series.
Out back, the 2020 Genesis G90 receives an integrated ducktail spoiler; reshaped bumper; and a pair of exhaust tips mimicking the crest-inspired design of the front grille. The car also has quad taillights and a horizontal light bar running the entire width of the vehicle. Overall, the exterior makeover is meant to give the vehicle a sleeker, lower, and more progressive vibe.

Turbo V6 or Naturally-Aspirated V8 Power
Similar to the outgoing Genesis G90, the new model retains the turbocharged V6 and naturally-aspirated V8. The V6 is a 3.3-liter unit found in the Kia Stinger producing the same 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft. of torque. On the other hand, the G90 Ultimate is motivated by a 5.0-liter V8 with 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft. of torque.
Both engines are connected to an eight-speed automatic gearbox feeding power to the rear wheels. However, both the V6 and V8 are available with all-wheel drive for an additional $2,500.

2020 Genesis G90: Refined Interior
Perhaps our biggest complaint with the outgoing Genesis G90 is the presence of cheap-looking materials and buttons inside. Thankfully, Genesis addressed our concerns with more premium materials, including chrome-plated switches and premium leather surfaces. Also, the new 12.3-inch infotainment display is now a proper touchscreen. It can support over the air updates for maps and software, along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
And since luxury cars need to be as quiet as a library, Genesis gave the new G90 an active noise cancellation system. From there, the G90 is standard with an adaptive control suspension to help smooth out bumpy roads.

Enhanced Safety Features
The 2020 Genesis G90 adds a slew of advanced driver assistance systems and safety features. Along with ten standard airbags (including a passenger-side knee airbag), the new G90 has lane following assist; rear cross-traffic collision avoidance assist; forward collision avoidance assist; safety exit assist; and highway driving assist.

2019/11/22,2021 Chevy Trailblazer: Not The K5 But Still Okay,"2021 Chevy Trailblazer will have new turbo engines.
A more rugged and sporty ACTIV trim joins the lineup.
Pricing for the new Trailblazer will start under $20,000.
While it’s not the Blazer we remember (K5!), Chevy says the new Trailblazer provides a youthful yet functional alternative for prospective buyers. “Slotting between the Trax and Equinox, the addition of the Trailblazer provides us with a great opportunity to expand the Chevy SUV family to new audiences,” said Steve Majoros, Director of Chevrolet Passenger Car and Crossover Marketing.
What Is The Chevy Trailblazer?
The original Chevy Blazer hit the market in 1969, and ran uninterrupted until the Tahoe came to town in 1995. The nameplate was revived in 2002 – this time as the Trailblazer – and lived a fruitful life until 2009 when the Traverse up and kicked it out of the barn. Now a decade later, the Trailblazer gets a new lease on life with a modern design, a nice array of technology and safety features, and seating for up to five.
What Does The 2021 Chevy Trailblazer Cost?
Pricing will begin under $20,000 says Chevrolet. The RS and ACTIV trims will likely start in the mid-$20,000 range according to the Detroit News.

What Engine Does The Chevy Trail Blazer Have?
Under the hood are two different turbo engines for 2021. The first is a 1.2-liter turbo followed by a slightly larger 1.3-liter turbo. Chevy has not given any other specifics, only saying the 2021 Trailblazer will create up to 155 horsepower. Both engines come standard with a Continuously Variable Transmission with stop/start capability. A nine-speed automatic is available for the 1.3-liter engine with all-wheel drive.
With an all-wheel drive 2021 Trailblazer, drivers can decide when to activate the system, say while off-road or during inclement weather. The selectable system can be switched on when necessary, and off in the interest of fuel economy. Front-wheel drive Trailblazers have their own drive modes: Normal, Snow, and Sport.
For the current 2020 TrailBlazer, there are three engines: an Ecotec 2.5-liter, a 2.0-liter turbo, and a 3.6-liter V6. The latter creates 308 horsepower.
2021 Chevy Trailblazer RS. Photo: Chevrolet.
What Are The Standard Safety Features?
All Trailblazer models come with a comprehensive list of active safety and driver assistance features, including: Forward Collision Alert; Automatic Emergency Braking; Front Pedestrian Braking; IntelliBeam Headlamps (Auto High Beam Assist); Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning; Rear Vision Camera; and Rear Seat Reminder.
Parents with younger drivers might appreciate the capabilities of Chevy’s Teen Driver system. Optional safety features include Adaptive Cruise Control; Rear Park Assist; Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert; Rear Cross Traffic Alert; and HD Rear Vision Camera.

The Trailblazer ACTIV is a more rugged and sporty variant. ACTIV models receive special front and rear fascias; dual exhaust; and a few suspension tweaks and enhancements. The Hankook Sport Terrain 17-inch tires have an aggressive shoulder design and an all-season tread pattern.
Complementing the ACTIV in the style department is the RS, with a performance-inspired mesh grille, unique front splitter, and a black Chevy bowtie. Both the RS and ACTIV come standard with a two-tone roof and large, wraparound taillamps.

Interior Treatments
Depending on the trim level, the interior finishes will look different, but overall the 2021 Chevy Trailblazer should be nice inside. The center console is flexible with up to 3.5 liters of open storage, and and another 4.4 liters under the armrest.
The 40/60 split folding second row enables the vehicle to accommodate objects up to 8.5 feet long. Overall storage capacity comes in around 54.4 cubic feet with the second row folded. A hands-free liftgate is available to make loading easier.
On the tech and connectivity side, the 2021 Chevy Trailblazer has the option for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto along with Sirius XM. OnStar4 is standard.

2019/11/22,Tesla Cybertruck: The Future of Trucks? We’re Not Sure But We Like It,"The Tesla Cybertruck is the automaker’s first pickup.
Three different trim levels and powertrains are on offer.
It has a bulletproof body and shatter resistant glass. Sort of.
Lo and behold, the Tesla Cybertruck is here. And already, the internet is abuzz with all sorts of blabber, which mostly have to do with the bold, daring, and frankly brilliant cyberpunk design. It’s like a stealth fighter for the road but with big wheels and an all-conquering demeanor.
Since we’re talking about Tesla and Elon Musk, the new Cybertruck is more than a pickup. It’s an armored fortress with enough room for six adults. I’m betting Musk did this on purpose, by which I mean to create a new generation of pickups by throwing everything we know about them out the window. In short, it’s everything a truck should be.
A Slight Disclaimer
We’re not exactly Tesla fanatics or Elon fanboys. We’re just ordinary car guys who happen to appreciate what Tesla is doing at the moment. All systems are a go for the Model 3 and incoming Model Y, and Musk is probably busy tuning the rocket thrusters on the new Roadster right about now, which is also arriving sometime next year.
But my gosh, Tesla really nailed it with the Cybertruck. Honestly, it’s what America has been looking for in an electric vehicle.

What Is The Tesla Cybertruck?
The Cybertruck is Tesla’s first attempt at building a new pickup. Standard features include Autopilot, an adjustable air suspension, 16-inches of maximum ground clearance, and a rather useful 6.5-foot bed. You also get 100V and 220V outlets and an on-board air compressor. The Cybertruck will come in three variants: Single Motor Rear-Wheel Drive, Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive, and Tri Motor All-Wheel Drive.
The Cybertruck is more than just a wedge-shaped slab of brute strength and cyberpunk goodness. If you look underneath, the construction is akin to building a jet-powered aircraft. Unlike traditional pickups, the Cybertruck is constructed from a revolutionary exoskeleton. You see, conventional wisdom suggests a body-on-frame construction, but Musk wanted a different approach.

Space Age Design
In a traditional ladder frame, the body and bed are essentially lugged around by the chassis. And as Musk said at the unveiling in Hawthorne, California, trucks haven’t changed much in the last hundred years, and the heavy body is comparable to carrying a sack of potatoes. This is the reason why Ford when to an all-aluminum body in 2015 for the F-150: to cut weight by up to 700 lbs. in certain configurations. Since then, GM and Ram have followed suit with their own weight reduction measures.

So, what should an innovative company like Tesla do at this point? The Tesla boffins created an exoskeleton from 30x cold-rolled steel alloy, the same material utilized in Space X’s Mars rocket prototype. This design not only distributes the stress equally within the body itself, but it frees up space for more interior room.

Bulletproof Body & Shatter-Proof Glass
During the reveal, Musk had Tesla lead designer Franz von Holzhausen smash the driver’s door with a sledgehammer. If you were watching the live video feed, then you know the door was neither dented nor scarred. It was slightly misaligned at the door jamb, but the point is those nasty dents and dings won’t bother you again.
Oh, and those body panels are rigid enough to resist a 9mm bullet.
Musk also debuted Tesla Armor Glass for the first time, which the company calls a “transparent metal.” This essentially means the glass is exponentially stronger than ordinary automotive glass. Or at least in theory.
However, when Elon Musk asked von Holzhausen to try and break the driver’s side window using a heavy metal ball, things didn’t go exactly as planned. The metal ball managed to break the window! However, it didn’t go through to the interior, which is still impressive when you think about it. “Ah, there’s room for improvement,” Musk said on stage, later offering this explanation for why the windows shattered.
The Tesla Cybertruck will have a starting price of $39,900. Photo: Tesla Motors.
How Much Will The Tesla Cybertruck Cost?
The Cybertruck is sold in three models. The base has a single electric motor and rear-wheel drive with an average range of 250 miles. This model has a 3,500 lbs. payload limit and a maximum tow rating of 7,500 lbs., not bad for a starting price of $39,900.
The mid-tier model has dual electric motors and all-wheel drive with a range of 300 miles. It accelerates from zero to hero in 4.5 seconds. With a maximum tow rating around 10,000 lbs., this model is practically a steal at $49,900.
The real daddy is the tri-motor, all-wheel drive version with a 500-mile battery pack and up to 14,000 lbs. towing capacity. If you think this setup is related to Tesla’s Plaid Model S roaming around the Nürburgring, you’re right. With three electric motors, the Cybertruck shatters the 60 mph mark in 2.9 seconds and completes a quarter-mile run in 10.8 seconds. By the numbers, the Cybertruck accelerates faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo, but it’s not cheap. Pricing starts at $69,900.

When Will The Tesla Cybertruck Be Available?
Tesla is currently accepting reservations for the Cybertruck, with production starting in late 2021. The tri-motor, all-wheel drive Cybertruck arrives near the end of 2022.

2019/11/21,2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel: An In-Depth Look Under The Hood,"The 2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel is on its way to dealers.
Jeep says the models are in response to consumer demand.
The new EcoDiesel has some pretty cool features to boost torque.
Well this is . . . weird. Why, in this day and age, would Jeep make a diesel? Things are going greener by the day. Car companies that were heavily into diesels are going the EV way instead, and the writing may be on the wall already for gas-powered engines. The only thing I can think of is how the 2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel would make the perfect post-apocalyptic ride when the planet runs out of gas.
Oh wait, I see why they made it. It’s right there in the specs: 442 lb-ft. of torque. Well that’s 442 good reasons right there. Officially, however, Jeep says overwhelming consumer demand is what prompted them to drop the EcoDiesel in the Wrangler. Assuming you’re taking your Jeep off-road, the more torque, the better, right? I mean, you’re going to have to pull yourself out of bogs and ruts and up steep snow-covered ravines and whatnot, so torque is your friend.
Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel: How It’s Equipped
For 2020, all Wrangler four-door models will give you the choice of a new 3.0-liter EcoDiesel V6. This diesel-burning plant puts out 260 horsepower (not bad) and 442 lb-ft. of torque (fabulous!). The drivetrain also has a stop-start feature standard, so you’ll get even better mileage. The Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel can be had in Sport, Sahara, and Rubicon flavors. Jeep says they will go on sale in the fourth quarter of this year.
This is the third generation of FCA’s 3.0-liter EcoDiesel. Jeep has worked it over to assure minimal levels of noise, vibration and harshness, while also increasing power and fuel economy. The diesel mill has a compacted graphite iron block; forged steel crankshaft and con rods; aluminum alloy pistons; and heat-treated aluminum cylinder heads with individual bearing caps. The EcoDiesel has dual overhead camshafts with four valves per cylinder and a 60-degree angle between the cylinder banks.

2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel: Diving Deeper
There’s a bunch of significant changes that impact the new EcoDiesel’s performance. First off, there’s a new water-cooled turbocharger with a variable geometry turbine. A low-friction bearing increases efficiency and responsiveness during transient conditions (e.g. when you’re modulating the throttle a lot). Jeep redesigned the cylinder head intake ports for higher flow to increase performance and fuel economy. The exhaust gas re-circulation system was updated as well to a dual-loop system, meaning both low and high pressure. According to Jeep, the added low-pressure circulation system draws gases after the diesel particulate filter to aid fuel economy.

The compression ratio was decreased to 16.0:1 from 16.5:1 for – you guessed it – better fuel economy. The fuel injector nozzles were redesigned for higher pressures (29,000 psi/2,000 bar) and to better match the new combustion chamber. Elsewhere under the hood, the pistons are lightweight aluminum alloy jobs with thinner rings and a low-friction, diamond-like carbon coating to cut parasitic loss. Jeep even went so far as to offset the piston pin by 0.3 millimeters from the center line to work the NVH numbers even lower.
Okay Jeep, we get it: This guy is the strong but silent type. Jeep even reworked and improved the vacuum pump system (there’s two of them) with new blades.
The EcoDiesel, now available for the 2020 Jeep Wrangler, was on of Wards 10 Best Engines for three consecutive years (2014, 2015, 2016). Photo: FCA US LLC.
Transmission & Transfer Case Tech
All EcoDiesel Jeeps come with a new TorqueFlite 8HP75 eight-speed automatic to handle the greater torque load. This new gearbox is calibrated for lower RPM shifts, as well as the off-road rigors Jeeps are commonly subjected to. There are more than 40 individual shift maps to optimize shift points for fuel economy, performance, and 4×4 capability. Good job Jeep!
In case you missed it: six awesome concepts from the 2019 Easter Jeep Safari.
The 2020 Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel uses third-gen Dana 44, front and rear, heavy-duty axles. All Wrangler EcoDiesels feature a 3.73 axle ratio with two transfer cases: the Rock-Trac two-speed case with a 4.0:1 low-range gear ratio (Rubicon models); and the Command-Trac part-time two-speed case with a 2.72:1 low-range gear ratio on Sport and Sahara models.

Does The Jeep Wrangler EcoDiesel Use DEF?
A 5.1-gallon diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) tank is located just behind the fuel tank, with the filler port next to where you put in the diesel fuel. Jeep says you’ll have to refill the DEF when you change your oil, which should be up to 10,000 miles. Impressive. Just in case you don’t trust that, levels are monitored via the new DEF gauge in the front cluster.

2019/11/20,Mustang Mach-E: An Inside Look At What All The Buzz Is About,"The Ford Mustang Mach-E is an all-electric SUV inspired by the famous pony car.
Engineers developed a new, purpose-built vehicle architecture to house the battery.
Forthcoming performance variants of the Mustang Mach-E will have more horsepower.
Well before the buzz started, the Ford Mustang Mach-E was being developed in a century-old brick building a few blocks away from Henry Ford’s original factory in Detroit. Ford is expanding the Mustang nameplate for the first time in over five decades, and hoping the Mach-E will make a lasting impact when it arrives in late 2020.
“At the first-ever Detroit auto show, Henry Ford said he was working on something that would strike like forked lightning,” said Bill Ford, Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company. “That was the Model T. Today, the Ford Motor Company is proud to unveil a car that strikes like forked lightning all over again. The all-new, all-electric Mustang Mach-E.”
What Is The Ford Mustang Mach-E?
The Mustang Mach-E is a new, all-electric SUV inspired by Ford’s famous pony car. Powered by permanent magnet motors, the Mustang Mach-E comes with standard and extended-range battery options with either rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. The Mustang Mach-E can receive over-the-air updates as they become available in order to improve performance over time.
Beyond the over-the-air updates, Ford says they have more than 2,100 EV-certified dealers and more than 3,500 EV-trained technician nationwide.

What Is The Range of The Mustang Mach-E?
With an extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive, Ford is after an EPA-estimated range of at least 300 miles. The Ford Connected Charging station adds an estimated average range of 32 miles per charging hour on a 240V outlet (extended-range, rear-wheel drive model). The Ford mobile charger, included with the Mach-E, adds an estimated average range of 22 miles per charging hour on a 240V outlet.
With a peak charging rate of 150 kW, the Mustang Mach-E with an extended battery and rear-wheel drive can add an estimated average range of 47 miles in approximately 10 minutes via a DC fast charging station. The standard-range battery is estimated to charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in approximately 38 minutes through a DC fast charging station.

How Much Power Does The Mustang Mach-E Have?
In extended-range all-wheel-drive, Ford is projecting 332 horsepower and 417 lb-ft. of torque. While it appears obvious Ford is after Tesla with the Mustang Mach-E, their immediate benchmark was actually Porsche. In an all-wheel drive configuration, Ford says they are aiming for better zero to 60 times than the base Porsche Macan. As one might expect with anything Mustang, the Mach-E will also have two higher-performance variants.
The Mustang Mach-E GT is targeting a zero to 60 time under four seconds, giving it an edge over the Porsche Macan Turbo. Meanwhile, the GT Performance Edition is seeking a zero to 60 time in the mid-three second range to rival the 911 GTS. Ford says, based on their computer and engineering simulations, both GT variants produce around 459 horsepower and 612 lb-ft. of torque.
“The Mustang Mach-E wholeheartedly rejects the notion that electric vehicles are only good at reducing gas consumption,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s Chief Product Development and Purchasing Officer. “People want a car that’s thrilling to drive, that looks gorgeous, and that can easily adapt to their lifestyle – and the Mustang Mach-E delivers all of this in unmatched style.”

Battery Testing & Placement
Ford’s designers and engineers faced a number of challenges with the battery, including performance and placement. Using a new, purpose-built electric architecture, the battery resides on the floor between the Mustang Mach-E’s two axles. Ford says the placement minimizes cabin intrusion to allow for seating up to five, while also making it easier to assemble on the line.
Engineers worked the battery over in a battery of tests, some in temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The Mustang Mach-E’s battery is secured inside a specially-constructed waterproof case surrounded by crash-absorption material. They are liquid-cooled to optimize performance in extreme weather and to improve charging times.
The standard-range Mustang Mach-E uses a 75.7 kWh lithium-ion battery (288 lithium-ion cells) while the extended-range model employs a 98.8 kWh battery (376 lithium-ion cells).

Drive Modes & Mach-E 4
The Mach-E is the first production vehicle tuned by the Ford Performance team with the company’s racing simulator in North Carolina. From those sessions came the “Mach-E 4” all-wheel drive system, which Ford tested in a number of wet, slippery, and snowy conditions. Mach-E 4 applies torque independently to the front and rear axles for better handling and acceleration.
Depending on a driver’s mood, the Mustang Mach-E provides three different modes: Whisper, Engage, and Unbridled. They all seem fairly obvious as to what they do and it seems fairly obvious which one we would like. Each mode changes things with the Mustang Mach-E accordingly, from the steering and powertrain response, to the ambient lights and instrument cluster animations.
“Whether you want to really feel its performance capability or are looking for the quiet atmosphere that electric vehicles can offer, the Mach-E harnesses the power of electrification to create a unique driving experience while retaining that unmistakable Mustang feeling of freedom,” said Ted Cannis, Ford Enterprise Product Line Director, Global Electrification.

Mustang Mach-E: Braking & Suspension
The Mustang Mach-E will be available with Brembo’s new Flexira aluminum calipers, which combine the functionality of a fixed caliper with the dimensions of a floating one. The GT Performance Edition comes with Ford’s MagneRide damping system.

Mustang Mach-E: On The Inside
Classic Mustang design cues like the double-cowl instrument panel are seen throughout the interior. Those traditional cues compliment the greener ones, like the available panoramic fixed-glass roof. It has a special coating with infrared protection to keep things cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. In addition, an inner layer between the glass protects against UV rays.
Through a 15.5-inch touchscreen, drivers can access all the Mach-E’s functions and features using touch, swipe, and pinch controls. The touchscreen houses Ford’s new SYNC system with machine learning.
“Next-generation SYNC actively starts adapting to you as soon as you start using it, quickly learning your preferences and making personalized suggestions,” said Darren Palmer, Ford Global Director for Battery Electric Vehicles. “It can suggest going to the gym if it learns Mondays are workout days or calling home if you do that every day after work.”
Cargo & Storage Capacity
The rear trunk offers 29 cubic feet of space, increasing to 59.6 cubic feet of space with the rear seats down. By comparison, the front trunk provides 4.8 cubic feet of storage, enough for a carry-on bag. And get this: the front trunk has a drain, so owners can pack it full of ice and head to the tailgate party before the game.

When Will The Mustang Mach-E Be Available?
Ford is taking orders via the Mustang Mach-E reservation site with a $500.00 deposit. A special First Edition in extended-range all-wheel drive will be available. The First Edition Mustang Mach-E comes with red brake calipers, metallic pedal covers, contrast seat stitching, and a scuff plate marked First Edition. Ford says the Mustang Mach-E will begin arriving at dealers late next year, although some models may not arrive until the spring of 2021.

2019/11/16,2020 Bentley Flying Spur: This Grand Tourer Is Still Grand,"The 2020 Bentley Flying Spur is still one of the most luxurious cars in the world.
Enhanced version of Bentley’s W12 twin-turbo engine powers the Flying Spur.
Nearly an endless number of bespoke and custom treatments are available.
Bentley’s Flying Spur, the company’s big cruiser of the ville, is completely new for 2020. How new? The Crewe outfit puts it this way: “The third generation of Bentley’s luxury four-door Grand Tourer owes only its name to its predecessor.” That new. And will you just look at this thing! I mean, it looks like it’s 23 feet long, 68 inches wide, and weighs comparable to a railroad carriage (that it can probably out haul).
Turns out, The 2020 Bentley Flying Spur weighs 5,373 lbs., or about 2.44 Miatas.
The new Flying Spur delivers sports sedan agility and modern limousine refinement, quoth Bentley. Upon hearing that, Colin Chapman rose from his grave and was seen shambling in the direction of Bentley H.Q. Look, guys, your ride has got a lot going for it, but let’s not try to say “has agility” is in the plus column, ‘K?
What Engine Does The Flying Spur Have?
What it does have is a well-honed sense of refinement and luxury, and a serious helping of sumptuous sophistication. Oh, and enough power to put a pound of bacon in orbit around Saturn. That part comes from an enhanced version of the Flying Spur’s 6.0-liter, twin-turbo W12 engine with variable displacement and high and low pressure direct injection. The Flying Spur also uses the same eight-speed ZF dual-clutch transmission as the Continental GT.
Bentley says maximum torque is available in less than a third of the time versus the previous Flying Spur. This is good enough for a top speed of 207 mph, and a zero to 60 mph time of 3.7 seconds. In other words, it has enough grunt to pull the Ark Royal out of a dry dock.

The Flying Spur Seems To Have It All
From the retractable ‘Flying B’ mascot on its proscenium-sized nose; to the pool-table-scope trunk lid; and through the vast cabin between, the 2020 Flying Spur is laden with expensive and heavy appointments. Even the door inserts receive a three-dimensional and diamond-quilted treatment.
Related: Every Bentley fan needs this book.
“Optimal comfort and style are delivered by new-design fluted leather seats, which feature diamond quilting for the Mulliner Driving Specification,” says Bentley in their press materials. See, you’re not just comfortable in a new Flying Spur, you’re optimally comfortable.

And There’s More . . .
As you would reckon, Bentley takes this idea to the extreme. For example, the detachable Touch Screen Remote Control that can operate all the vehicle’s major functions is the “centerpiece of the rear seat experience.” The panoramic glass sunroof stretches the full length of the Flying Spur, while the mood lighting helps if the view of the sky is not to your liking on a given day.
The superlative audio system (you know, the stereo) is a 2,200-watt Naim outfit that literally puts out more power than Pete Townshend’s triple Hiwatt stack.
Advanced connectivity features? Check. Cutting-edge driver assistance systems? Yup. Night Vision infrared camera? Don’t even ask. Traffic Assist? Sure. Heads-up display? Mei bien sur. Along with electronic all-wheel steering, all-wheel drive, and Bentley’s Dynamic Ride technology, a 48-volt electric anti-roll system with three-chamber air springs.

Bentley Flying Spur: Testing & Development
And if attaching the name Bentley to that much tech isn’t enough, the company tested the bejeebers out of the 2020 Flying Spur to make sure it would all work. The new Flying Spur covered over one million miles with 142 different prototype and pre-production test cars. Of the million miles, 507,000 of them were done on public roads and another 7,460 were done at the Flying Spur’s top speed of 207 mph.
Related: “To build a fast car, a good car, the best in its class.” The story of W.O. Bentley.
In total, Bentley’s engineers went to 18 countries, toured across four continents, and worked in both subzero and scorching temperatures alike. “The most advanced Bentley ever built,” they say of the new Flying Spur. And who am I to argue with them?

How Much Is The 2020 Bentley Flying Spur?
Plan for at least $220,000 for your new Flying Spur. However, dear boy, you must know that each Flying Spur can be uniquely configured. A wide selection of exterior and interior paint colors; leather hides and wood veneers and contrast stitching; a nearly endless array of personalized options through Mulliner.
They say a Bentley is the most bespoke car in the word. And who am I to argue with them?

2019/11/15,2020 Hyundai Sonata: All The Details (With Some Liquid Chrome),"The 2020 Sonata is a great value for sedan buyers.
Trim levels are well-equipped, even the entry-level SE.
Gas mileage increases with a new eight-speed automatic.
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata is a viable option for those who need efficient and affordable transportation. While some automakers slice their car lines, Hyundai is joining others in doubling down on sedan production. Recent data shows younger consumers still want sedans, while additional insight from Edmunds reveals how automakers who no longer offer cars are losing ground to their competitors.
That said, the new Hyundai Sonata is in a excellent position.
“With the 2020 Sonata, our focus was a no-compromise innovation approach allowing Sonata owners to have great style, comfort, technology, and safety,” explained Mike O’Brien, Vice President, Product, Corporate and Digital Planning, Hyundai Motor America. “At Hyundai, we’re big fans of sweating all the details, and we have done that with the 2020 Sonata.”
How Much Is The 2020 Hyundai Sonata?
The SE starts at $23,400 while the SEL and SEL Plus begin at $25,500 and $27,450 respectively. The top-of-the-line Limited is available for $33,300. Tack on another $930 for destination. There are five different packages for the 2020 Hyundai Sonata: Convenience, Premium, Sunroof, Drive Guidance, and Tech.
Related: The 2020 Hyundai Sonata is right on the money.
What Engine Does The 2020 Sonata Have?
The SE and SEL receive Hyundai’s new Smartstream 2.5-liter engine with 185 horsepower. Opting for the SEL puts extra ponies under the hood (SEL models have 191 horsepower). An eight-speed automatic with a Shift-By-Wire selector replaces the 2019 Sonata SE’s six-speed. As a result, combined fuel economy increases to 32 MPG, an improvement of three MPG versus a 2019 model.
The SEL Plus and Limited use a Smartstream 1.6-liter with a turbo bolted on for good measure. The engine, complete with gasoline direct injection, puts out 195 lb-ft. of torque between 1,500 and 4,500 rpm.

Hyundai Sonata SE & SEL
The entry-level SE comes with an eight-inch LCD monitor, replacing last year’s seven-inch screen. New safety features include Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist; Lane Keeping Assist; Lane Follow Assist; Driver Attention Warning; and Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go among others. The aforementioned features are part of Hyundai’s SmartSense package.  
The SEL takes a more athletic approach with sportier front and rear fascias; heated side mirrors with turn signal indicators; and 17-inch alloy wheels. On the inside, the SEL includes a push-button start; 4.2-inch color LCD instrument cluster; automatic climate control; power driver’s seat; heated seats; and something Hyundai calls “Liquid Chrome” interior accents. Sounds cool!

2019/11/13,2020 VW Passat: Quick & Complete Look At The Pricing & Trim Levels,"The VW Passat receives a host of new updates for 2020.
We go through the pricing and individual trim levels below.
Car lines may be disappearing, yet some sedans are marching on much to the delight of prospective buyers. Among them, the 2020 VW Passat, a well-equipped and affordable daily driver. There are four trim levels for the 2020 VW Passat which arrives near the end of the year. Upgraded interior technology and driver-assistance features are among the highlights for 2020.
How Much Is The 2020 VW Passat?
The 2020 VW Passat will start at 22,995 in the S configuration. The SE starts at $25,845, while the SEL comes in at $31,095. The more sporty R-Line tips the cash register at $28,645. The destination charge is $920 regardless of model.
What Engine Does The 2020 VW Passat Have?
The new Passat chugs along with a 2.0-liter TSI turbo engine with direct injection. The in-line four receives a new torque converter and corresponding software. As result, torque output jumps to 206 lb-ft., an increase of 22 lb-ft. versus the 2019 model. Horsepower stays the same at 174 but that’s still plenty for this daily driver. Power is sent to the front wheels via a Tiptronic six-speed automatic.

Interior Treatments
Drivers will notice the glass-covered infotainment touchscreen for a more contemporary feel. VW says they went for a “horizontal design” inside which they believe lends to a more premium and luxurious look. The automaker also notes that, in this horizontal design, the air vents flow across the dash. It’s an interesting way to describe everything (VW didn’t elaborate much beyond that) but suffice it to say, VW tired to make the interior as nice as possible.

Three interior décor designs are available, based on trim. Volkswagen’s V-Tex leatherette and Nappa leather seating surfaces are available in addition to the standard cloth seats, and four color options are available depending on material.

2019/11/07,2020 Mazda6: A Complete Look At The Pricing & Trim Levels,"The 2020 Mazda6 has a starting MSRP just shy of $25,000.
A turbo engine joins the lineup along with new tech features.
Here is what to expect if you are shopping for a new Mazda6.
Mazda, as ever, gives you a lot of bang for your buck. The 2020 Mazda6 is a perfect example. Refined and thoroughly gone over for the new model year, everything has been looked at, from the key fob to the taillights. The 2020 Mazda6 is the Hiroshima company’s flagship midsize sedan. Very attractive on the outside as well as the inside, it packs more than enough tech features and just enough “zoom-zoom” performance to keep a wide swath of sedan buyers interested.
How Much Is The 2020 Mazda6?
It will start at a very reasonable $24,920 after destination. Not that much for a sedan this capable. Here is a handy chart that shows the pricing by trim level.
2020 Mazda 6
Trim Level MSRP w/ Destination ($920 – Continental U.S.)
Sport $24,920
Touring $27,520
Grand Touring $30,620
Grand Touring Reserve $33,120
Signature $36,220
What Engine Does The Mazda6 Have?
Ah yes, the engine room. All 2020 Mazda6 sedans come with G-Vectoring Control Plus, mated to one of two engines. The first is a Skyactiv-G 2.5-liter with 187 horsepower and 186 lb-ft. of torque, or a turbo Skyactiv-G 2.5T cranking out a respectable 250 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. of torque. Cylinder-deactivation is standard while the transmission of choice is a Skyactiv-Drive six-speed automatic. It includes a Sport Mode that recalibrates the gear ratios for more spirited driving.
Related: Considering a pre-owned Mazda6 instead? Our full review of the 2018 model.
2020 Mazda6 Sport
In addition to that turbo engine, the Mazda6 Sport will be of the most interest to us gearheads. It comes standard with the full suite of Mazda’s i-Activsense safety features. The package includes Radar Cruise Control with stop and go function; Advanced Smart City Brake Support with Pedestrian Detection; Smart Brake Support with Collision Warning; Lane Departure Warning with Lane-Keep Assist; and Blind Spot Monitoring with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert.
On the inside, you’ll get an eight-inch display, six-speaker audio system, Bluetooth connectivity, and two USB ports to charge your stuff. Dual-zone climate control (nice!), push-button start, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and an electronic parking brake (boo!) are also included.
The Sport simply has more premium features despite being the entry-level trim. Automatic on/off headlights; High Beam Control; rain-sensing windshield wipers; rearview camera (nice!); seat belt reminder indicator for all passengers; LED headlights with auto-leveling; LED taillights; and some rather nice 17-inch alloy wheels and dual exhaust outlets.

Touring & Grand Touring
The Mazda6 Touring does just what its name implies: loads up on goodies that make longer jaunts less arduous. The Touring has all the stuff in the Sport but upgrades you with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; leatherette-trimmed seats; heated front seats (yay!); and a power moonroof with interior sunshade. 19-inch alloy wheels and another two USB charging ports for the rear seats are also part of the deal.
Next is the Mazda6 Grand Touring. This version comes with larger front ventilated brake discs (always a good idea) and adds a Bose 11-speaker premium stereo with SiriusXM. Toss in the heated mirrors and steering wheel paddle shifters and you’re good to go.
Related: How does the Mazda3 drive? Here is our full review.
Grand Turing Reserve
There’s an even better Touring version, the Mazda6 Grand Touring Reserve. This highway cruiser adds a windshield-projected, head-ups color display; Mazda’s Adaptive Front-lighting system; black or Parchment leather-trimmed seats (classy); ventilated front seats; heated rear seats; and a heated steering wheel.
Beyond that, the Grand Touring Reserve tacks on power folding side mirrors; windshield wiper de-icer; and an eight-way power driver’s seat with memory. Styling gets a bump with bright silver 19-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, and a rear lip spoiler.
Mazda6 Signature
At the top of the heap, you’ll find the Mazda6 Signature. Mazda calls this “an aspirational trim level” which made me laugh. Trim levels are now aspiriational? Please no. That said, the Signature really unloads the goodies: gunmetal front grille, new badging, and either Parchment or Deep Chestnut Nappa leather with Japanese Sen wood and UltraSuede accents for the interior.
A 360-degree View Monitor with front and rear parking sensors and a seven-inch TFT reconfigurable display grace the dash along with a navigation system. Said system includes Traffic Sign Recognition and SiriusXM Traffic and Travel Link subscriptions. The headliner is black, the rearview mirror is frameless, and there are LED ambient lights to compliment the accent stitching on the leather-wrapped steering wheel.
Conclusion On The Mazda6?
Like I said at the beginning, there’s a lot of good stuff in this sedan, especially with a starting price just shy of $25,000.

2019/11/06,Mini Cooper SE: Electric Hardtop Is Ready For Driving!,"The 2020 Mini Cooper SE is a new electrified two-door hardtop.
DC charging provides 80 percent battery life in about 35 minutes.
At just over 180 horsepower, this little Mini should be fun to drive.
Mini will finally be bringing the electrified version of their beloved little hatchback to America. Although not a direct competitor for the more upscale Tesla and Porsche offerings, it should compete rather nicely with cars like the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt, and Fiat 500e. The first thing you’ll notice about the 2020 Mini Cooper SE is, well, that it looks just like a Mini. There’s no space-age styling or anything along those lines. Just that classic two box, hatchback style that sort of looks like a toaster on wheels.
What Is the Mini Cooper SE?
The Mini Cooper SE is based on the Mini Hardtop 2 Door from 2014. In terms of dimensions, it has only gotten a bump in height by a scant 18 millimeters (.7 inch, ha!). This is to make room for the floor-mounted battery packs and the new HVAC pump. The heat pump is there to maximize range during colder weather, which everyone in the Midwest will be thankful for.
Related: Mini enthusiasts will appreciate this insightful book.
Despite all of the green stuff and batteries, Mini says unequivocally the Cooper SE is still very much a Mini. Thanks to the low center of gravity and the torquey electric drivetrain, the SE retains the brand’s fun-to-drive personality. Case in point: that electric motor driving the front wheels provides 181 horsepower and 199 lb-ft. of torque. 60 mph comes up in 6.9 seconds and top speed is an adequate 93 mph. A nifty two-mode regenerative braking system helps maximize battery life.

How Long Does It Take To Charge?
Yes, yes, you might say, but what about charging? What about all that EV stuff that makes a lot of people nervous? For starters, the Mini Cooper SE comes standard with AC Charging at up to 7.4 kW. That means you can get a 100 percent charge at home in about four hours. If you opt for DC Charging, that’ll flow in at 50 kW and can get you an 80 percent charge in as little as 35 minutes, utilizing the standard SAE Combo fast charging.
You will notice the new “Filler Flap” with LED status indicator for when your Mini Cooper SE is in charge mode. There is also a programmable locking feature as part of the charging scheme that prevents the cord from being unplugged. And get this: when your Mini is all full, it can automatically unlock to allow others needing access to the charger when using public stalls.

What Features Does The Mini Cooper SE Have?
The Mini Cooper SE comes standard with a base trim level that is anything but standard or base. There is an array of premium equipment, but also two additional trim levels if you want extra items and features. Inside, you’ll see the Dynamic Digital Instrument Cluster which features a digital speedometer and indicators for charge and power levels. Drivers can scroll through data like remaining range and charging/charge levels.
The standard equipment package already includes a 6.5-inch navigation display; Apple CarPlay and Bluetooth connectivity; heated front seats, washer jets, and mirrors; keyless entry; automatic climate control; LED headlights and fog lights; and a cool Storage Package. Safety features include Forward Collision Warning, Acoustic Pedestrian Warning, and a Rear View Camera.

What Does The Mini Cooper SE Cost?
The new Mini Cooper SE will go on sale early March 2020 at dealers across the U.S. for $30,750 (with destination). Federal tax credits and similar state incentives will likely drop that figure significantly. Mini says qualified consumers can get a Cooper SE for as low as $17,900, along with additional incentives such as HOV lane access in some states.

2019/11/05,Mustang Lithium Has a Beast Mode & Tons of Power!,"MUSTANG LITHIUM
DEVELOPERS
Ford / Webasto
POWERTRAIN
Webasto EVDrive
TRANSMISSION
Getrag MT82 six-speed manual
COOL FACTOR
Really High
The Mustang Lithium is pretty darn powerful. That’s the easiest way to put it. The high-performance pony car prototype is the brainchild of Ford and Webasto, who are using it as a canvas for future battery and thermal management technologies. When it comes to electric vehicles, Ford is pushing on the gas (no pun intended). By 2022, the automaker will invest more than $11.5 billion in EV development. A Mustang-inspired electric SUV is expected to hit the market next year, followed by an all-electric F-150 in a few years.
“Ford has made no secret that we are electrifying our most popular nameplates,” explained Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s Chief Product Development and Purchasing Officer. “This one-off Mustang prototype is a great opportunity for us, together with Webasto, to showcase to our customers what new electrified powertrains can do for performance in a car they already know and love.”
How Much Power Does The Mustang Lithium Have?
Mustang Lithium cranks out over 900 horsepower and 1,000 lb-ft. of torque, both of which are available instantaneously. The battery electric pony car features a unique set of drive modes with a specific amount of torque for different driving scenarios. Each mode is controlled via the 10.4-inch touchscreen display inside. The drive modes range from tame and mild to “holy smokes I bet that’s unreal!” Said drive modes are: Valet, Sport, Track, and Beast.
Yes, we too are wondering what all is involved in Beast Mode.
Mustang Lithium features a carbon fiber body, a lower stance (one inch), and 20-inch (staggered) Forgeline wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Photo: Ford Motor Company.
How The Mustang Lithium Works
Under the hood is a Phi-Power, dual-core electric motor and dual power inverters. Everything is fed by an 800-volt Webasto battery system with EVDrive Technology that can discharge a mega-watt of energy. Ford and Webasto say the system generates less heat but more electric force than most EVs today. As a point of comparison, 800 volts is twice the voltage of most EVs on the road currently. 
“Very similar to Ford’s push for vehicle electrification, this is an innovative way to further the technologies we’re developing to enable vehicle electrification while creating a vision of how cool the future of electric performance will be,” said Mark Denny, North America President and CEO, Webasto Customized Solutions.

The Mustang Lithium Uses a Manual Rower
A drag-strip-spec, Calimer-version of the Getrag MT82 six-speed manual transmission with billet internals handles all that power. The Mustang Lithium also employs Ford Performance half shafts and Super 8.8 Torsen differentials.

Additional features include Ford’s Track Handling Pack and strut tower brace; Brembo six-piston front brakes (from the Shelby GT350R); side splitters and a rear diffuser by Sankuer Composite Technologies; Webasto hood with see-through polycarbonate windows; TurboDX charging solution; and a TurboCord portable charger. In other words, a lot of really cool stuff!

Will The Mustang Lithium Be Available?
Given the specs, the Challenger SRT Demon and any number of exotic and/or hyper cars should be getting nervous, right? Well, maybe not yet. Ford and Webasto say the Mustang Lithium is only a prototype for which to gauge interest in the next generation of EV powertains and performance cars. Consider us interested.
Currently, the 2020 Explorer and Escape hybrid feature Ford’s fourth-generation lithium-ion battery technology. The setup is similar to the Mustang Lithium’s energy storage system. So maybe we will see something similar to this EV pony car in the coming years? We certainly hope so.

2019/11/05,2020 Honda CR-V: What’s New & What’s Changed,"All-wheel drive is available on every model.
LX trim adds 1.5L turbo engine and Honda Sensing.
Electrified CR-V Hybrid to join the lineup early next year.
The 2020 Honda CR-V cruises into dealerships with a host of updates for the new model year. Among them, a refreshed exterior, upgraded safety tech, and a new turbo engine for the LX trim. The CR-V is a winner for Honda, with cumulative U.S. sales now topping five million units over the last 22 years. Here is a look at what to expect when shopping for a 2020 Honda CR-V.

2019/10/31,Ford To Add Over-The-Air Updates In 2020: How Will They Work?,"Next year, Ford expects to introduce over-the-air updates for new cars.
Software updates are designed to run “in the background” and be seamless.
Ford says OTA technology will be more convenient in the long run for owners.
Starting next year, Ford will equip most of their newly-redesigned vehicles in the United States to receive, handle, and install over-the-air updates. Sometimes called OTA technology, Ford says it will make it easier for customers to receive necessary quality and capability updates to improve vehicle performance, as well as reduce dealership visits.
“Nobody wants to feel like they’re missing out on great features right after spending their hard-earned money on a new vehicle – that’s where our over-the-air updates can help,” explained Don Butler, Executive Director, Connected Vehicle and Services, Ford Motor Company. “We can now help improve your vehicle’s capability, quality, and overall driving experience while you’re sleeping.”
When Will Ford’s Over-The-Air Updates Arrive?
Ford expects to deliver its first updates about six months after launching the first vehicles with the capability in 2020. The updates may even go unnoticed by some, as the platform allows them to be installed in the background. Said platform keeps current programs running until the new version is ready for activation. Ford says they want the updates to be as seamless as possible.
“Computer updates that require reboots seem to come at the most inconvenient times, which is why we wanted to make our updates as invisible to customers as possible,” Butler said.
According to a recent Forbes report, special precautions were taken to ensure Ford’s OTA technology is safe and secure. “We have protection and encryption for the delivery pipe itself,” Butler told the publication.
Starting next year, Ford will equip most of their newly-redesigned vehicles in the United States to receive, handle, and install over-the-air updates.
How Do Ford’s Over-The-Air Updates Work?
Owners select a time they are not driving the vehicle, like in the middle of the night for example. When owners come out in the morning, the updates have already been performed and the vehicle is ready to be driven. While Ford says some updates do require the vehicle to be parked and shut off, others can be activated in under two minutes.
Owners receive notifications when updates are available, and can have them applied automatically over Wi-Fi or cellular connections. In-vehicle alerts tell what updates were installed the next time they jump in the vehicle.
Many updates will be virtually invisible to customers via the cloud-connected and vehicle software platform. Ford plans to introduce its OTA technology in 2020. Photo: Ford Motor Company.
What Over-The-Air Updates Are Not
Over-the-air updates are not a substitute for routine maintenance. Basic maintenance, like changing the oil and fluids, and rotating the tires is still the best way to get the most life out of any car. While convenient, OTA technology will not help if a vehicle needs things like new brakes and suspension components. Always have any vehicle, regardless of how new it is, inspected by a trusted mechanic each time you take it in for an oil change.

Under the hood, horsepower and torque both increase.
Tech features include Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.
The 2020 Mazda CX-9 is here and the three-row crossover receives a number of updates. Nearly everything gets a touch up, from the engine and all-wheel drive system, to the availability of captain’s chairs and a power liftgate. Even the entry-level Sport comes with heated cloth seats; Bluetooth connectivity; 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels; rain-sensing windshield wipers; heated outside mirrors; and automatic on/off headlights and High Beam Control.
Mazda says they are going for a sense of sophistication and refinement with the new CX-9. Did they get the job done? Let’s take a look and see.
How Much Is The 2020 Mazda CX-9?
 Trim Level Front-Wheel Drive i-Activ All-Wheel Drive
CX-9 Sport $33,790 $35,690
CX-9 Touring $35,610 $37,510

2020 Mazda CX-9: Power & Performance
Under the hood, the Mazda CX-9 receives a nice power upgrade. The crossover’s Skyactiv-G 2.5T engine now delivers 320 lb-ft. of torque on 93 octane (310 lb-ft. on 87 octane), an increase of 10 lb-ft. versus the 2019 model.

Does The 2020 Mazda CX-9 Have All-Wheel Drive?
Yes it does! Mazda’s i-Activ all-wheel drive is standard for the CX-9 Signature and available on all other trim levels. The big highlight here is the new off-road traction assist feature, which replaces the normal traction control button. Mazda says the system was designed to help drivers navigate uneven terrain. The feature cuts power and increases braking to wheels that suddenly loose traction to help a driver regain control.
Not surprisingly, Mazda’s G-Vectoring Control Plus is also standard for the 2020 CX-9.
This video explains how Mazda’s G-Vectoring Control Works.

The Grand Touring’s windshield wiper de-icer, heated second-row captain’s chairs, and front and rear parking sensors are all useful features.
Recently, we took the 2019 Mazda CX-9 Grand Touring for a test drive and really enjoyed it. We have every reason to believe the 2020 variant will provide the same driving dynamics (if not improved).
We recently reviewed the 2019 Mazda CX-9 and enjoyed our drive.
2020 CX-9 Signature
At the top of the range, passengers settle in with heated second-row captain’s chairs. Up front, drivers have two USB charging ports in the center console. Deep Chestnut or Parchment Nappa leather seating surfaces are on offer to match the Santos Rosewood interior trim and hand-stitched steering wheel. The Signature has trim-specific silver wheels and a Soul Red Crystal paint.
Special Maintenance Plan
The 2020 Mazda CX-9 includes complimentary maintenance for two years or 30,000 miles. Mazda says they are offering this to enhance the premium ownership experience.

2019/10/29,2020 Land Rover Defender: Returning to Reclaim Lost Glory,"The Defender is coming back to the United States for the first time in 20 years.
Off-road tools include a Twin-Speed Transfer Box and Locking Center Differential.
The forthcoming Defender 90 and 110 are underpinned by a new D7x architecture.
The 2020 Land Rover Defender is back with a vengeance! The last Defender sold on American shores was way back in 1997. After that, Land Rover sent the Defender on a long hiatus and insisted on giving us some buttoned-down crossovers like the Evoque, Velar, and new Discovery Sport.
Now the Defender is back to reclaim its former glory, but let’s be honest here: modern Land Rovers are known for many things – like off-road prowess and refined luxury – but these vehicles are not exactly class-leaders in terms of reliability and durability. However, Land Rover wants to change all that with the 2020 Defender.
In order to ensure the new Defender is tough like its forebearers, Land Rover drove the Defender through 1.2 million miles of real-world testing. This meant exposing the vehicle to the most inhabitable places on Earth, including scorching heat, sub-artic temperatures, and high-altitude environments.
When Is The New Land Rover Defender Coming Out?
The 2020 Land Rover Defender is available in two body styles: the long-wheelbase Defender 110 with five, six, or seven seats; and the shorter-wheelbase Defender 90 with two doors. The former will enter the U.S. market by the spring of 2020 while the latter follows soon after.
The new Land Rover Defender 110 will be available with four distinct Accessory Packs (Explorer, Adventure, Country, and Urban), as well as 170 individual accessories. Photo: Jaguar Land Rover.
How Much Horsepower Does The 2020 Land Rover Defender Have?
Since the Defender 110 arrives first, let’s focus on this one for now. There are two trim models to choose from: P300 and P400. The Defender 110 P300 has a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder mill producing 296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque. It’s not a drag racer, but the motor is torquey enough to propel the Defender from zero to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds.
Meanwhile, the Defender P400 has a larger 3.0-liter inline-six with both turbocharging and electric supercharging. If that’s not enough, it also has a mild-hybrid assist system. All in, this motor is good for 395 horsepower and 406 lb-ft. of torque. The mild-hybrid system harvests braking energy and stores electricity in a small lithium-ion battery pack. It’s also responsible for powering the electric supercharger, which is enough for a 60 mph run in 5.8 seconds.
Both the P300 and P400 have an eight-speed ZF automatic and permanent all-wheel drive with a Terrain Response system.

What’s The Towing & Carrying Capacity of The 2020 Defender?
With the application of modern engineering techniques, the new Land Rover Defender has a maximum towing capacity of 8,201 lbs. The vehicle also comes with Advanced Tow Assist. This feature enables the driver to perform tricky reverse maneuvers by steering the trailer via a rotary controller on the center console.

Making a visit to the hardware store? How about camping gear? No sweat. The new Defender’s roof is rated for a maximum load of 370 lbs. (168 kg). Land Rover is also offering four distinct accessory packs with roof racks, a portable rinse system, an integrated air compressor, and scuff plates all around.

Old Dogs & New Tricks
You see, there’s a reason why old Defenders are considered top dog, and it all boils down to simplicity. It had a rectangular profile and boxy shape, solid front and rear axles, and no complicated computers to mess things up. It’s the old-school way of doing cars, and those old Defenders still have a huge following. In this day and age of social media, privacy issues, and smartphones, the old ways still work.
It’s safe to say the 2020 Defender is the antithesis of previous models. For starters, the body-on-frame chassis is gone to make way for an all-aluminum D7x unibody platform, which is essentially the same underpinnings of a car-based crossover. From this alone, I can imagine purists storming Land Rover’s gates with pitchforks and torches in hand, but you need to look at it from a different perspective.

2020 Land Rover Defender: Essential Foundations
Sure, a ladder chassis with a body-on-frame construction is more robust, but it’s not an ideal ingredient if you’re looking for a refined ride. Land Rover understands most SUV buyers do most of their driving over paved roads and decided the best way was to use a toughened and modified aluminum unibody chassis.
In fact, using a clever mix of high-strength steel and aluminum, Land Rover claims the Defender’s chassis is three times stronger than most rivals, including those from Land Rover as well. A new chassis demands new legs, and Land Rover made sure to fit an independent suspension up front and out back. The automaker says this means the 2020 Defender will provide a better ride without compromising off-road grip and traction.

Respectful of The Past
DID YOU KNOW
The first V8 in a Land Rover Defender was a 3.5-liter with a carburetor in 1979. It was used for the Series III, Stage 1 and created 90 bhp.
Style-wise, the new Defender has a distinctive silhouette, but the boxy cues are now more rounded than ever. It still looks tough and capable, like a muscular bouncer wearing an expensive tuxedo. “The new Defender is respectful of its past but is not harnessed by it,” said Gerry McGovern, Chief Design Officer, Land Rover. “This is a new Defender for a new age. Its unique personality is accentuated by its distinctive silhouette and optimum proportions, which make it both highly desirable and seriously capable – a visually compelling 4×4 that wears its design and engineering integrity with uncompromised commitment.”

The vehicle has higher sills and shorter overhangs no matter which model you choose. This allows an approach and departure angle of 38 degrees front and 40 degrees rear. It can also climb a 45-degree slope and descend on hills with a 47-degree angle. The new Defender is also capable of wading through 35 inches of water, which comes in handy when attacking river crossings or typhoon-induced floods.
Practical & Comfortable Interior
The 2020 Defender’s interior has an exposed powder-coated magnesium crossbeam, integrated grab handles, and partially-exposed structural door casings; all paying homage to the analog vibe of previous Defender models.
On the other hand, modern touches include a 12.3-inch central touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a new electronic vehicle architecture with over-the-air updates. You also get a 3D surround-view camera, a six-speaker audio system (with optional 10 and 14 speakers), and USB ports along with 12V sockets in the front and second row.

2020 Land Rover Defender: Pricing & Availability
The new Land Rover Defender is offered in six models. The Defender P300 is available in Standard and S trim and starts at $49,900 and $53,350. The Defender P400 is available in SE ($62,250), HSE ($68,350), and X ($80,900) trim models. Meanwhile, the Defender First Edition starts at $68,650.
From the looks of things, however, the new Defender won’t come cheap when it’s all said and done. Load it up with options and accessory packs and you can easily breach the $100,000 barrier.
Body color options include three new metallic shades: Tasman Blue, Pangea Green, and Gondwana Stone. Other colors include Fuji White, Eiger Grey, Santorini Black, and Indus Silver.

2019/10/25,Nissan Leaf Prototype: This Mule Packs a Punch!,"WHEELBASE & LENGTH
106.2 / 176.4 (inches)
WIDTH & HEIGHT
72 / 60.6 (inches)
DRIVELINE
Electric AWD
As more electric vehicles find their way onto the market, Nissan is working on a special twin-motor, all-wheel-control test car. This Nissan Leaf prototype, based on the Leaf e+, is outfitted with an array of new tech currently under development for Nissan’s next line of EVs. The company says they are aiming for a more engaging experience behind the wheel.
“The new electric-drive, four-wheel-control technology now being developed integrates Nissan’s electric propulsion and 4WD control technologies with our chassis control technology to achieve a huge leap in acceleration, cornering, and braking performance, on par with the latest sports cars,” explained Takao Asami, Nissan Senior Vice President for Research and Advanced Engineering.
Lots of Torque (But Comfortable Too)
The Leaf EV tester uses separate front and rear electric motors that provide a maximum output of 304 horsepower and 501 lb-ft. of torque. To compliment the power, Nissan is engineering “ultra-high-precision” controls in the hopes their next EV will be more comfortable to drive. Nissan seems keen on building up the driving dynamics of their forthcoming EV line. Perhaps they want to overcome the notion EVs are boring, although a J.D. Power review in February gave the current Leaf high marks for driving dynamics.

How Does The Nissan Leaf Prototype Work?
The way the vehicle employs regenerative braking to prevent itself from pitching and diving is really interesting. The Nissan Leaf prototype does it simultaneously at the front and rear to reduce the feeling of being “shaken back and forth” according to the company.
Related: The electric car is dead, long live the electric car!
Similarly, on rough or bumpy roads and when accelerating, the motor controls minimize irregular and erratic movements. Further, the system applies independent braking at each of the four wheels to maximize the cornering force of each tire. This type of setup will help drivers feel more confident behind the wheel says Nissan because it can handle a variety of road conditions.

Nice Inside
Despite being a tester, it’s not exactly Spartan on the inside. The 12.3-inch display sits atop the instrument panel and provides real-time info on the vehicle’s control systems. The display helps drivers better understand what is happening as the Nissan Leaf prototype is heading down the road.
And those even look like sport cloth seats!

What Will Nissan Do With This?
That’s hard to say and Nissan didn’t give us any additional details. It’s unlikely this beastly powertrain will land in the new Leaf, but something does seem brewing in the automaker’s EV department. “Soon, Nissan will launch a next-generation EV that will be a true breakthrough,” Asami said. Fair enough. We just hope whatever it is, they offer it in a Midnight Edition.

Infiniti QX60: The Bestseller
The 2020 QX60 crossover is the brand’s top-selling model, probably because it has a versatile three-row/seven-passenger layout with a bunch of family-oriented features.
Styling-wise, the QX60 features LED daytime running lights, fog lights, and turn signals in the side mirrors, along with 18-inch and 20-inch wheels.

2019/10/23,2020 Toyota Prius: Still Efficient After All These Years,"The 2020 Prius is available now for a fairly reasonable MSRP.
All-wheel drive models feature a nickel-metal hydride battery.
Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa included on all trim levels.
In so many ways, the Toyota Prius is the hybrid. It put the hybrid concept on the market and remains a genuine hit for Toyota. For 2020, the Prius seems to have more of everything. It still gets fantastic mileage; has an all-wheel drive variant; a bunch of safety tech; a fancy touchscreen interface; and infotainment connectivity up the wazoo. What follows is an in-depth look at the 2020 Toyota Prius.
2020 Toyota Prius: Love It or Hate It?
Look, I get it. A lot of gearheads hate this car. They lump Prius drivers into one big terrible category. The styling is questionable (at best). The performance is, well, leisurely. But that also overlooks the stone cold fact the Toyota’s Prius is a technological marvel. The hybrid layout plays to the strengths of both on-board drive systems. The ICE engine handles the long-running, highway stretches where revs are constant for hours (the spot on the map where EVs are terrible). By contrast, the electric drivetrain handles the around town, constant revving up and down where it is strongest.

What Is The Mileage of The 2020 Prius?
Add all of that together, along with a co-efficient of drag that rivals most sports cars (0.24), and the 2020 Prius will get you 58/53 city/highway and a very impressive 56 combined mpg. There’s also an AWD-e model, which gives you more control when weather and road conditions are less than ideal. The AWD-e sill gets impressive fuel economy too (52/48 city/highway and 50 combined mpg).
The all-wheel drive setup is not just an ICE with an electric drive tacked on, however. It is an automatic, on-demand system that does away with a center diff. See, you don’t need one of those when the rears are powered by an independent electric and magnet-less motor. This works from a stop up to 6 mph or, if the situation calls for it, all the way up to 43 mph. Once you’re up and moving, the on-demand system runs in front-wheel drive as much as possible to maximize fuel economy.

Engine & Powertrain
The centerpiece of the 2020 Prius is the 1.8-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine and two motor-generators mated to an electronically-controlled, planetary-type CVT. Slowing down is handled by Toyota’s Electronically Controlled Brake System that coordinates between regenerative braking and the vehicle’s hydraulic brakes. This both brings you to a stop and juices up the batteries a little.

2020 Audi A5: This Hot Tamale Is Still Smokin'
Front-wheel drive models use a lithium-ion battery, while the AWD-e versions go with a nickel-metal hydride battery. Toyota went this way since nickel-metal hydride batteries are inherently resilient to extreme temperature change. In other words, Toyota is anticipating the all-wheel drive buyers who live in cold weather. Speaking of cold weather, the XLE (both FWD and AWD-e) is standard with heated front seats. Way to think about your customers in Minnesota!

New Architecture & Chassis
All of these drivetrain goodies are bolted onto Toyota’s New Global Architecture. The platform, with its lower center of gravity, integrates a high-strength body and multi-link rear suspension. A variety of materials are used throughout, from hot-stamped and high tensile steels to aluminum components like the hood, rear doorframes, and brake calipers. The aluminum helps keep weight low so the 2020 Toyota Prius is as efficient as possible.  
Related: On the road with the 2019 Toyota Prius.
Styling & Design
Toyota still thinks the Prius looks good, and it is hard to argue about subjective things like this; but, to my eyes, it still seems like it’s styled differently for difference’s sake. Or if nothing else, for functionality’s sake. It has a bunch of trick features like automatic grille shutters and an electric compressor for a nearly silent and uniquely-intelligent air conditioning system. The “Smart-flow mode” directs airflow only to seated occupants to conserve energy.
Bi-LED headlamps and LED rear combination lamps are now standard; and that full-width glass panel beneath the spoiler aids rearward visibility while that huge bar midway up the decklid blocks a lot of your view. But who cares about that, since a backup camera comes standard.

2020 Toyota Prius: Safety & Security
And, of course, there are safety systems aplenty in the 2020 Toyota Prius. There’s standard Toyota Safety Sense P that uses millimeter-wave radar and a camera sensor to detect pedestrians; vehicles and lane markers; and headlights in the surrounding area. Other safety gee-gaws include a Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection; Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist; Automatic High Beams; and Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.
There’s also a Vehicle Proximity Notification System to help alert pedestrians and cyclists when the 2020 Prius is running solely on battery power.
Front-wheel drive models offer up to 65.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down. AWD-e models offer 62.7 cubic feet of space, the difference due to accommodating the AWD-e system.
Pricing, Availability & Warranty
The 2020 Prius comes in L Eco, LE, XLE, and Limited grades for front-wheel drive. The AWD-e comes in LE and XLE grades. All models share interior features such as the 4.2-inch Dual Multi-Information Display with customizable screens; the Energy Monitor; and a Hybrid System Indicator. There is also a batch of economy-focused features like Eco Score and Eco Savings Record; along with Eco Wallet and Eco Diary.

2019/10/15,2020 Audi A6 allroad: A Big Win For Wagon Fans!,"The 2020 Audi A6 allroad should be a delightful treat for those who prefer wagons to SUVs.
Six different drive modes are complimented by an air suspension with controlled damping.
Audi did not reveal pricing or availability for the U.S. market. Expect this at a later date.  
The Audi A6 allroad is coming to the United States in 2020, which is welcome news for those who love wagons. The new A6 allroad is anything but ordinary in terms of styling, but with regard to technology and performance, the sleek wagon is arguably right on the money. Audi says the vehicle has a refined character, striking off-road enhancements, and distinct character. It’s kinda hard to argue with them.
Here is a look at the 2020 Audi A6 allroad.
How Is The 2020 Audi A6 allroad Equipped?
It’s not surprising how the wagon employs Audi’s evergreen quattro all-wheel drive technology. The 3.0-liter V6 TFSI engine pumps outs 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque with the help of a Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle (MHEV) system. A seven-speed, S tronic dual-clutch automatic helps relay power to the ground. The icing on the cake is the special adaptive air suspension with controlled damping and hill descent control.
A top-end performance version, the RS 6 Avant, will arrive in the U.S. next year.
They Don’t Call It An “allroad” For Nothing!
The adaptive air suspension helps the new A6 allroad switch between on and off-road driving rather easily. There are six different modes, starting with the 5.5 inches of ground clearance offered in Auto. This first mode provides the most balance for daily driving, followed by Comfort which mellows out the steering and throttle. From there, Dynamic lowers the vehicle 0.6 inches while ushering in more immediate throttle, transmission, and steering responses.
Off-Road gives an extra 1.2 inches of ground clearance up to 21.7 mph. Lift mode raises things up another 0.6 inches (under 21.7 mph) while Individual allows drivers to tweak things to their preferences. At its maximum height, the new A6 allroad sits 1.8 inches higher than the A6 sedan for a total ground clearance of 7.3 inches.
Extra Off-Road Tools
The 2020 Audi A6 allroad comes with all-wheel steering to help navigate rough terrain. When the pavement ends, drivers can view a display on the MMI monitor with the vehicle’s current tilt angle in longitudinal and transverse directions. A warning is given if a roll over appears imminent. While traversing a steep incline, the allroad’s hill descent control limits speed by braking all four wheels selectively, and individually as necessary.

The wheel arches and rocker panels come in a Scandium gray matte color that contrast the body paint, which looks pretty cool. The grille, with it’s chrome vertical slats, is specific to the 2020 Audi A6 allroad; as are the 20-inch wheels which help distinguish the wagon from it’s sedan counterpart. (Just in case the styling alone wasn’t enough!). Looking closer at the roof rails we see what Audi calls an “Alu-Optic” finish.

2019/10/11,2020 VW Atlas Cross Sport: How It’s Equipped & What To Expect,"The VW Atlas Cross Sport is a more athletic and stylish version of the current Atlas.
VW says the 2020 Atlas Cross Sport is part of a new SUV strategy for the automaker. 
Two different powertrains and new safety features are among the vehicle’s high points.
The 2020 VW Atlas Cross Sport looks modern and muscular on the outside; cool and connected on the inside. As well it should. This is an important one for VW as the Atlas Cross Sport represents their “first fruits” of a new SUV strategy. As we see today, SUVs sell like hot cakes and automakers of all walks are rushing to the party; higher nameplates like Bentley, Lamborghini, and Ferrari being no exception. They are in the SUV game too.
Setting The Stage
For VW, it’s about spotting new opportunities in a segment already swelling with offerings. According to a Bank of America study, as reported on by the Wall Street Journal, there are 96 different SUVs and crossovers on the market now, up from 70 in 2014. That same study finds we can expect nearly 150 models by 2023. Yet VW believes there is still room.
“Building off the success of the Atlas seven-seater midsize SUV, we see an opportunity for a five-seater model that offers even more style and almost as much interior space,” said Scott Keogh, CEO, Volkswagen Group of America. “We look forward to entering this growing segment with the Atlas Cross Sport, which offers outstanding Volkswagen technology, driver-assist features, style, and value.”
What Is The VW Atlas Cross Sport?
The new Atlas Cross Sport is a midsize SUV that offers two different engines and seats five. Inspired by the current VW Atlas, the Cross Sport looks more coupe-like and athletic. Overall length is a bit shorter, although the second row folds down to accommodate additional cargo. Connectivity and safety features include in-vehicle 4G LTE WiFi, Volkswagen’s Car-Net suite, and Forward Collision Warning with Autonomous Braking.
There are eight trim levels: S, SE, SE w/Tech, SE w/Tech R-Line, SEL, SEL R-Line, SEL Premium, and SEL Premium R-Line. VW says a few trim levels will have late availability: SE with Tech R-Line, SEL R-Line, and the SEL Premium R-Line.
Exterior Styling & Interior Design
The Cross Sport is more energetic looking than the traditional Atlas on which it’s based. From the front, we see a three-bar chrome grille complete with a new light signature that extends the width of the middle bar. Moving around the vehicle we catch the raked rear pillar and rear hatch. Here we see a new design for the rear lights, chrome accents, and window. R-Line trims will add more heavily sculpted bumpers with chrome and piano black treatments around the lower front air scoops. 21-inch aluminum-alloy wheels are also available for R-Line editions.

On the inside, a new steering wheel (optionally heated) compliments the available accent stitching for the door inserts and seats. The list of available features is nearly endless, from wireless phone charging to heated rear seats; ventilated front seats; rear sunshades; and a Fender Premium stereo. The latter is a must-have for us, especially since we are on a Metallica kick lately (Black Album, S&M, Load – you name it).
The Cross Sport is 2.8 inches shorter and 2.3 inches lower than the current Atlas, despite having the same 117.3-inch wheelbase. However, VW says the wheelbase helps with interior space. Measurements come in at 111.8 cubic feet of passenger space; 40.4 inches of rear-seat legroom; 40.3 cubic feet of luggage space behind the second-row seats; and 77.8 cubic feet with the second row folded.
VW Atlas Cross Sport: Under The Hood
The VW Atlas Cross Sport will haul the mail with one of two powertrains, both available with all-wheel drive. The first is a four-cylinder turbo with 235 horsepower, followed by a 276-horsepower V6. An eight-speed automatic handles the shifting for both engines. Weekend warriors and outdoor enthusiasts may want to opt for the V6 Towing Package. It gives the Atlas Cross Sport a 5,000 lbs. towing capacity.

Connectivity & Safety Tech
The Volkswagen Car-Net suite gets an overhaul for 2020 with more no-charge services for five years, plus new subscription options. One feature, Car-Net Remote Access, comes at no extra charge for five years. It allows owners to, via a mobile app, start the vehicle, lock and unlock the doors, and receive info on the fuel level, mileage, and door and window status. Later this year, owners can connect their VW Car-Net account to compatible smart home devices.
And to think, at one time fuel injection was the latest technology. My how times change.
Safety features include Forward Collision Warning with Autonomous Braking (Front Assist); Blind Spot Monitoring; and Rear Traffic Alert. Adaptive Cruise Control with a Stop and Go feature and Park Distance Control become standard on higher trim levels. New safety features for the Atlas Cross Sport include Traffic Jam Assist and Dynamic Road Sign Display.
What Is Traffic Jam Assist?
This system uses the front camera and radar sensor to maintain distance from the car in front, while also centering the Atlas Cross Sport in its lane. Operating up to 37 mph, Traffic Jam Assist can bring the vehicle to a full stop if conditions demand. When traffic starts moving again (within three seconds), the Atlas Cross Sport will resume with the normal flow.

All Atlas Cross Sport models with navigation will display things like speed limits, no-passing zones, and school and work zones on the navigation screen. Multiple signs can show simultaneously when necessary.

VW Atlas Cross Sport: Manufacturing & Availability
The Atlas Cross Sport is available now. Starting MSRP for the entry-level S begins at $30,545, going as high as $49,795 for the SEL Premium R-Line. Tack on another $1,020 for destination.
The vehicle is built alongside the Atlas and Passat at the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant. In order to prepare for Atlas Cross Sport production, VW invested $340 million into the facility which employs around 3,800 people.

2019/10/09,Porsche Panamera 10 Year Edition Celebrates A Decade,"The 2020 Porsche Panamera 10 Year Edition celebrates a decade of the nameplate.
New standard features and “exclusive aesthetics” are in store for the special editions. 
The Porsche Panamera, the company’s “practical” four-door, has been around for ten years now. That seems astonishing. To me, this thing still seems new, if not exactly fresh. Maybe that’s because I’m still getting used it. Yes, I know, it’s a Porsche. Yes, I know, it’s fast and yes, it is very capable; but man, ten years in and it still hasn’t grown on me. Porsche says the Panamera 10 Year Edition celebrates their first and only four-door’s anniversary with exclusive aesthetics and new standard equipment. We’ll let that bit about aesthetics slide, because, whoo-boy.
But what else do we get, ten years on?
How Is The Porsche Panamera 10 Year Edition Equipped?
For a start, the Panamera 10 Year Edition comes standard with a batch of additional comfort and safety features. ParkAssist including Surround View; LED matrix-design headlights including PDLS Plus; Lane Change Assist and Lane Keep Assist are now standard equipment. Also standard are comfy, heated 14-way seats with a flashy Porsche crest on the headrests. Soft-close doors and a Bose Surround Sound system are also standard.
On the performance front, the adaptive three-chamber air suspension includes Porsche’s Active Suspension Management and Power Steering Plus. The hybrid versions come standard with the otherwise optional 7.2 kW on-board charger.
2020 Porsche Panamera 10 Year Edition: Power & Performance
The internal combustion engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 putting out 330 horsepower. Porsche refers to its prime motivational source as a “mono-turbo” setup. No, I am not kidding, and no, I am not going to call it that! Generally speaking, Panameras have ICE engines that range anywhere from 330 up to 550 horsepower, but the anniversary model makes do with just 330 ponies, sadly.
Just as sad is how the 10 Year Edition doesn’t get the top-of-the-line Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid drivetrain. That would have been much more fun with its combined output of 680 horsepower. The Panamera 4 E-Hybrid 10 Year Edition uses a 2.9-liter, twin-turbo V6 hooked up to an electric motor to generate a combined output of 457 horsepower.
Styling & Design
To set the anniversary models apart from the crowd, there are 21-inch, Panamera Sport Design wheels in satin-gloss White Gold Metallic; and “Panamera 10” logos on the front doors, also in White Gold Metallic. An anniversary logo is found inside on the front passenger trim panel and on the door entry guards. The interior is black with contrast White Gold stitching. Porsche calls that “deviated stitching” but I think they’re just being contrarian at this point.

Pricing & Availability
The new anniversary editions are available for the Panamera, Panamera 4, and Panamera 4 E-Hybrid. The Panamera 10 Year Edition and Panamera 4 10 Year Edition start at $103,300 and $107,500 respectively. The Panamera 4 E-Hybrid 10 Year Edition goes for $116,900. Each will arrive in U.S. dealerships during the first quarter of 2020.
There’s no word from Porsche whether there will be a 10 Year version of the Sport Turismo Panamera, which is unfortunate. Somehow, making this thing into a near-wagon, which is what the Sport Turismo is, substantially improves the overall looks. Who knows, maybe Porsche has one waiting in the wings they’re just not telling us about?

2019/10/09,2020 Honda Accord Hybrid: A Brief But Detailed Walk Around,"The 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid arrives with plenty of new technology. 
Honda Sensing is standard on all trims and includes Traffic Sign Recognition. 
The latest Honda Accord Hybrid is here, literally in dealer showrooms as you read this. It’s worth noting this little gem gets nearly 50 miles per gallon, and can boast best-in-class horsepower. The 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid has an EPA city and combined fuel economy rating of 48 mpg, and a highway rating of 47. That, in my book, counts as impressive. Especially considering this thing isn’t a 1979 VW Rabbit diesel that weighs 1,900 lbs.
Since this Honda Hybrid from 2020, you know it’s packing some serious tech, safety, and EV system weight. The curb weight of 3,315 lbs. to 3,386 lbs. (depending on trim) makes the fuel economy rating all that much more impressive.
How Much Does The 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid Cost?
Equally impressive is the starting price of $26,400. Honda says it’s the most affordable midsize hybrid sedan in America; not “least expensive,” but hey, why argue at this point. The 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid will run you between $26,400, up to about $36,000. No matter the trim level, you’ll still be getting around 50 miles to the gallon.
2020 Honda Accord Hybrid MSRP With Destination Charge ($930)
Hybrid $26,400
Hybrid EX $30,300
Hybrid EX-L $32,800
Hybrid Touring $36,070
Impressive Numbers
Honda is quick to point out how the 2020 Accord Hybrid is, apart from that high-tech drivetrain, just like a regular Accord. The 10th-gen Accord was called “America’s Best Sedan” by Car and Driver. Accord is the all-time leader in the magazine’s “10 Best” awards with 33 appearances on the list. That will almost guarantee another sales bump for Honda. In fact, sales of the Honda Insight and Accord Hybrid are up a combined 139 percent for the first eight months of the year.
Related: The Honda CR-V is now available as a hybrid for the first time.
How Much Power Does The 2020 Honda Accord Hybrid Have?
The hybrid drivetrain is the third generation of Honda’s two-motor hybrid-electric powertrain. The two-motor hybrid-electric powertrain joins a 2.0-liter DOHC i-VTEC Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder that whips out 232 lb-ft. of torque. Total system horsepower is 212 which Honda says is class-leading. A neat side benefit of Honda’s two-motor system is how it operates without the need for a conventional automatic transmission, which is pretty trick.
Safety & Security
This hybrid has a fantastic level of safety and driver assistance technology on-board. All 2020 Accord Hybrids will cruise around with the Honda Sensing suite of safety gear. This includes safety doodads like a Collision Mitigation Braking System with pedestrian detection; Lane Keeping Assist; Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow; and Traffic Sign Recognition. Other standard, semi-safety stuff includes automatic high-beam headlights; a Multi-Angle Rearview Camera; and a driver attention monitor.

If that’s not enough, there are optional features like blind spot information and rain-sensing wipers.
Infotainment & Connectivity
Another thing on a buyer’s mind these days is connectivity and all that infotainment jazz. Honda says the 2020 Accord Hybrid is cutting-edge, and that’s not far from the truth. All Accord Hybrids come standard with Bluetooth and Pandora compatibility for a start. The Accord Hybrid EX and above trims add an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The host of connectivity features continues with things like HD and SiriusXM satellite radio.
At the top of the range is the Hybrid Touring. That will give you a HondaLink subscription for a wide range of remote services. You can do stuff like lock and unlock the doors from virtually anywhere via your smartphone. You also have automatic emergency calling, stolen-vehicle tracking, automatic collision notification, and roadside assistance.
The Accord Touring also comes with built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi and accepts in-vehicle deliveries via Amazon Key. Which is . . . wait, how does that even work? Does Amazon Key, like, track you down in the middle of a traffic jam to hand over those tube socks you ordered off Amazon Prime? This is puzzling. I guess it counts as progress, but I’m still trying to figure out how, exactly.
2020 Honda Accord Hybrid: Manufacturing
Like all U.S. market Honda Accords, the 2020 Hybrid is manufactured exclusively at Honda’s Marysville, Ohio, plant. The Hybrid’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder is manufactured at the Anna, Ohio engine plant. The two-motor hybrid system is assembled at the company’s Raymond, Ohio transmission plant.

2019/10/05,2021 Mercedes-AMG GLB 35: Small SUV Wears Affalterbach’s Wardrobe,"The Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 is the latest compact crossover from the automaker.
Despite its size, Mercedes-AMG says it can seat seven in certain configurations. 
An AMG-tuned engine and drive modes are among the performance features.  
Hey, the new Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 is here! Wait a sec, what’s a Mercedes-AMG GLB 35? That answer is simple: it’s a great way for Mercedes-Benz to make even more money. The Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 is a muscular version of the normal GLB, a small-ish, cutesy crossover sort of thing. The Baja 1000 it (probably) won’t do, but running down to the office, nail salon, real estate showing, shopping mall, dog park, yoga studio or country club 1,000 times a week?
Easy peasy!
“With the new GLB 35 4MATIC we are extending our product portfolio by adding a highly-attractive model for an active target group that attaches special importance to versatility,” said Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. “This also includes the optional seven-seater capability of our new compact SUV, though without having to sacrifice the genes typical of an AMG.”
The 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 made its official debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show last month. Here are the details.
Power & Performance: Engine & Transmission Tech
The most interesting thing about the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 is the drivetrain. After that, it’s nothing but “luxury appointments” and the “impressive versatility” marketing-speak that is now the catchphrase cache of the three-pointed star. The drivetrain is centered around an AMG-enhanced, 2.0-liter engine breathed upon by a twin scroll turbocharger. The little four-cylinder puts out 302 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque. A die-cast aluminum crankcase helps keep weight down while the piezo injectors increase efficiency.
The engine also sports CAMTRONIC, Mercedes-AMG speak for variable valve control. The system boosts fuel economy and provides faster “warm-up” of the engine and oil. The plant is mated to an AMG eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. Mercedes says to expect quick gearshifts either up or down.
The new Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 also has this trick and standard RACE START function. It remains active as long as you keep the accelerator fully depressed. So let’s keep that accelerator fully depressed, shall we?
Does The Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 Have All-Wheel Drive?
Of course, since this is not only a modern crossover, but a Mercedes-AMG at that, it has enough computer control gizmos to make all of Neil Armstrong’s worries go away. Naturally, the Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 has all-wheel drive, controlled via a three-stage Electronic Stability Program. The system uses brake intervention to keep individual wheels from spinning when starting or accelerating. A differential locking effect shifts power to wheels that are not moving.

There are five AMG drive programs to choose from: Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual. All of these modify key performance parameters like engine, transmission, suspension, and steering response. The idea is to get you down the road, even if it’s snowy or if there’s no real road at all.
Related: An in-depth look the largest, most luxurious SUV in the Mercedes-Benz lineup.
The suspension is both sporty and comfortable, according to Mercedes-AMG. The steering knuckles, transverse control arms at the front axle, and the sub frame all get the executive treatment. Power steering is speed-sensitive with a variable ratio for better control at a variety of speeds. Stopping is handled by an AMG, high-performance braking system with flashy silver calipers with black AMG lettering. They clamp onto cast iron discs measuring 13.8 x 1.3 inches up front and 13.0 x 0.9 inches out back.
If this doesn’t stop you in time, you should have hit the pedal sooner.
Exterior Styling & Interior Design
The exterior is very stark and Teutonic and thoroughly AMG, from the radiator grille and front splitter; to the rear bumper and roof spoiler. The wheels are 19-inch, five-spoke light-alloy affairs in gray with a high-sheen finish. Optional wheels range from 19 to 21 inches and are available on request, says Mercedes-AMG. The optional AMG Night Package (snicker) features high-gloss black design elements throughout the vehicle.
The interior matches the outside and lives up to every last one of your expectations. The AMG GLB 35 has sport seats in black MB-Tex/DINAMICA microfiber with red double top-stitching. There are two optional leather packages with two-tone upholstery if that’s your thing. Even the seat belts are red.
MBUX, yes, the hilariously-named Mercedes infotainment system is front and center (literally). There are configurable displays with a central, round rev counter and bar graph-style info display. In the GLB 35, MBUX is operated via the central touchpad, the buttons on the steering wheel, and by voice or gesture control. The AI software recognizes and understands practically all commands regarding the vehicle’s major control systems, even when spoken indirectly.
Does The Mercedes-AMG GLB 35 Have A Third Row?
Even though the GLB isn’t battleship big, it does have an optional third row seat which gives you room for seven. The second row is a 40:60 split and lowers flush with the floor for additional cargo space. The third row also has two drink holders between the seats and two stowage compartments with rubber-lined inserts. Each compartment includes a USB charging socket. All of this stuff sure sounds handy.

2019/10/05,"2020 Dodge Charger Lineup: Specs, Pricing & Everything In Between","Lockup your minivans . . .
Put the hybrids in the garage . . .
The 2020 Dodge Charger is coming to town . . . 
The Dodge Charger is a car that speaks to a different part of the brain – the part where speed, noise, and style reigns supreme. I’m not sure if you’ll agree, but I always consider the Charger a niche vehicle. You can buy other cars with higher levels of refinement, luxury, and fuel efficiency, but it won’t have the cool factor of a Charger unless we’re talking about a Euro sport-luxury barge with a six-figure price tag. And there’s no other way of saying it: the Dodge Charger is a four-door muscle car, and it’s the only one in America.
Admittedly, the 2020 Dodge Charger is still riding on an aging seventh-generation platform. But if it ain’t broke, why fix it? The Auburn Hills automaker recently announced pricing for the entire 2020 Charger lineup. Let’s take a look at the delicious specs and everything in between. Note: all prices below exclude the $1,495 destination charge.
Setting The Stage
The biggest and most important changes are found in higher trim models, specifically the pulse-pounding SRT Hellcat Widebody; Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition; and Charger Scat Pack Widebody. Expect new paint colors with quirky names like Frostbite, Hellraisin, and Sinamon Stick. The Dodge Charger is available in six distinct trim levels for 2020 with standard rear-wheel drive and available all-wheel drive for some models.
Dodge Charger SXT RWD
The base Charger SXT is essentially an entry-level muscle car. It comes with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 producing 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. Power is fed to the rear wheels courtesy of a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic.
For an entry-level muscle car, the Charger SXT is well-equipped. It comes standard with a rear backup camera and rear park assist; keyless entry with remote start; and a Uconnect 4 infotainment system with a seven-inch touchscreen display. The Charger SXT also comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
The 2020 Dodge Charger SXT starts at $29,895.
Charger GT RWD
Looking for something more powerful and aggressive? The Dodge Charger GT RWD is a top pick. It has a re-tuned version of the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 motor, which now produces 300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft. of torque. The engine is connected to an eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters driving the rear wheels.
For a bit more cash, the Charger GT throws in the performance hood, fascia, and sculpted side sills. You also get a rear spoiler; performance seats and suspension; a 3.07 rear axle ratio; re-calibrated steering wheel; and a larger 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen display.
For 2020, the Charger GT receives new 20-inch by 8-inch Satin Carbon wheels. The Performance Handling Group adds a flat-bottom steering wheel in leather; 20-inch by 9-inch forged Black Noise wheels; Brembo four-piston brakes with fixed calipers; high-performance suspension; and sportier 245/45ZR20 all-season tires. Additional options for the Charger GT include the Blacktop Package with 19-inch Black Noise wheels, and a caramel Nappa leather and Alcantara interior combo.

Dodge Charger SXT AWD
Not much is new for the Charger SXT in 2020. The one change worth noting is the new 19-inch by 7.5-inch Satin Carbon wheels and optional Blacktop wheels. The Charger SXT AWD has a 300 horsepower Pentastar V6; eight-speed automatic; and an all-wheel-drive system with an active transfer case and front-axle disconnect feature to marginally improve fuel economy.
The 2020 Dodge Charger SXT AWD starts at $33,595.
Charger R/T
Stepping up to the Dodge Charger R/T gives you the iconic 5.7-liter Hemi V8. With 370 horsepower and 395 lb-ft. of torque, the Charger R/T makes all the right noises as well. The burly motor is mated to a standard TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic routing power to the rear wheels.
The R/T now comes standard with 20-inch by 8-inch Satin Carbon wheels and new fender badges with a modern Hemi script. The updated Performance Handling Group adds a leather flat-bottom steering wheel; 20-inch by 9-inch forged Black Noise wheels; black four-piston Brembo brakes with fixed calipers; performance suspension; and 245/45ZR20 all-season tires.
Meanwhile, additional options include the Blacktop Package with Black Noise wheels and a caramel interior with Nappa leather and Alcantara.
The 2020 Dodge Charger R/T starts at $36,995.
Dodge Charger Scat Pack
According to Dodge, the Charger Scat Pack offers the most muscle per dollar, and we believe it. Pound for pound, the Charger Scat Pack is the best in the lineup considering its starting MSRP and power output. The Charger Scat Pack has a specially-tuned Hemi V8 churning out 485 horsepower and 475 lb-ft. of torque. It also comes with an eight-speed automatic sending power to the rear wheels.
The 2020 Dodge Charger Scat Pack receives a revised Dynamics Package. It includes a leather flat-bottom tiller; black Brembo six-piston front brakes; and 20-inch by 9.5-inch low-gloss black wheels with 275/40ZR20 all-season tires. Also new for 2020: the caramel interior with Nappa leather and Alcantara; a carbon & suede package; new badging on the instrument panel; and extra wheel options.
The 2020 Dodge Charger Scat Pack starts at $39,995.
Related: Be on the look out when the Widebody rolls through town.
Charger Scat Pack Widebody
The Dodge Charger receives the Widebody treatment for 2020, like the Challenger did in 2017. Power comes from a 392 cubic-inch Hemi V8 with 485 horsepower and 475 lb-ft. of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels courtesy of a TorqueFlite 8HP70 eight-speed automatic.
The widebody treatment gives the Scat Pack wider fender flares for an extra 3.5 inches of body width. This extra room accommodates the larger, 20-inch by 11-inch split-five spoke wheels and high-performance Pirelli 305/35ZR20 tires. The Scat Pack Widebody also benefits from a specially-tuned suspension with Bilstein three-mode adaptive damping and selectable electric power steering.

In order to sweeten the deal, Dodge threw in additional suspension upgrades for the Charger Scat Pack Widebody. This includes stiffer front springs; modified sway bars and shock absorbers; a larger 22mm sway bar; and revised damping calibrations. The Widebody Scat Pack rushes to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds and runs the quarter-mile in 12.4 seconds at 111 mph. It pulls .98 g of lateral grip on the skidpad and comes to a stop from 60 mph in 107 feet.
This Charger is every inch a performance machine. Pricing starts at $45,995.
Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody
The 2020 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody is the fastest and most powerful mass-produced sedan in the world. With a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 producing 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft. of torque, it has the bragging rights and can prove it all day long. It launches to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, finishes the quarter-mile in 10.96 seconds, and can reach a top speed of 196 mph.
For 2020, the Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody gets the requisite fender flares; new 20-inch by 11-inch Carbon Black forged alloy wheels; and sticky Pirelli 305/35ZR20 tires. The SRT-tuned, Bilstein three-mode adaptive suspension helps deliver better grip and handling be it on the street, strip, or track.
The front fascia with an innovative “mail-slot grille” is also new for 2020. This design provides more air for the radiator to help with cooling. The Carbon & Suede Interior Package adds two other optional wheel designs as well.
Pricing starts at $69,645.
Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition
Last but definitely not least is the Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition. Longing for even more power from the Charger? The Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition is the ticket. Its 6.2-liter supercharged Hemi Hellcat V8 produces 717 horsepower and 650 lb-ft. of torque courtesy of revised power calibrations. This particular Charger pays homage to the 1969 Charger Daytona and has a limited run of 501 units – the same production number of the 1969 Charger Daytona.
Setting it apart from the rest of the family is a Daytona decklid spoiler and rear-quarter decal. It’s available in Pitch Black, White Knuckle, Triple Nickel, and B5 Blue. The latter is exclusive to this model. The 2020 Dodge Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition has a base price of $74,140.

2019/10/04,Bentley Bentayga Hybrid: When Eco Goes Posh,"This Bentley Bentayga is the automaker’s first true plug-in hybrid. 
A special “E Motor” is the heart of the new Bentayga’s powertrain.
Set to arrive in the United States during the first quarter of 2020. 
Bentley has taken its five-seater Bentayga SUV and made a hybrid version. Sure, that might seen counterproductive, given the size (enormous) and weight (also enormous), but it makes sense in a bunch of ways. I know, how could a ride like the 2020 Bentley Bentayga Hybrid make sense? Well, first off, in addition to the fact that caring about the environment just makes sense, it’s also very fashionable these days. And lets face facts: you’re not going to buy a Bentayga to haul 500 lbs. of manure down t’the farm, now are ya?
No. No you are not.
Bentley Bentayga Hybrid: Perception Is Reality
Bentley Bentaygas are all about style and comfort and the perception of capability, if not outright capability. A Bentayga is all about looking good and feeling good as you pull up to the club or your Pilates class or your stock broker’s office. And since looking good and feeling good now encompasses caring for the environment, having a Bentayga Hybrid just makes sense.
Bentley’s catchphrase for the Bentayga Hybrid is “Serenity Through Technology” and I bet Buddha, wherever he is, had to chuckle at that one. The lack of a standard Swarovski-encrusted tissue dispenser will probably damage the serenity of some customers, but probably not many. Because other than that, it lacks for precious little. Like the Continental GT, the Bentayga Hybrid is going for that ultimate grand tourer look and feel.
E Motor Design
Propulsion comes via Bentley’s new E Motor, which acts as both an electric motor and a power generator. The whole deal is hooked up to a new 3.0-liter turbo V6. The combined system creates a hefty 516 lb-ft. of torque. That electric motor is a Permanent Magnet Synchronous system putting out 94 kW of peak power, and 295 lb-ft. of torque on its own.
Bentley says everything is meant to provide instant torque and eliminate turbo lag. It’s hard to argue with them. Add it all up and you have a zero to 60 time of 5.2 seconds and a top speed of 158 mph. If you want to go faster my friend, then you will need this particular Bentley Bentayga.
Drive Modes & Total Range
The Bentayga Hybrid has three drive modes with EV Drive being a battery-only deal. In Hybrid mode, the Bentayga uses info from the nav system to optimize battery power and the engine for maximum efficiency and range. In Hold mode, engine and electric power is more balanced but in a way in which the electric range can be used later. For example, say you are driving at higher speeds on the highway then arrive back in the city where you can use battery power again. Bentley says Hold mode is meant for situations like that.

Regardless of mode, regenerative braking is always taking place.
Total driving range is 464 miles with an all-electric range of 31.7 miles. Not all that much, but you will be able to get a few errands done using just electricity. Other than that, however, it’s the same sure-footed, all-wheel drive setup you’d find in a regular Bentayga. The high-voltage battery pack recharges in 2.5 hours, which is less time than you need to play all 18 holes.
Bentley Bentayga Hybrid: Pricing & Availability
The handcrafted Bentayga Hybrid takes 130 hours to build back in Crewe, England, which lends credence to Bentley’s claim it’s the world’s most luxurious SUV. That also makes sense when you realize it will cost you $160,000 to own. If this sounds like your cup of tea, Bentley is taking orders with deliveries expected in the first quarter of 2020.

2019/10/04,2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray Convertible: Always Is. Always Was.,"We had a feeling (or a lingering hope maybe?) it was going to come eventually. And it did. The first mid-engine Chevy Corvette is finally here. With its LT2 engine, it’s the most powerful entry-level Corvette in history; and now that we can officially drop the top, it will arguably be the coolest. A convertible variant for the 2020 Stingray is welcome news for those who like the wind in their hair.
In fact, the 2020 Corvette Stingray was envisioned and engineered as a convertible from the get-go.
Corvette Stingray Convertible: Always Is. Always Was.
Larry Edsall’s book, Corvette Stingray: The Seventh Generation of America’s Sports Car, opens with the different people and events that may have propelled then GM Design Chief Harley Earl to create the now iconic Vette. A prominent theory is that Earl, in a one-off Buick LeSabre concept convertible, lead the parade prior to a race at Watkins Glen in September of 1951. Edsall later writes that racer Briggs Cunningham teased Earl, saying his Buick was fit for a parade but nothing else.
In other words, Earl’s car was all show and no go.
Today we love the Vette because it’s both show and go. It looks hot and runs like the wind. Reflecting back over the generations, we might say wind is forever woven into the Corvette’s design. When the crowds gathered around the first Corvette in January of 1953 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, they saw and admired a convertible. It makes sense that things come full circle with the 2020 Stingray. A mid-engine Vette is a milestone, even if it were a long time coming. The Corvette of 1953 was a milestone, even if it were a long time coming back then considering what European sports cars were capable of.
Regardless, the 1953 Vette gave us the wind; so too will the 2020 Stingray.
“Our goal from the beginning was to make sure customers didn’t have to sacrifice any functionality, performance or comfort when choosing the hardtop convertible,” explained Josh Holder, Corvette Program Engineering Manager. “We managed to keep the same design theme as the coupe, as well as the exceptional storage capacity and track capability.”
Fighter Jets & Warships
The 2020 Corvette Stingray takes its inspiration from fighter jets, fitting since the name Corvette derives from a ship used by the Allies during World War II. Regarding the Stingray convertible specifically, the tonneau cover has special nacelles. A nacelle is a “housing” that encloses the engine on an aircraft. In layman’s terms: that big circular thing attached to the wing. The Stingray Convertible employs these nacelles to reduce cabin wind noise. Furthermore, the Stingray’s tonneau also provides a rear, power-adjustable window and a vent for engine cooling.

Astute Corvette fans may recognize a similar nacelle design on the Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle (CERV) I and II, along with the Corvette SS and SR2 concepts.
The hardtop stows into the body without cutting into the trunk, which holds two sets of golf clubs. Convertible Stingrays retain the coupe’s front storage compartment, which fits an airline-spec carry-on and laptop bag. Chevy opted for a hardtop versus a softtop, saying it provides a quieter cabin, increased security, and a cleaner look. The two-piece top works up to 30 mph and retracts in about 16 seconds.
Related: The Corvette Stingray has the right drivetrain, right where it should be.
Power & Performance: Hitting 194!
The 2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray gets its juice from a 6.2-liter Small Block LT2 V8 engine. Complete with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic and a performance exhaust, the new Stingray generates 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft. of torque. To accommodate the power increase, the engine’s oil cooler capacity jumps by 25 percent versus the prior generation Stingray. The 6.2 has an engine-mounted dry sump oil system, plus three scavenge pumps – a first for any Corvette. The dry sump system can, according to Chevrolet, handle lateral acceleration levels exceeding 1G in all directions.
Add it all up, and the 2020 Corvette Stingray can hit 194 mph on the track.
“We’ve packed a lot of performance into the Corvette Stingray at this price when you consider an eight-speed dual clutch transmission, Small Block V8, and engine-mounted dry sump oil system are all standard,” said Tadge Juechter, Corvette Executive Chief Engineer.

2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray: Pricing & Availability
The 1LT starts at $59,995 with the 2LT following at $67,295. The top-tier 3LT starts at $71,945. “And the convertible will be priced only $7,500 more than an entry 1LT Stingray coupe,” revealed Brian Sweeney, Chevrolet U.S. Vice President. A body-color roof is standard, while Carbon Flash metallic nacelles and roof are optional. Either way, add $1,095 for destination.
The Corvette Stingray coupe will enter production at GM’s Bowling Green Assembly yet this year. Convertible production fires up in the first quarter of 2020. Right-hand drive convertibles will be available in select international markets at a later date. In the meantime, perspective buyers can build and price their own Corvette through Chevy’s website or their local dealer.

2019/09/30,2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid: Better Late Than Never,"For the first time ever, the Honda CR-V is available as a hybrid.
The hybrid has a 2.0-liter gas engine plus two electric motors.
The Honda CR-V is also available as a conventional model.
In my humble opinion, the best Honda CR-V will always be the first-gen model with the B20 engine. Five generations later, the CR-V is widely regarded as one of the world’s best-selling SUVs, and now we get a hybrid-electric version – which is the first time in the CR-V’s colorful history. Honda vehicles have a reputation of multiplying like rabbits, but I’m betting the 2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid won’t be seeing the same outcome.
After all, hybrids are niche vehicles for a niche set of buyers.
Setting The Stage: Honda Is Serious About Hybrids
The CR-V Hybrid may be late to the game, but that’s not the point. The Japanese car maker wants two-thirds of its entire global automotive sales to come from electrified vehicles by 2030. Furthermore, Honda believes its two-motor hybrid-electric technology – no matter how complicated it seems – is the most effective way of realizing long-term fuel savings and reducing CO2 emissions, all without alienating loyal Honda fans.
“The Honda CR-V is the best-selling CUV over the past two decades and the updates we’ve made to the 2020 model, including a new hybrid-electric variant, solidify its position as a leader in the compact SUV market,” said Henio Arcangeli, Jr., Senior Vice President of Automobile Sales, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. “The CR-V Hybrid also signifies our direction to bring Honda hybrid-electric technology to all core models and to invest in the production of electrified vehicles in America.”
The gasoline CR-V will remain the bestseller, but the introduction of a hybrid version is proof of Honda’s commitment. In fact, Honda sold 49,914 electrified vehicles in the U.S. in 2018, double the number sold in 2017. And in the first eight months of 2019, the company managed 42,270 combined sales of the Accord Hybrid, Insight, and Clarity. This represents year-over-year gains of 67.9 percent. 
2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid: Here’s The Lowdown
Since we’re talking about the first-ever, hybrid-electric SUV for Honda, it’s essential to talk about the juicy bits. In particular, how the two-motor hybrid powertrain does its magic underneath. Mind you, Honda didn’t just throw in a basic hybrid system for the sake of having a hybrid model, because that’s not how Honda does things. In fact, the Japanese car maker has a penchant for making the utterly complicated look very basic.

Adaptive Cruise Control: What It Is & How It Works
The 2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid comes with a 2.0-liter Atkinson cycle gasoline engine, two electric motors, and a hybrid battery pack. And there’s no conventional CVT automatic or any transmission for that matter. The vehicle achieves propulsion in three ways, depending on the behavior of your right foot. The modes are Hybrid Drive, Engine Drive, and EV Mode.
In Hybrid Drive, the gasoline engine drives a generator, which in turn powers the electric motor to move the front wheels. When traction is low, an electronic clutch activates to send power from the motor to the rear wheels. The CR-V Hybrid is the first all-wheel drive vehicle to utilize Honda’s two-motor hybrid system.
Engine Drive mode happens at higher cruising speeds. In this mode, the lock-up clutch closes to mechanically connect the gasoline engine to the drive wheels, effectively operating as a single gear. In EV mode, the engine shuts down entirely and the vehicle rolls silently using the electric motor alone. You can also engage EV mode by pressing a button.
Clever Packaging & Chassis Setup
Still with me so far? The compact Intelligent Power Unit (IPU), consisting of the hybrid battery pack and relevant control systems, is located under the cargo floor. This means the CR-V Hybrid loses its ability to have third-row seating, although cargo space is still pretty good since the second row does fold flat. Oh, and having batteries under the cargo floor also eliminates the spare tire, which is a huge bummer.
Regarding the suspension, both the 2020 Honda CR-V and CR-V Hybrid use a MacPherson strut in front with a multi-link design at the rear. Both CR-V variants come with low-friction dampers, plus tubular front and solid rear stabilizer bars. Dual-pinion, variable-ratio electric power steering provides the driver a “direct and satisfying feel,” according to Honda.
Related: On the road with the 2019 Honda Pilot.
How Much Horsepower Does The CR-V Hybrid Have?
Honestly speaking, the complicated nature of the powertrain makes it hard to gather a total power figure for the CR-V Hybrid. But according to Honda, peak output is 212 horsepower, which is 22 more horses than a conventional CR-V. However, you don’t buy a hybrid for the power output. Perhaps the primary reason for choosing the hybrid CR-V is the fuel savings. Honda didn’t reveal official EPA figures for the CR-V Hybrid, but it’s not difficult they say to achieve 45 mpg combined.
Pure Gasoline Power
The 2020 Honda CR-V also comes in pure gasoline trim, which I predict will remain the biggest seller. So, let’s take a break from all this technical brouhaha to discuss the normal powertrain, shall we? All non-hybrid CR-V models receive a 1.5-liter turbo four-cylinder engine. Complete with direct injection and Honda’s evergreen VTEC system, it produces 190 horsepower. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive, power is routed to a CVT automatic with Honda G-Shift control logic.

Rugged & Upscale Styling
The current-generation Honda CR-V is quite a looker, but the newest model has a more rugged and upscale vibe. The fog lights are now integrated into the front bumper while there’s a new and larger chrome grille. The gasoline CR-V has round LED fog lights while the hybrid gets bar-type fog lights with five LEDs each.
All CR-V models receive dark-tinted taillights; dark chrome treatments for the garnish below the rear glass; and tinted rear windows. The hybrid CR-V has a hidden tailpipe to achieve a “greener” countenance while gasoline models have a chrome exhaust. 18-inch wheels are standard while Touring models receive 19-inch rollers.
What Safety Features Does The 2020 Honda CR-V Have?
The 2020 Honda CR-V comes standard with Honda Sensing, a suite of advanced safety technologies. The package includes collision mitigation braking; forward collision warning with pedestrian sensing; road departure mitigation; lane departure warning; adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow; and lane-keeping assist.
Blind spot information, rear cross-traffic monitor, and automatic high beams are also available. The CR-V Hybrid’s Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System warns pedestrians when the vehicle is in EV mode. The system consists of a front bumper speaker that emits a distinct audible alert.

Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Honda CR-V will arrive this fall. Meanwhile, first deliveries of the CR-V Hybrid will commence in early 2020. Exact pricing and other relevant information is still forthcoming. Production of the CR-V Hybrid for the U.S. market will take place at Honda’s Greensburg, Indiana plant alongside the CR-V and Insight hybrid sedan.

2019/09/27,2019 Subaru STI S209: From The Nürburgring To Your Driveway,"The 2019 Subaru STI S209 represents the first-ever, STI S-line performance vehicle in the U.S.
The forthcoming STI S209 is directly inspired by the WRX STI Nürburgring Challenge race car.
Performance chassis includes flexible strut tower bars, draw stiffeners, and other modifications. 
Subaru’s in-house skunkworks, Subaru Tecnica International (or STI to those in the know) remains the top of the mountain when it comes to factory-made and approved go-fast cars. Now it seems there’s something above and beyond even the mighty STI. It’s called the STI S209, and it’s the first-ever, S-line STI car produced exclusively for the U.S. market. And it will set the tone for further S-line products to come. The 2019 Subaru STI S209 is like a super-duper version of the “normal” super-duper STI version of the WRX.
The WRX, as you (should) know, is Subie’s off-the-rack rally racer. It’s fabulous as is, but it’s even more fab when STI gets done with it. So you can only imagine what the STI S209 is like.
2019 Subaru STI S209: Inspired By The ‘Ring
The STI S209 gets thorough upgrades in power, handling, aerodynamics, and “driver engagement.” Engine modifications and bodywork alterations are performed ahead of time at the company’s assembly plant in Kiryu, Japan. As the name implies, there were other S cars, the 2000 S201 through the 2018 S208. Those were exclusive to the Japanese market, so this time around we’re lucky in the USA.
The S209 pulls a lot of tricks from the WRX STI Nürburgring Challenge race car, which won the SP3T class at the 2019 24 Hours of The ‘Ring. Like the race car, the S209 wears an expanded wide-body for its exterior. This bumps the vehicle’s overall width to 72.4 inches, 1.7 inches wider than a standard WRX STI. That wide-body treatment shelters the 265/35 Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT600A summer-only tires. Those tires are wrapped around lightweight, 19 x 9-inch forged BBS alloy wheels, running on a + 0.6-inch wider front and rear track. Dunlop developed the rubber exclusively for the S209. And yeah, they do pay off: maximum lateral grip of over 1.0 g says Subaru.
There are also vents on the front fenders for additional engine cooling. The vents on the rear fenders clear up some air turbulence which reduces drag and increases downforce. Hauling it down from speed is handled by Brembo brakes with cross-drilled steel rotors, and six-piston monoblock front calipers and two-piston monoblock rear calipers. Does Fuji Heavy Industries make trains? Cause this could stop one if they did.

Chassis & Engine Tech
In addition to brakes, tires, and that wider body, the S209 rides on special Bilstein dampers; stiffer coil springs; a 20mm rear stabilizer bar; and pillow-type bushings for the front and rear lateral links. The front cross-member and rear subframes are reinforced, but compliment a flexible front-strut tower bar and front/rear draw stiffeners. The draw stiffeners – as well as the rest of the suspension – improve stability, handling, and overall steering response. For example, the flexible tower bar, unlike a conventional rigid bar, is split and joined with a pillow ball joint in the center. This allows it to be, according to Subaru, more longitudinally mobile while also helping to laterally stiffen the car’s body.
There’s also front, rear, and side under spoilers and front bumper canards. The carbon-fiber roof panel and rear wing are nicked from the Nürburgring racecar.
The 2019 Subaru STI S209 uses a high-flow intake system with a new intake duct; an induction box with a conical air filter; a silicone turbo inlet duct; and a water spray system for lowering boost temperature via the steering-wheel paddles. Since there’s more air, that means more fuel, so the S209 gets a new high-flow fuel pump, larger injectors, and an STI-specific engine control module. The high-performance mufflers deliver 17 percent less resistance and connect to the hand-polished, 101mm diameter stainless-steel exhaust tips.
How Much Power Does The Subaru STI S209 Have?
Power? Have no fear, STI is here. The S209 is propelled by a reworked version of the EJ25 2.5-liter turbo BOXER (all caps) engine. An HKS turbocharger, with a larger turbine and compressor, plus a boost pressure of 18.9 psi, gives the engine 341 horsepower. The engine itself is adorned with an S209 serial number plate and, oh yeah, torque. How does 330 lb-ft. sound? Sounds good t’me.
In the gearbox department, the S209 comes exclusively with a close-ratio, six-speed manual transmission. It routes power to the full-time Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system with front/rear limited-slip differentials. There’s a Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD) with Active Torque Vectoring and Multi-Mode Vehicle Dynamics Control. The SI-Drive system is re-calibrated and offers three modes: Intelligent (I) for better fuel economy and smoother control; Sport (S) for more fun driving; and Sport Sharp (S#) for achieving the best acceleration times (and having more fun yet!). Personally, I would have labeled the last one “stupid” or “ridiculous” or something, but maybe that’s more of an Elon Musk thing?
Curiously, STI engineers say to go with Sport over Sport Sharp for circuit driving, as the less aggressive throttle map allows for greater control. So Sport for the track and Sport Sharp for the strip, got it?

Visual Treatments & Styling Cues
To set it apart, the S209 wears an STI badge in place of the traditional Subaru star cluster on the center of the D-shape steering wheel. That wheel is wrapped in Ultrasuede and stitched in silver, as is the lid of the center console. An S209 serial number badge sits on the center console, and S209 badges ornament the passenger dash and the headrests of the Recaro seats. On the exterior, special badges are on the front grille and fenders as well as the rear decklid.

2019 Subaru STI S209: Pricing & Availability
Now for the bad news: Only 209 units of the STI S209 will be built. All of them are coming stateside, but that’s not very many. The line? Go get in it now. Available colors and BBS wheel combinations are WR Blue Pearl/gray wheels and Crystal White Pearl/gold wheels. Pricing will be announced closer to the on-sale date later this year, but it will probably be very high, if there are any left at all. Sorry about that.

2019/09/27,2020 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth: Feeling The Scorpion’s Sting!,"The 2020 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth is even more fun for the new model year.
A new scorpion graphics package is sure to delight fans of the roadster.
We also take a look at the rest of the Fiat 124 Spider lineup for 2020. 
For those of us that like small, lightweight sports cars, the latest iteration of the Fiat 124 Spider presents a bit of a problem. It’s basically a 2020 Miata, so the problem is: should you buy this, or buy a Miata? The Fiat runs, turns, and stops about the same as its Japanese cousin, so why go with the Fiat? Perhaps this totally cool graphics package could help?
Graphics packages can be tricky things. Done right, they add a nice bit of verve to your ride. Done wrong and you can look like a 17-year-old with a Vin Diesel fetish. Or worse. You could end up with a screaming chicken on your hood.
Fiat 124 Spider: The Scorpion’s Sting
Luckily this graphics job was done by Italians, and we are, generally speaking, pretty good at graphics and design. Along with lunch, dinner, shoes, clothes, opera, and limited-run sports cars, it’s about the only other thing we’re good at these days; but be that as it may, check out the new “Scorpion Sting” Appearance Group for the 2020 Fiat 124 Spider. Pretty groovy, huh? It’s comprised of that big, off-center Abarth scorpion hood decal and those down-low side stripes all in Rosso red. And it’s only a $395.00 option.
I mean, how could you not buy it?
How Much Does The 2020 Fiat 124 Spider Cost?
With a starting price of only $25,390, the Fiat is hard to overlook. And for 2020, it’s not just this scorpion stripe package that’s new. Another available goodie for this year is the Record Monza Exhaust. For a paltry $995.00, your Fiat 124 Spider Abarth gets an unmistakable growl and a few more ponies (allegedly). There’s also the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth Veleno Appearance Group. That’s available for $495.00 and features red exterior mirror caps; a red lower fascia lip and front tow hook; Abarth-branded carpeted floor mats and a bright foot rest. There are also custom center-stripe design options, including Double Rally and Retro. Those are available across the range for $295.00.
The 2020 Fiat 124 Spider comes in three trim levels: Classica, Lusso, and Abarth. Starting at $25,390, the Classica features a dual-tip exhaust; black roll-bar; body-color header; side sills and door handles. The Classica comes standard with 16-inch alloy wheels; Nero premium cloth seats; halogen headlamps and LED taillamps. On the inside, there’s soft-touch materials on the instrument panel with light silver accents.

The Fiat 124 Spider Lusso starts at $28,145 and comes with 17-inch alloy wheels; silver-painted A-pillar header and roll-bar cover; and a dual-tip chrome exhaust. The interior, befitting that “luxury” name, features heated leather seats (these are a must) in Nero or Saddle, and a leatherette-wrapped cluster brow. The lower instrument panel is wrapped in leatherette with Piano Black accents throughout.
Abarth Treatments: Brembo Brakes & Recaro Seats
At the top of the hill is the 2020 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth. It starts under $30,000, which is less than a minivan and pretty much a deal all the way around. The Abarth cranks out 164 horsepower and rides on a front and rear Bilstein sport suspension. There’s a mechanical limited-slip diff, front strut tower bar, a Sport Mode selector, and a chrome quad-tip exhaust. Its more aggressive in appearance and comes complete with unique front and rear fascias; 17-inch Gun Metal aluminum wheels; Gun Metal exterior accents; and an available hand-painted hood stripe.
Other available features include Brembo brakes and Recaro seats. Yes, you should get these.
Related: Growly pipes and rally stripes: meet the 2019 Fiat 124 Spider.
What Engine Does The Fiat 124 Spider Have?
The standard mill for the roadster is a 1.4-liter MultiAir Turbo. The four-cylinder engine puts out 164 horsepower and 184 lb-ft. of torque. It’s available with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The 124 Spider rides on a double-wishbone suspension in front, and a multi-link in the rear, tuned for greater stability while braking and turning. The steering is light and responsive and uses an electric power-assist dual pinion system.
No, it’s not all bare bones. There’s a buffet of safety and security features like LED adaptive front headlamps, Blind-spot Monitoring, Rear Cross Path detection, and a ParkView rear backup camera. Tech features include Keyless Enter ‘n Go, Bluetooth connectivity, an available Bose nine-speaker audio system, and a seven-inch touchscreen display.
So yeah, why not buy a Fiat 124 Spider over a Miata?

2019/09/27,2020 Ford Super Duty: The Workhorse For The City of Tomorrow,"The Ford Super Duty is not going quietly into the night. As the State Fair of Texas gets underway, Ford is showcasing the numbers on their new heavy hauler. In short, the 2020 Ford Super Duty is a monster. In a longer-term sense, a magnet and a strong one at that. It’s safe to say Ford will use the new performance figures to entice buyers away from GM and Ram. Ford is also using the occasion to get back to their roots, or so it seems anyway. Yes, the 2020 Ford Super Duty is packed with connectivity and tech stuff – all these trucks are today; but the 2020 Super Duty’s numbers suggest Ford is ever-conscious of those who buy a truck simply for the hitch and bed.
For example, the Super Duty retains the highest market share among demanding industries and professions. According to Ford’s analysis of IHS Markit TIPNet U.S. registration data (January 2017 – June 2019), the Super Duty’s market share in mining is over 60 percent; emergency vehicles and services at 50 percent; and construction and other skilled trades coming in at nearly 50 percent.
2020 Ford Super Duty: Setting The Stage
During the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) here in Detroit, Ford’s display is always one of the most elaborate. It’s usually two levels, complete with games and simulators and all their best candy, from Shelby Mustangs to Raptor trucks. When Ford says they want to be known as a technology company, or a mobility company, their modern display at NAIAS reflects as much. What’s interesting is how that bent toward cutting-edge technology and future mobility merges under the hood of one of their most recognizable and significant products: that is the 2020 Super Duty.
In the City of Tomorrow, Ford hopes to reduce pollution, congestion, and ineffective means of transit. Autonomous and electric vehicles, ride sharing services, and other types of “connected mobility” are brought into the conversation. Ford is partnering with a coalition of mayors and Bloomberg Philanthropies for the ambitious endeavor. And while everyone may be hard at work on our future home, today Ford is doing what any Detroit automaker worth their weight in salt does. Producing big, powerful trucks for America’s working class.
After all, somebody has gotta build that city.
“Super Duty customers have demanding and diverse needs – from towing heavy trailers to repairing critical infrastructure,” explained Kumar Galhotra, Ford President, North America. “Productivity is their lifeblood and their truck is their biggest tool.”

“Ford truck customers are building a better world with Super Duty and we’re helping them work even harder with the most available diesel towing, payload, torque, and power you can get in a heavy-duty pickup,” explained Mike Pruitt, Super Duty Chief Engineer. “We’ve surpassed the kilotorque barrier and made it standard with every pickup truck featuring a Power Stroke diesel engine.”
How Powerful Is The 2020 Ford Super Duty?
As it stands now, the 2020 Ford Super Duty will provide best-in-class diesel towing, power, and torque; best-in-class gasoline power and torque; and best-in-class payload. In terms of diesel towing, Ford will claim all three methods with the 2020 Super Duty: conventional, fifth-wheel, and gooseneck. For the latter, hitch mounts are installed at the factory. Moving the brick and mortar of the City of Tomorrow requires big numbers, and the right factory outfits to do so.
At the top of the mountain is the reining 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel engine. Under the hood of the new Super Duty, it generates 475 horsepower and 1,050 lbs-ft. of torque. The engine pairs with a new 10-speed TorqShift automatic. When properly-equipped, the 6.7 Power Stroke has a maximum conventional tow rating of 24,200 lbs.; maximum fifth-wheel rating of 32,500 lbs.; and gooseneck capability up to 37,000 lbs. The numbers surpass comparable offerings from GM and Ram. To put things into perspective, a properly-configured F-450 could tow nearly 31 American quarter horses at 1,200 lbs. apiece.
On the gasoline side, the available 7.3-liter V8 cranks out 430 horsepower and 475 lbs-ft. of torque. When properly-equipped, the standard 6.2-liter gas offers a maximum payload capacity of 7,850 lbs. The numbers again surpass comparable offerings from GM and Ram.
The new Tremor Off-Road Package with the 6.7 Power Stroke returns a maximum conventional tow rating of 15,000 lbs.; 21,900 lbs. for gooseneck applications. The Tremor package with a 7.3 gas offers a maximum payload capacity of 4,210 lbs.
Running The Gauntlet
Ford is known for their “torture tests,” a series of brutal, intense, and even ludicrous outings that subject a truck to its absolute limit. One of the more famous ones from 2011 pits EcoBoost Engine 448AA against Homestead-Miami Speedway. The F-150 EcoBoost runs for 24 hours around the track, only stopping for fuel and tire changes while towing at max capacity. Suffice it to say, nothing has changed in Ford truck land, and the 2020 Super Duty arrives as the most tested in the company’s history.
Prior to its debut, the 2017 Super Duty logged more than 12 million test miles. The 2020 Super Duty covered that, plus another seven million. Torture tests this time included running the truck around the clock under extreme loads, and through all kinds of environmental conditions using dynos, test tracks, and public roads. In fact, because the durability test tracks are so unforgiving and jarring, robot drivers are sometimes used in favor of humans.

Technology & Connectivity Treatments
The available Pro Trailer Backup Assist will help when maneuvering trailers to and fro. Drivers use a knob instead of the steering wheel to better position their trailer via the reverse camera. Trailer Reverse Guidance shows the angle and direction, and provides steering suggestions to most efficiently direct a trailer backward. The technology accommodates all conventional, fifth-wheel, and gooseneck applications.

Elsewhere in the cab, the 2020 Ford Super Duty provides a 4G LTE modem with Wi-Fi access for up to 10 devices. Wireless charging and USB-C ports are also available.
Manufacturing & Availability
The 2020 Ford Super Duty will start shipping to dealers by year-end, being manufactured at the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville; and the Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake. In the meantime, the 2020 Ford Super Duty is on display inside the Truck Zone at the State Fair of Texas, now through October 20th.

2019/09/25,"2020 Nissan Murano, Pathfinder & Armada: An Easy Pricing & Features Guide","Nissan has let the cat out of the bag for their top three SUV/crossovers for 2020, the Murano, Pathfinder, and Armada. As you would expect from an outfit like Nissan, they’re not nearly as expensive as the content would lead you to believe. Which one you put in your driveway will depend on what your family needs exactly. The Murano seats five, while the Pathfinder holds seven, and the Armada can accommodate eight. This short guide will help you if you are shopping for a Nissan SUV in the near future.
In you need something smaller than one of these three, we recommend the Nissan Kicks.
2020 Nissan Murano
Let’s deal with the lighter offering first, the Murano. Like the Italian city it is named after, the Murano aims for elegance and style more than off-road capability. Sure, you can take it down 10 miles of logging road, but you most likely won’t so why worry about that stuff? However, it’s ideal for commuting, running errands around town, and getting the family where they need to be during the week.
The 2020 Nissan Murano will start at $32,575 for the S front-wheel drive model. As you can probably guess, the S is the entry-level trim. The entire Murano lineup is available in four grades for 2020. There’s the S, SV, SL, and Platinum at the top of the heap. All of them are powered by a 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter DOHC V6 mated to an Xtronic transmission. You get your choice of front-wheel or all-wheel drive across the range.
Safety Tech & New Colors
This third generation Murano has undergone a wide-ranging refresh over the 2019 model. The exterior and interior are revised with the expanded availability of Nissan’s Safety Shield 360, a suite of six advanced active safety and driver-assist technologies. New option packages are also on offer, and you can even get a new exterior color: Super Black.
Here’s a handy pricing and trim level chart for the 2020 Nissan Murano.
2020 Nissan Murano
(Trim Level & Drivetrain) MSRP w/ Destination ($1,045)
S FWD $32,575
SV FWD $36,205
SL FWD $40,675
Platinum FWD $44,775
S AWD $34,175
SV AWD $37,805
SL AWD $42,275
Platinum AWD $46,375
2020 Nissan Pathfinder
No one is going to accuse the Pathfinder of being a soft crossover only suited for picking up the kids after school. Sure, you’re probably going to be using the Pathfinder for just that, but if you want to (or have to) take the thing down some muddy, sodden track during the wee hours of the night, in the middle of a Roland Emmerich-level storm, the Pathfinder will handle it with a good-natured shrug.

Like it’s Murano sibling, the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder starts at a completely reasonable $32,725. The Pathfinder is a seven-passenger, half-track-shaped ride that comes in two-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations. You have your choice of four grades: S, SV, SL, and Platinum. For 2020, Nissan will continue to offer the well-equipped Rock Creek Edition. The Rock Creek Edition is a special value package (maybe why it’s so popular?) with unique exterior and interior treatments. It is available for the SV and SL grades. Also standard on the Rock Creek Edition is a trailer tow hitch and splash guards.
Under The Hood & In The Cabin
All Pathfinders get a beefier engine than the Murano: a 284-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 with Nissan’s Direct Injection Gasoline (DIG) system. Said mill is hooked up to an Xtronic transmission. This adds up to a maximum towing capacity of 6,000 lbs., giving it enough to move any two-axle recreational trailers you may have.
The interior of the Pathfinder features Nissan’s EZ Flex Seating System with “Latch and Glide,” a second row tilt-and-glide seat that gets you third row access easy-peasy, even with a car seat. Other available features include the Intelligent Around View Monitor; Bose 13-speaker audio system; Dual Panorama Moonroof; power liftgate with position memory; and NissanConnect with Navigation and Services.
Here’s a handy pricing and trim level chart for the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder.

S 4WD $34,415
SV 4WD $37,205
SL 4WD $40,825
Platinum 4WD $45,655
2020 Nissan Armada
At the top of the heap (especially in terms of size) we find the 2020 Nissan Armada. Big and capacious, the Armada starts just shy of $48,500 but you do get a lot of features packed into what is an already sizable and capable SUV. Nissan’s flagship SUV is designed for large and/or growing families with seating for up to eight and tons of flexible cargo space in either a 4WD or 2WD setup. The 2020 Armada comes in a choice of four grade levels: SV, SL, Platinum, and Platinum Reserve.
Related: A guide to understanding your Nissan warranty and if you have enough.
Power comes from a 5.6-liter Endurance V8 cranking out 390 horsepower and offering up 8,500 lbs. of towing capacity. There’s a 22-inch Wheel Package with 22×8-inch, 14-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels and 275/50R22 all-season tires. Heated outside mirrors are now standard on all trim levels.
The Laundry List of Features
The Armada has many, many advanced technology systems on offer for 2020. There’s the standard Intelligent Rear View Mirror that uses a high-resolution, rear-mounted camera. It projects a clear image onto the rearview mirror via an LCD monitor that’s built-in. Not to worry Luddites, a switch allows you to access either the traditional rearview mirror system or the Intelligent Rear View Mirror.

2019/09/21,VSI Labs To Conduct Further Autonomous Testing On Drive East,"Fresh off their Automated Drive West, the team from Minnesota-based VSI Labs will now head in the opposite direction. The Automated Drive East will cover approximately 1,000 miles between their Minneapolis office and Washington D.C. Similar to their trip west, VSI will be testing state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle technology. “There is always an edge case,” explained Phil Magney, VSI Founder and Principal Advisor. “The only way you are going to discover those is by accumulating miles.”
VSI Labs: What They Do & Who They Are
VSI builds vehicles to examine how different technologies interact with each other; and to better understand how they function when it comes to autonomous driving. VSI’s engineering team routinely analyzes by-wire control systems, sensor fusion applications, and precision localization; each important to the inner-workings of an autonomous vehicle. From there, VSI offers various research portals that support product and technology planning; competitive analysis and IP discovery; and product engineering and development. Today VSI has examined thousands of products and represented over 800 companies, from Silicon Valley startups to multinational OEMs.
The company consists of a small but diverse team back at their office in the Twin Cities. Engineers on staff help develop AI software and test frameworks and algorithms, among other specialties. There are those on staff responsible for research and client partnerships, along with technical content creation and marketing.
VSI Labs: The Cross-Country Test Car
In August, VSI conducted a 2,000-mile journey as part of the Automated Drive West. The team traveled to Santa Clara, California for the Drive World conference. The journey exposed their test car, a 2018 Ford Fusion with a Dataspeed by-wire control system, to a variety of terrains and weather conditions. Heading west, VSI examined and evaluated things like precision lane models and advanced GPS technology; the goal being to improve the performance and safety of both systems as they relate to autonomous driving.
“I just want to emphasize that we aren’t out to prove anything here, that’s not what we’re doing,” Magney told us before leaving in August. “We’re researchers; it’s all about discovery, understanding the limits, and finding the gaps when it comes to automated driving.”
Among the high-tech systems within the VSI test Fusion is a special Linux computer, custom-built by the engineering team. This computer is essentially the brain, acting as the central controller for the car’s on-board autonomous driving systems. As the test vehicle’s most vital organ, the VSI team has come up with clever ways of protecting it. “The computer gear we have in the trunk generates a lot of heat, so we adapted the HVAC system to provide proper cooling,” Magney said.
Automated Drive East: The Technology
On the journey west, VSI looked primarily at the combination of HERE Technologies’ high-definition maps with Real Time Kinematics; a ground-based positioning technology. Going east, the team will employ Trimble’s precise-point positioning technology, or Trimble RTX. Proponents of RTX say it’s a viable option for delivering accurate GNSS corrections via satellite; it’s also a key component of Cadillac’s Super Cruise feature. In a nutshell, Super Cruise can automatically steer, brake, and keep the vehicle positioned on the highway in certain, optimal conditions. The system uses high precision LiDAR map and GPS data, an advanced driver attention system, and a network of camera and radar sensors.
Translation: RTX technology helps vehicles – autonomous or otherwise – better know and understand their exact location.
“Because we are driving cross-country; because there is very little infrastructure on the open road, it’s very difficult to do landmark localization,” Magney said. “Therefore you have to rely on other technologies like RTX which gets its calculations from satellites rather than land-based sources.”
The Importance of Localizing
The notion of HD map-based lane-keeping is a relatively new idea for autonomous vehicle applications. Lane-keeping technology as we know it – mostly what is in the cars we drive now – relies on vision systems, like a camera, to maintain road position. Engineers call this “localizing” or rather the car knows its “location” at any given time. In this particular example, the vehicle’s camera would localize by “seeing” the actual lane markings. However, for cars with higher levels of autonomy, a more comprehensive solution is necessary; meaning, what if for some reason, the lane markings cannot be seen. Vision-based lane-keeping systems, while still effective by and large, are compromised in such situations.
Conversely, the combination of HERE HD map data; and being able to localize in real-time with Trimble RTX will help the VSI test vehicle stay on its intended path (and not cross the center lanes) regardless of visibility.
“This journey is about understanding the performance of these two complimentary technologies when subjected to variable conditions,” Magney said. “As the leading research company on active safety and automated driving, it’s our job to test the various technologies available to the industry, and there’s no better way to do that than driving cross-country.”
Knowledge Gained, An Algorithm Applied
On the Automated Drive East, the team will be watching for one particular correction they made after arriving back from out west. While on the way to California, the team noticed passing a semi truck would sometimes prove problematic. The aerodynamic drag coming off the rig would sometimes interrupt the test vehicle’s intended and computed path.
“These are the edge cases we are taking about which you only discover by putting miles on,” Magney explained. “We have applied some things to the algorithms in the test car on the control side to minimize that now.”
Follow The Automated Drive East
The Automated Drive East begins on Friday, September 27th. The VSI team will make the trip in two days, passing through Chicago and Pittsburgh on the way to Washington D.C. You can follow the journey in real-time on social media, either through the VSI Labs Twitter and/or Facebook page.
“We’re thrilled to support VSI’s research with Trimble RTX and look forward to being a part of the Drive East,” added Marcus McCarthy, Director of Autonomous Navigation Solutions at Trimble. “This is a great opportunity for us to further validate Trimble RTX’s contribution to the safety and performance of autonomous and semi-autonomous driving solutions.”

2019/09/19,2020 Cadillac CT4: Reviving The American Sports Sedan,"Cadillac unveils the new CT4 after releasing the CT4-V a couple of months back.
It arrives with a pair of turbocharged engines with all-wheel drive as an option.
The new CT4 is also available with Super Cruise for semi-autonomous driving.
General Motor’s Cadillac subsidiary has reached the crossroads. A few months back, Cadillac unleashed the new CT4-V, a high-performance derivative of the then-incoming CT4 sports sedan. And while it’s unusual to release high-performing variants of a new car ahead of the normal model, Cadillac insists on doing it anyway. And it got us thinking. Perhaps the brand is onto something promising here with the 2020 Cadillac CT4?
It’s too early to tell if Cadillac’s new CT4-V is good enough to unseat BMW’s M-Series, or perhaps ruffle the feathers of the Mercedes-AMG line. Or, my personal favorite, the Geneis G70 sedan. All we know is Cadillac came up with the unexpected – an entry-level, sport luxury sedan that might deliver the moon. In a world where lumpy crossovers and SUVs are dominating sales charts, here is Cadillac proposing a different approach to new-age mobility; or up until Cadillac gives us a taste of a fully-electric car.
Is the 2020 Cadillac CT4 a new approach in reviving the American sports sedan? Perhaps. Let’s take a look.
2020 Cadillac CT4: Styled To Perform
Cadillacs are known for their tailfins, but you don’t get those with the new CT4. Instead, you get a sleek profile with angular creases and bold lines – call them the tailfins of a new generation. It has longer “dash-to-front-axle proportions” to take full advantage of the rear-wheel-drive architecture. The Cadillac CT4 has a wider stance to give it some presence on the road. In other words, Cadillac is aiming for a younger crowd with the new design.
“We developed CT4 to appeal to youthful buyers in the luxury market who may be new to the Cadillac brand,” said Andrew Smith, Executive Director of Global Cadillac design. “The vehicle was intended to draw attention, using a combination of great proportions, taut surfacing, and Cadillac family details that hint at the athletic driving experience this vehicle offers.”
How the strategy works out in the long run is beyond us, but there’s no mistaking the Cadillac DNA. With unique grille designs and bright exterior accents, the CT4 is a fusion between old and new. Admittedly, the car is not as sleek or as slippery as the Mercedes CLA or Genesis G70, but the new CT4 is like a brute in a suit if you catch my drift. Furthermore, CT4 Sport models receive darker exterior accents and performance-inspired details like unique grille designs, rocker extensions, sportier wheels, and a rear spoiler.

Got Boost?
The primary reason the CT4-V got our attention is the 325-horsepower, 2.7-liter turbocharged motor. If you think that’s too much power, the new CT4’s other engine options may be more to your liking. Base models receive a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder, producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. Power is fed to an eight-speed automatic driving the rear wheels. For all intents and purposes, the base CT4 produces more power than an Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz CLA, and you can have all-wheel drive in all trim levels of the CT4.
Meanwhile, premium CT4 models have a de-tuned version of the 2.7-liter mill in the CT4-V. It produces 309 horsepower and 348 ft-lb. of torque. This more powerful engine makes good use of a 10-speed automatic. No word yet on performance specs, but we reckon the CT4 will be fast enough to run with the Genesis G70 and others in the segment.
2020 Cadillac CT4: Solid Driving Dynamics
You see, introducing the CT4-V ahead of the base variant is implying a lot. For starters, Cadillac is saying it wants their offerings in the family sedan category to be fun and exciting. Next, the new CT4 comes loaded with all the crucial elements of a great-handling car. It has a near-perfect 50:50 weight distribution between axles for a sportier and more nimble driving experience. The front, double-pivot MacPherson suspension has dual lower ball joints to improve overall driving dynamics.
“Cadillac is dedicated to building the most exhilarating sport-luxury sedans,” said Rob Kotarak, Cadillac Chief Engineer. “Every element of the CT4 is designed to bring innovative technologies right to the driver, providing discerning driving dynamics with cutting edge precision.”
All CT4 models receive an adjustable ZF Multi-Valve System (passive dampers); a Bosch rack-mounted electric power steering system; and robust eBoost brakes with Duralife-coated rotors. (Duralife in GM-speak means ferritic nitrocarburizing for the rotors). From there, selectable drive modes can alter the behavior of the steering, suspension, and exhaust. Cadillac is doing this all in the name of sporty performance.
Premium & Refined Interior
Despite the sportier and more athletic demeanor, the CT4 is still very much a Cadillac. Expect a premium and refined interior, which should be a cut above other GM cars. Cabin touchpoints are either genuine cowhide or soft plastics to deliver a posh vibe. There’s the usual eight-inch diagonal touchscreen display, while the driver receives a full-color dual display and instrument cluster.
Standard features for the 2020 Cadillac CT4 include keyless entry with push-button start; a leather-wrapped steering wheel; an HD rear vision camera; LED interior lighting, LED headlights and taillights; dual-zone climate control (with humidity sensors and particulate filters); and a premium audio system. Cadillac’s Super Cruise, a semi-autonomous driver assistance feature, is optional.

2019/09/17,2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA: Entry-Level Benz Packs Tech & Performance,"The 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA is an ideal, entry-level luxury vehicle.
Technology options are numerous, including the new MBUX interface.
A more powerful turbo engine joins the model range for the new year.
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA is one of those four-door “coupe” deals that, apart from driving me nuts by Mercedes trying to call a four door a coupe, actually seems to work. Like all Mercedes-Benz products, it’s dripping with in-car technology, like the MBUX control system. MBUX for the 2020 CLA comes with a new interface and natural speech recognition tech. Similar to all Mercedes-Benz cars, it’s as safe as a bank vault and performs well; only the new CLA (and this is different) won’t break the bank.
2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA: Solid Entry-Level Offering
The bottom line here is that the 2020 CLA 250 will start at $36,650. The CLA 250 4MATIC, that’s the all-wheel drive version, starts at $38,650. See? Not all that bad for something with a three-pointed star. The CLA Coupe was the first compact Mercedes-Benz on the market when it arrived in the United States in 2013. According to Mercedes-Benz, at peak times, more than two thirds of CLA buyers in the U.S. came from competitors. On average, CLA customers are around 10 years younger than the typical Mercedes-Benz buyer.
Given the price point and the available technology, it makes sense.
The Mercedes-Benz CLA also comes with additional standard equipment for 2020. LED headlamps and taillamps; a big panoramic roof and 18-inch wheels; smartphone Integration, and a seven-inch digital Instrument cluster/media display are all on the list.

Tech On Wheels
Besides being graced with a modern design, the CLA fits lots of tech into a small and reasonably-priced package. There’s the natural voice command interface, improved aerodynamics, and a slew of new driver assistance systems. The dashboard has a trick free-standing widescreen display along with the now commonplace touchscreen.
Now, about that standard MBUX interface. It’s actually pretty well thought out and usable; the only bad thing is that tragic name. MBUX, if you really want to know, stands for Mercedes-Benz User Experience. Essentially it’s how you interact with the various in-car operations and communications. Merc says that’s all thanks to the system’s powerful computer; brilliant screens and graphics; customizable display; and software that can learn. Voice Control with natural language understanding, an available full-color heads-up display, and Augmented Video for Navigation are also part of MBUX.

Mercedes-Benz says the system “surpasses conventional automotive standards” by making various in-vehicle functions more intuitive. I’ll leave the final judgment on that up to you.
Power & Performance
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA comes with a 2.0 liter, inline-four turbo engine that puts out 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. That’s a bump of 13 horsepower compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, the new CLA’s track is wider for a lower center of gravity. Exact measurements come in at an extra 63 mm at the front and 55 mm more at the rear versus the prior model. Mercedes keeps talking about how the wider track and lower center of gravity give the car its sportiest driving characteristics yet.
Again, I will let you be the final judge on that.
To assist with the driving dynamics, the new CLA uses a decoupled multi-link rear axle, a larger stabilizer bar, and an optional active adaptive damping system. In terms of aerodynamics, the 2020 CLA underwent more testing and simulation, and ultimately spent more time in the wind tunnel versus the outgoing model.
S-Class Treatments For Less
Safety and performance nannies abound in the 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA. The car is able to drive semi-autonomously, for a start, thanks to camera and radar system improvements that allow it to see up to 500 meters ahead (that’s around 1600 feet). The CLA also uses map and navigation data to support various driver assistance functions. For example, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC, as part of the optional Driver Assistance Package, provides route-based support and will proactively adjust the speed when approaching bends, junctions, or roundabouts. Much of this new technology is lifted directly from the S-Class, which seems to make the CLA even more of a bargain.
2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA: Pricing & Availability
The new Mercedes-Benz CLA will go on sale in the U.S. later this year. With that starting price in the mid-30k range, I’d expect to see more than a few of them around.

2019/09/12,AutoSens Brussels 2019 To Examine All Aspects of Vehicle Perception Tech & Autonomous Driving,"AutoSens returns to Brussels, Belgium for its flagship conference on autonomous driving.
The event features over 60 presentations, seven panel discussions, and a technology exhibition.
AutoSens is a way for senior level engineers and researchers to see what is happening in the industry.  
The renowned Autoworld Museum will host AutoSens Brussels next week; the global conference on autonomous driving and vehicle perception technology returns to Belgium beginning Tuesday, September 17th. The conference examines and covers nearly every level of self-driving and vehicle perception technology, from the supply chain and product development, to plausible use-cases and eventual implementation. AutoSens, in essence, takes a deep dive into the engineering, legal, financial, and even ethical challenges and implications of autonomous cars.
“We strive to bring a really high quality of technical presentations to AutoSens every year, so all attendees will go back to their office or lab with some new solutions, food for thought, or novel information,” said Robert Stead, Managing Director, Sense Media Group, the parent company of AutoSens. “The audience joining us at Autoworld is as healthy as ever, with the world’s best imaging and computer vision engineers and scientists hard at work pursuing the shared goal of safer roads and sustainable technology for the future of transportation.”
For Engineers, By Engineers
Every aspect of AutoSens lives by this motto – for engineers, by engineers – meaning the technical integrity and depth of the conference is of the upmost importance. Collaboration and creativity remain central themes as well, whereby professionals in the field share ideas and devise solutions to the obstacles facing autonomous driving. Organizers say they want attendees to feel welcome, and to have an accurate representation of how the industry is evolving.
“AutoSens exists simply to support and help engineers and scientists, and when we hear stories from attendees about the new people they met, the things they learned, the business connections made – that’s what keeps us motivated,” Stead explained. “It’s about creating a meeting place and community that can be a catalyst for others in their pursuit of good science. We also want to provide context so the technical discussions show an up-to-date picture of what is happening in the market.”
“This conference has been good for us because we meet like-minded people that are facing similar challenges; we talk, we exchange our views, and we learn from each other,” added Phil Magney, Founder and Principal Advisor, VSI Labs, and a longtime attendee. “We like AutoSens because it’s technical and focused with respect to the perception side of this business, and it’s a good mix of industry and technology.”

AutoSens Brussels 2019 Agenda: At A Glance
In its entirety, AutoSens Brussels includes over 60 presentations, seven panel discussions, and a technology exhibition with 40 plus displays; all surrounded by timeless classic cars inside the Autoworld Museum. Midday lunches and a drinks reception Tuesday evening are among the many chances for networking and discussion. The AutoSens Awards dinner is set for Wednesday night at the Atomium in Brussels.
AutoSens Brussels 2019 Agenda: Expert Speakers
The robust agenda for Brussels begins on Tuesday, September 17th with a session entitled AI and Deep Learning for Driverless Vehicles: Trends and Challenges. Dominique Bonte, Managing Director of ABI Research, will lead the session on lightweight, low-power automotive AI systems and new testing approaches for them. Later in the day, representatives from AEye, Arbe, FLIR, and SOS Lab will host a comprehensive round table discussion on LiDAR, thermal cameras, and other ADAS technologies.
On Wednesday and Thursday, September 18th and 19th, a number of expert speakers will take the stage, including Geoff Ballew, Senior Director of Marketing for ON Semiconductor. Ballew’s presentation will cover the challenges and requirements for state-of-the-art sensors across specific applications: e-mirror and camera monitoring systems (CMS); driver and occupant monitoring systems (DMS); and scalable machine vision for ADAS, on up to fully-autonomous driving solutions. While this is only one of over 60 different presentations scheduled, attendees can expect a thorough analysis of the topics at hand.
“The difference between AutoSens and many other events on this hot topic of self-driving cars is that the AutoSens attendees are the actual engineers who are building the systems that will make it all possible,” Stead said. “We try to find the leading minds in the field because they have the experience and can provide that level of insight.”
Other presenters in Brussels this year include Dexin Chen, Senior Technology Analyst, IHS Markit; Dr. Valentina Donzella, Associate Professor, University of Warwick; Professor Robin Jenkin, Principal Image Quality Engineer, NVIDIA; and Christian Moczko, Supplier Quality Engineer, Daimler – among many others.
AutoSens Expands Further
The return to Brussels marks the 7th edition of AutoSens, launched four years ago by Sense Media Group. The conference is a twice-yearly event, meeting in Detroit, Michigan every May and in Brussels in September. Beginning next year, AutoSens Hong Kong will join the events in North America and Europe. Organizers say Asia is an important market for autonomous technology, and an international hub for engineers, researchers, and other automotive experts. Longtime attendees, delegates, and speakers agree with the decision.

“AutoSens has quickly established itself as the event in this space to see, hear and meet the key companies and people that matter in the autonomous vehicle sector,” explained Rudy Burger, Managing Partner, Woodside Capital Partners, and frequent AutoSens speaker. “Launching a third edition in Hong Kong is an exciting and valuable proposition for the industry.”
“I can’t think of a better combination,” added Abhay Rai, VP of Product Marketing, Visteon. “The latest innovations from Asia, the backdrop of one of the world’s most famous cities, and the global AutoSens community convening for the latest addition to the world-class event series.”
Continued Industry Support For Hong Kong 
AutoSens Hong Kong already has a number of highly invested stakeholders. Expert advisory board members include representation from Aptiv, Byton, Valeo, Visteon, and Robert Bosch with founding partners from top companies such as Visteon, IAV Automotive Engineering, Siemens, OmniVision, Kalray, ON Semiconductor, Viavi, Woodside Capital Partners, and XenomatiX.
“We are incredibly proud to announce 13 founding partners and advisory supporters,” Stead said. “It’s very encouraging to see the level of support that’s been shown upon sharing our vision for the next phase of the AutoSens journey.”
Organizers are still developing the agenda for AutoSens Hong Kong, but say attendees can expect sessions on sensor hardware, image processing, driver monitoring, computer vision, and regulatory challenges. AutoSens Hong Kong will feature over 300 delegates, 45 speakers, and nearly 12 hours of networking. The conference runs November 17th through the 19th of next year.
AutoSens Brussels 2019: Location & Tickets
Tickets for AutoSens Brussels 2019, including discount packages for females in the engineering community, are available now. The conference begins Tuesday, September 17th and runs through Thursday the 19th. Those wanting to keep up on everything from afar can do so via the official AutoSens TV channel. There viewers will find archived presentations from past conferences, along with interviews with many of the attendees, delegates, and speakers.
“We try really hard to create an environment that is different and stands out from the crowd,” Stead said. “Only by sharing knowledge and resources can we address the many great challenges posed as we work towards a world of autonomous vehicles.”

2019/09/11,Dodge Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition: Fit For The King,"Quick question. If you’re going to celebrate the 50th anniversary of one of your performance cars, how much horsepower is enough? Let’s say you are making the Dodge Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition, with an upgraded version of the Hellcat engine, just how much horsepower do you stuff under the hood?
A lot.
Too much.
717.
All of the above.
If you’re Dodge, the answer to that question is simple.
Here Comes Trouble
At this point, it’s pretty easy to say that Dodge isn’t interested in subtle design concepts. Fifty years ago, this was true with almost every last product they were making. Today, it still is true considering their 50th Anniversary Edition of the Charger Daytona. For 2020, the Daytona will be packing 717 ponies. Is that enough? Yes. If that’s not enough, then I have two things to say: 1 – Seek help, and 2 – You’re my kind of people. Oh and third, you might want this Dodge muscle car instead.
Fifty years ago, the Dodge Charger Daytona landed like a well-aimed mortar round. The Allisons, Wood Brothers, Yarboroughs (both of them) took one look and more or less said, “Hooh boy, we are in trouble now!” The original Daytona pretty much dominated NASCAR. Yes, Richard Petty was always hard to beat, regardless of car, but put him in a Daytona and adios muchachos. The Daytona was the first car to break a 200 mph average lap speed, a record that stood for 17 years.
Dodge Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition: Fit For The King
Officially it’s called the 2020 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition, although most will shorten that. Leveraging what they did with the Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody (still the most powerful and fastest sedan in the world), Dodge added 3.5 inches of width; complete with wider wheels and tires that give off an aggressive, planted stance not unlike something predatory that is about to eat you. That’s just where the changes start. Other upgrades include enhanced shift points up to 6,100 rpm in automatic mode. That alone was enough to bump the horsepower from 707 to 717; the feature is exclusive to this model Charger.
Also exclusive is the color B5 Blue. It bears more than a passing resemblance to Petty’s Electric Blue. Sure, the Anniversary Edition also comes in Pitch Black, Triple Nickel, and White Knuckle, but c’mon; just go ahead and order the B5 Blue. The King would want it that way.

Exterior Design
In addition to the paint, other “traditional” styling cues include a Daytona decklid with a rear-quarter decal and spoiler. The Daytona decal, spoiler, and Hellcat badge come in white on the B5 Blue, Pitch Black, and Triple Nickel. White Knuckle models get the Daytona decal and spoiler in blue, whereby the Hellcat badge has a bright finish.
Finishing up the outside are these big, stonking 20- by 11-inch “Warp Speed” wheels with a slick Satin Carbon finish. They are wrapped in Pirelli 305/35ZR20 all-season performance tires. Three-season tires are optional, and yeah, go with that option. Because if you’re driving this in the rain . . . yeah, sure, you’re my kind of people, but you’re gonna die! Keep this as a summer fun car, if you please. Stopping is handled by Brembo six-piston front and four-piston rear brakes with vented rotors. Stopping was kind of an iffy deal back in the day with Mopars, so this is good news.
Interior Treatments
The interior gets its fair share of Daytona styling cues. Heated and ventilated black Nappa leather, and Alcantara suede with blue accent stitching and Daytona embroidery are the first things I noticed. Both front seats have a 12-way power adjust function. That blue accent stitch appears throughout the interior, on the center console armrest, on the door panels, and on the dashboard and shifter. The headliner is this special Dynamica Suede affair, and that’s real carbon fiber on the instrument panel and console bezels, kiddo.
Light Black Chrome interior accents are matched with the suede-wrapped, flat-bottom steering wheel. The steering wheel gets blue and silver accent stitching. Premium velour-bound floor mats, again with a blue-stitched accent border, help complete the interior look. Yes, both the steering wheel and floor mats are exclusive to the Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition.
Dodge Charger Daytona 50th Anniversary Edition: Availability
There’s also a custom IP badge with the Hellcat and Daytona logos on the passenger side identifying each vehicle as “x out of 501.” So yeah, that’s some bad news: Only 501 will be made. So get in line now. The line will start to move this fall as the Chargers will arrive early next year. The 501 designation comes from 1969 when Dodge built 501 of them to meet NASCAR’s homologation requirements so they could qualify for racing.
Seriously. Consider it.

2019/09/10,2020 Audi S7: A Quick Look At This New Sportback,"The 2020 Audi S7 arrives with more power under the hood and more tech inside. 
An on-board, 48V electric compressor helps boosts low-end torque for acceleration. 
Starting MSRP for the S7, depending on trim level, is between $84,000 and $90,000. 
So you’re a success. You’ve made some money, have a small family, and a disposition for speed. Time for a new car, but you don’t want an SUV; you want something classy. Something refined. Something that says “I’ve made it and I’m here.” Something like a sedan perhaps, only more so? Then the 2020 Audi S7 might be your ticket. That would be the sportier version of their big four door coupe.
Here is a quick walk around Audi’s new Sportback.
2020 Audi S7: The Sportback Design Stays Put
Audi says, right up front, that the S7 is a five-door coupe enhanced with S model design elements. That’s a lie, but I will not belabor the fact that coupes have two (and only two) doors. On top of that, the hatch doesn’t count as a door. But anyway, what we have here is a car that splits the difference between the all-out practicality of an SUV with the restrained elegance of a big sedan. And with a bunch of go-fast parts added.
More or less, the 2020 Audi S7 has that same Sportback silhouette as previous models, only this new S7 has unique bumpers, side sills, and quad exhaust outlets. All of this gives the new S7 a more powerful and striking exterior design. Other exterior signatures include the 20-inch, five-twin-spoke wheels with summer performance tires; platinum-colored, double-slat Singleframe grille; aluminum-optic front splitter and side mirror housings; and a rear diffuser inlay in black chrome matte. For the record, I think “aluminum-optic” is Audi-speak for brushed aluminum.
Other styling goodies include Valcona leather seats with diamond stitch patterns. There’s an available dual pane acoustic glass option that gives you a sense of tranquility, according to Audi. That’s their way of saying things will be nice and quiet inside. For additional style points, the available black optic package comes with black exterior mirror housings, and anthracite 21-inch, 5-V-spoke star wheels (with summer performance tires). Sure, that’s all good, but those brushed aluminum mirrors are the cool styling feature that set the Audi S cars apart.
Power & Performance
Speaking of setting this car apart, you want to know what really sets it apart? Power and performance. Bags and bags of both. The 2020 Audi S7 is powered by a twin turbo, 2.9-liter TFSI V6 that cranks out 444 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. of torque. That is a solid 109 horsepower and 74 lb-ft. bump over the normal A7. That translates to a sprint from zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds.

Also new for 2020 is a 48V electric compressor that boosts low-end torque. The standard gearbox is an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic with quattro all-wheel drive, of course. The driveline works with the electric compressor to reduce turbo lag and increase throttle response. In other words, the S7 doesn’t just look menacing, it is menacing.
Related: The Audi RS 6 Avant is one serious wagon!
The S-tuned adaptive air suspension with upgraded brakes allows you to effortlessly switch between more dynamic to more comfortable driving experiences, says Audi. That might be a nice way of saying you can act like a total hoon, then reel it back in when you get to school to pick up the kids. An available S sport package adds all-wheel steering and a quattro differential into the mix to increase maneuverability and enhance the S7’s overall dynamics. The S sport package also adds a sport exhaust and flashy red brake calipers.
Tech & Connectivity Treatments
There is, as you would expect, a ton of standard equipment including Audi’s virtual cockpit; four-zone automatic climate control; a top-view camera system with a Virtual 360 view; and a cranking Bang & Olufsen 3D Premium Sound System. Also included is MMI Navigation with MMI touch response, featuring a 10.1-inch upper and 8.6-inch lower screen. Gone are the rotary dial and conventional buttons, replaced instead with two high-resolution touch displays. Driver assistance features include adaptive cruise assist with traffic jam and turn assist, and Audi side assist with rear cross traffic assist and vehicle exit warning.
2020 Audi S7: Pricing & Availability
The new Audi S7 comes in two trim levels, Premium Plus and Prestige. The Premium Plus will set you back $83,900 while the Prestige will ring out at $89,500. Tack on another $995.00 for destination.

2019/09/09,Bentley Continental GT V8: The Proper Motor Car Lives Again,"It’s a dream car in so many words; the Bentley Continental GT. The grand touring machine embodies the very essence of performance, refinement, and luxury. For all of the options on the market today – sedans, coupes, sports cars, trucks, SUVs, exotics (you name it) – there is really nothing quite like the Continental GT. Perhaps I’m being overly nostalgic, but the Bentley Continental GT brings to mind those old Packards and Rolls-Royces and Cadillacs. In their day, they were Proper Motor Cars. Today, the Bentley Continental GT is such a car.
Bentley Continental GT: The W12 Flyer
The Bentley Continental GT features a 6.0-liter, W12 TSI engine that produces 626 horsepower and 664 lb-ft. of torque. The W12 TSI engine employs both high- and low-pressure direct fuel injection and cylinder deactivation. When at full chat, the Continental GT W12 jets to 60 in 3.6 seconds with a top speed of 207. Fast as that is, it’s nothing compared to the 300 million calculations per second the engine’s internal software management system performs.
The Bentley Continental GT in W12 flavor is a fine filly, however, the newest iteration commands equal attention. Those of us in Detroit relish the letter V and the number 8, and hence, the crew from Crewe delights. The Continental GT V8 is now available, having recently launched on Bentley’s configurator. Did you know the Continental GT has over seven billion different possible configurations? Suffice it to say, between the Rotating Display and neck-warmer; between the sustainable veneers and handcrafted leather, the Bentley Continental GT V8 is as bespoke as they come.
Bigger Power & Better Balance
The Bentley Continental GT V8 gets cooking with 542 horsepower and 568 lb-ft. of torque. The 32-valve, 4.0-liter V8 relies on two turbos at home inside the “V” of the engine. Under heavy throttle, the Continental GT V8 rockets to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds, topping out at 198. The Convertible isn’t far behind, hitting 60 in four seconds flat. During causal cruising, Bentley’s V8 shuts down four cylinders; the change-over happens within 20 milliseconds.
Related: “To build a fast car, a good car, the best in its class.” The story of W.O. Bentley.
Bentley’s engineering team paid close attention to weight distribution across the car in the interest of overall performance. Both the Continental GT V8 and Convertible use hollow anti-roll bars, front and rear, to compliment the optional Dynamic Ride System. The air suspension uses three-chamber air springs for a range between sporty and stiff; to soft and comfortable. From there, Continuous Damping Control constantly adjusts the damping forces relative to road irregularities. The system routinely measures the velocity and distance between the wheels and the body at each corner, and adjusts accordingly. Isn’t math fun?

Powerful Ride & Smooth Inside
If the Bentley Continental GT is to be the ultimate bespoke touring car, then it must be the ultimate bespoke touring car. This surely accounts for the Continental GT V8’s luxurious nature, yet its muscular aura is never far, and perhaps best seen in how Bentley directs their all-wheel drive system. While it can split torque front to rear, it defaults primarily to rear-drive. 100 years ago, Walter Owen (W.O.) Bentley wanted a fast car. Sending the torque to the rear is a good way to make that happen today.
Related: Love Potion #9: An in-depth look at the Continental GT Number 9 Edition.
On the inside, the Bentley Continental GT V8 completes its one-of-a-kind status in flying colors. Among the more notable features is Bentley’s Rotating Display, complete with a revolving 12.3-inch touchscreen and analogue dials. New Crown Cut Walnut adorns the inside, with the option of numerous other wood veneers to suit. V8 variants receive a 650-watt audio system along with eight different roof lining colors to pick from. Safety features include Active Lane Assist, Traffic Jam Assist, and Park Assist.
Bentley Continental GT V8: Ordering & Availability
The Bentley Continental GT V8 is available to order in all markets except EU28, Switzerland, Norway, Ukraine, and Turkey. It will be available to order in those locations in the fourth quarter of this year. Plan for at least $220,000 for the V8; around 232,000 for the W12. We recommend the V8 because it adds muscle car flare to a luxurious and elegant grand tourer. But the W12 is pretty sweet too. Either way, the Bentley Continental GT is arguably among the last of the Proper Motor Cars; if not the only Proper Motor Car.

2019/09/06,"2020 Porsche Taycan: Inside The Four-Door, Fully-Electric 911","The 2020 Taycan is the first-ever electric vehicle from Porsche.
It has dual-electric motors and an 800-volt electrical architecture.
Porsche will offer the Taycan in two trims with different power outputs.
Folks, the 2020 Porsche Taycan is finally here. The Taycan is a number of firsts for Porsche. It’s the first-ever electric vehicle from the Stuttgart-based automaker, and it’s the first EV to come with an 800-volt architecture. It’s also notable for the clever two-speed transmission, which we will discuss in a moment. The Taycan is also the record-holder as the fastest four-door, all-electric sports car around the Nürburgring Nordschleife.
It did it in seven minutes and 42 seconds.
But alas! Elon Musk announced on Twitter the Tesla Model S will make an appearance at the Nürburgring next week, which is right smack in the middle of the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show – an international car fest dominated by popular German brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and yes, Porsche. Will the Tesla Model S beat the Taycan’s record, or will the Porsche finally lay claim to the mythical title of Tesla killer?
For now, let’s take a closer look at the 2020 Porsche Taycan, which is essentially a four-door electric 911.
Proprietary 800-Volt Architecture
I’m not big on electric jargon, nor am I pretending to know a lot about the inner workings of an EV. But I know the Taycan’s 800-volt architecture is unprecedented. It’s also a dominating factor for the Taycan, responsible for the longer range, higher efficiency, and overall performance. You may know the Taycan managed to sprint from zero to 200 mph repetitively? It did so without any degradation from the electric motors and battery pack, and the 800-volt architecture has a lot to do with that.
You see, other electric cars are running less than half the voltage – in particular, the 375-volt system in the Tesla Model S. In the Taycan, a higher voltage means lower current, which also equates to less heat generated by the motors and battery. It also means less weight since the vehicle comes with lighter and thinner wires that take up less space.
And since the whole electrical system produces less heat, it allows the motors and battery to deliver consistent power outputs without losing a beat. The 800-volt system also means faster charging times without overheating the 93.4 kWh battery pack. In fact, it only takes around 22 minutes to charge the battery to 80 percent using a 270 kW DC fast charger. Meanwhile, it takes 6 to 8 hours to fully charge using the standard 11 kW charger.
Ingenious Two-Speed Automatic Transmission
This feature is one of the most unique about the 2020 Porsche Taycan. Frankly, we’re surprised Tesla didn’t come out with this first, and we’re constantly blabbering on why electric vehicles only come with a single-speed transmission. It only makes sense to have more than a single gear in a torquey EV, and Porsche seems to know this all too well.
The two-speed gearbox is specifically-developed by Porsche for the Taycan EV. The entire unit is mounted on the rear axle. With two electric motors in the front and rear, the Taycan is an all-wheel drive electric sports car, but it’s not a full-time system constantly spinning all four wheels. When you’re not pushing it to the limit, the Taycan is using second gear with power coming exclusively from the front wheels.
However, in Sport or Sport Plus mode, first gear is engaged during acceleration to deliver maximum thrills with all four wheels burning the tarmac. First gear remains until 50 mph and switches to a taller second gear to maximize the range and top speed.
Porsche Taycan Styling: 911 Meets Panamera
And then we get to what is conceivably the most important factor of all: the way it looks. The Taycan pretty much resembles the 911, especially when viewed from the front. But as you gaze towards the sides and rear, it borrows certain styling cues from the four-door Panamera. Then again, the Taycan sits lower to the ground and is shorter than the Panamera. Think of it as a stretched 911 with four doors and you won’t be far off.
Truthfully, we weren’t blown away by the Porsche Taycan’s styling. I don’t know about the rest of the team here at Automoblog, but I personally think the Taycan is a bit underwhelming in terms of style points. Maybe it’s because I’m all too familiar with the Mission E concept car, or maybe I’m expecting the Taycan to differ greatly from the concept first seen at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The interior is a different story altogether. You can get five touchscreens in a full-spec Taycan, and you also get the 911’s steering wheel as an added bonus. You sit low in the Taycan like in the 911, which contributes greatly to the vehicle’s sporting appeal.
Porsche Taycan Production Specs
Porsche is peddling the Taycan in Turbo and Turbo S trim. No, there are no actual turbos in the Taycan, but who are we to judge? Both cars have two electric motors. The Taycan Turbo has a maximum output of 670 horsepower and 626 lb-ft. of torque. The Turbo has a range between 237 and 280 miles. Meanwhile, the Turbo S is good for 750 horsepower and 774 lb-ft. of torque. The Turbo S achieves 241 to 256 miles of range. Both have a top speed of 161 mph, and both have the 800-volt architecture and rear-mounted, two-speed transmission.

As you can see, even the base Taycan is powerful enough to outrun most sports cars. The Taycan Turbo rushes from zero to 60 mph in three seconds while the Turbo S is faster yet at 2.6 seconds. For all these impressive numbers, we can’t help but wonder if all this is enough to outpace the Tesla Model S Performance version. The Tesla scampers to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds and has a range of 345 miles.
2020 Porsche Taycan: Pricing & Availability
Unfortunately, all the marvelous features in the Porsche Taycan won’t come cheap. The Taycan Turbo starts at $150,900 while the Turbo S comes in at $185,000. While the Turbo S undercuts the Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid, Tesla’s Model S Performance is less than $100,000 and is presumably faster and more “ludicrous” in the real world.
However, the Model S is a proper sport-luxury touring car, while Porsche is designating the Taycan as a true four-door electric sports car. We’ll find out soon enough which is which.

2019/09/06,BMW i8 Ultimate Sophisto & i3s Edition RoadStyle: A Quick Look,"Two new special editions are available for the BMW i8 and i3.
Pricing information is forthcoming for the limited-edition models. 
After the special editions arrive, BMW is putting the i8 into retirement.
The BMW i lineup now has two new special editions, although how long they stick around is another thing entirely. The i line is BMW’s tag team of electric and PHEV vehicles, the i3 and i8. Up first is the i3s Edition RoadStyle, a cool name for a gnarly-looking vehicle BMW dubs as the quickest and sportiest i3 yet. Then the i8 Ultimate Sophisto Edition, which receives an E-Copper trim plus a number of upscale interior details. Contrasting the i3 mightily in terms of appearance, fans may recall the BMW i8 as Ethan Hunt’s ride in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.
The only impossible thing about these two, however, might simply be getting your hands on one. The i3s Edition RoadStyle is limited to only 900 while the allocation for the i8 Ultimate Sophisto Edition is a mere 200. What’s more, those 200 are it. After that, the i8 is going into retirement. BMW says it’s the “final chapter” in the i8’s story.
BMW i8 Ultimate Sophisto Edition
Indeed it may not get anymore special than this unique send-off. Available in both coupe and convertible, this rare BMW i8 sports a Sophisto Grey metallic paint. E-Copper accents decorate the 20-inch alloy wheels, kidney grille, and side skirts. High-gloss black accents run through the brake calipers with blue accents and BMW i badging. Special door sill plates mark the car’s number accordingly – i.e. “1 of 200” and so on. Tech and connectivity treatments include a heads-up display, navigation, Apple CarPlay, and a Harman-Kardon audio system.
The all-wheel drive i8 Ultimate Sophisto Edition produces a combined 369 horsepower and 420 lb-ft. of torque. Convertible versions hit 60 in 4.4 seconds while the coupe does the job in 4.2 seconds. Fuel economy is a healthy 69 MPGe.
BMW i3s Edition RoadStyle
The i3s Edition RoadStyle comes to the party with Fluid Black exterior paint and E-Copper touches for the kidney grille inlays, front bumper air deflectors, and side skirts. The RoadStyle is all about style on the road with those 20-inch, Jet Black, double-spoke alloy wheels. Dalbergia Brown leather and Dark Oak wood trim dominate the inside; the headrests even receive “Edition RoadStyle” embroidery. The i3s applies a number of sustainable features throughout the cabin, including recycled plastics, fibers, and other raw materials. BMW says over 80 percent of the visible surfaces inside are made from recycled or renewable sources.
Related: A new breed: On the road with the luxurious BMW M850i xDrive Convertible. 
The all-electric i3s is powered by an eDrive motor producing 181 horsepower (4,100 rpm) and 199 lb-ft. of torque from zero rpm. A 120 Ah / 42.2 kWh battery allows for a range of up to 153 miles. 60 mph comes up in 6.8 seconds, thanks to the vehicle’s carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell. The carbon fiber treatments help keep the weight down; the i3s clocks in at just 3,040 lbs.

BMW says production of both will begin later this year. Pricing will be announced closer to the on-sale date. Our gut says if you are truly complicating one of these, visit a BMW dealership and try placing an order. It doesn’t seem likely these will end up on too many BMW lots given the limited numbers.

Jeep enthusiasts will appreciate the historical and vintage appeal of the new models. 
There’s black and tan beer; black and tan coffee and now, a black & tan Jeep! Fans and enthusiasts of the storied brand will be glad to know the Jeep Wrangler Willys and Black & Tan editions are coming down the pipe. Based on the Wrangler Sport S, the Willys and Black & Tan are meant to get Jeep fans excited about the new lineup.
“Special editions are a perfect way for Jeep to connect with customers and feed their ideas and passion into the brand and its vehicles,” explained Jim Morrison, Head of Jeep Brand – North America. “Wrangler Willys harkens back to the original Jeep while Wrangler Black & Tan offers a unique look with a tan top.”
Jeep Wrangler Willys
The Wrangler Willys is ready for Moab with a limited-slip rear differential; Rubicon rock rails and shocks; heavy-duty brakes, and 32-inch Firestone mud terrain tires. The all-terrain party continues with a two-speed transfer case with a 2.72:1 low-range gear ratio, and Jeep’s Command-Trac 4×4 system (part-time).

Your choice of 10 colors: Black, Granite Crystal, Sting Gray, Billet, Ocean Blue, Firecracker Red, Punk’n, Hellayella, Mojito! and White. Personally, we say go for the Punk’n color. Love them bright orange Jeeps! Also, this is the first time a Willys edition is available on the newest-generation Jeep Wrangler (JL).

Like the Willys, the Black & Tan is a first for the new Wrangler line. The Black & Tan is available in any and all Jeep exterior colors. Punk’n anyone?
About The New Jeep Wrangler
The 2019 Jeep Wrangler employs a body-on-frame design; five-link front and rear suspension; solid axles; and electronic lockers. The hollow track and stabilizer bars; aluminum engine mounts and steering gear; and a revised master cylinder help cut weight. Powertrain options include a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 with engine stop-start (ESS); 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 with mild-hybrid e-Torque technology; a 2.0-liter turbo inline four-cylinder with ESS; and a 2.0-liter turbo inline four-cylinder with mild-hybrid e-Torque technology. Next year, Jeep Wrangler 4-door buyers can opt for the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel.

The grille was positioned for better aerodynamic performance as was the windshield. A four bolt design at the top of the windshield’s frame allows it to fold down easily; a new header bar now connects the A-pillars and stays put even with the windshield down. On the inside, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto join a host of other infotainment and navigation features.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Jeep Wrangler Willys and Black & Tan editions are available to order now. Wrangler Willys has an MSRP of $33,740 for the two-door model; $37,240 for the four-door. The Black & Tan has an MSRP of $32,940 for the two-door model; $36,440 for the four-door. In our opinion, the starting MSRP is pretty reasonable for these two vehicles which look like a blast to drive.
“We are proud that both new models will add to the wide appeal Jeep Wrangler already offers,” Morrison said.

2019/08/30,2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe: Anything But Conventional,"The 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe is set to arrive in mid-2020.
The powertrain includes a special EQ Boost electric auxiliary compressor. 
It has a shorter wheelbase than a conventional GLE SUV with sportier handling.
Have you seen Mercedes-Benz’s SUV offerings lately? If you’re familiar with the German automaker’s growing lineup, the GLE coupe has always been offered in AMG trim. Not that we’re complaining, but I personally think it has something to do with America’s desire for large, fast, and ultimately stylish gas-guzzlers. And for the average American who’s looking for a large, fast, and stylish gas-guzzling SUV, allow me to introduce the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe.
This SUV is meant for folks who think the regular GLE is too boxy and conventional for the modern world.
Before you say the AMG GLE 53 Coupe is simply a restyled GLE SUV with a sexier sloping roofline, Mercedes-AMG is on a mission to put all doubts to rest. The new offering here from Affalterbach is more than a pretty face and it’s anything but ordinary.
Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe: Same Face, Different Body
It’s hard to discern the changes at first glance. The task is more difficult if you’re not totally familiar with the outgoing AMG GLE. While the new model is wearing the same hood, lower bumper, headlights, and taillights as the regular GLE, it’s the changes underneath that matter most.
For starters, Mercedes-AMG reduced the wheelbase of the GLE 53 Coupe by 2.4 inches. This gives the vehicle a sportier feel while also slightly improving the rather bulbous rear design. The styling is still a love-it or hate-it affair, but Mercedes finally succeeded in making the GLE Coupe look cleaner and saner than the previous model. Think of it this way: if you’re relatively young and have two kids, the GLE Coupe is more appealing as long as you can afford it.
Now that I mention it, it’s important to point out the GLE Coupe (albeit in AMG trim) is approximately $15,000 dearer than a base model GLE. You’ll have to be relatively young (or young at heart), affluent, and have two kids to even consider the GLE Coupe.
Distinctive AMG Styling
The 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe is clearly a member of the AMG family with that wide and gaping, AMG-specific Panamericana grille design. The twin power domes on the hood are hinting at the potent engine underneath while the slim headlights and A-wing in the front bumper enhance the sporting intent of the vehicle.

Speaking of the front bumper, it receives AMG-specific features like those sporty outer air inlets, twin side louvers, and that front splitter in a silver chrome finish. The vehicle also receives AMG side skirts and a subtle trunk lid spoiler. The new rear bumper houses a diffuser and an AMG exhaust system with twin chrome tailpipes.
Related: Small enough for families of seven. Meet the Mercedes-Benz GLB 250.
Turbocharged Motor With EQ Boost Technology
Did I fail to mention the AMG GLE 53 is an electrified SUV? It has a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six and an EQ Boost electric auxiliary compressor. If all this sounds familiar, it’s the same motor and EQ Boost compressor in the 2019 Mercedes-AMG E 53 Sedan. Both vehicles produce 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft. of torque. The EQ Boost starter generator powers the 48-volt on-board electrical system while providing an additional 21 horsepower and 184 lb-ft. of torque when it matters most.
With this setup, the new Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe rushes from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, with a top speed of 155 mph. It outruns the outgoing AMG GLE 43 but falls short when accosted by the AMG GLE 63 S with its 577 horsepower, twin-turbo V8 motor. But still, the AMG GLE 53 is pretty quick for a family SUV.
Shifting duties are courtesy of the AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT nine-speed automatic; driving all four wheels via a fully-variable 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive system. The latter continuously monitors and calculates the torque distribution between the front and rear axle to enhance traction and lateral dynamics. Suffice it to say, this SUV is meant to be driven hard.
AMG Dynamic Select Drive Programs
The GLE Coupe is still an SUV with all-wheel drive. It’s only natural to expect some mild to moderate off-road capabilities despite the sporting apprehensions. In order to address this fact, the AMG Dynamic Select system offers seven drive programs. Besides the usual Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+, and Individual modes, it also has Trail and Sand modes if you happen to find yourself off-road. Trail mode is for driving over soft, muddy, or slippery terrain. Sand mode offers the best possible grip and steering control over loose surfaces like sand dunes and slopes.
The standard AMG Ride Control (air suspension) with continuously-adjustable damping also reacts, depending on the chosen drive mode. Damping changes from soft to firm as you shuttle between Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ along with Trail and Sand. It also raises or lowers the GLE 53 Coupe accordingly. In fact, the air suspension can raise the vehicle by up to 2.2 inches even when moving at 43 mph. Meanwhile, it can also lower everything by 0.6 inches at speeds up to 75 mph.

Luxurious & Tech-Filled Interior
We’re still talking about a proper Mercedes here. Hence, it’s only fitting for the new AMG GLE 53 to have a luxurious and high-tech interior. You’ll find a lot of red elements in the cabin to distinguish the vehicle from a conventional Mercedes. The AMG sports seats are wrapped in black DINAMICA microfiber while genuine cowhide remains an option.
The newest Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 also comes with the MBUX infotainment system. Mercedes’ trademark widescreen cockpit combines a digital instrument cluster and a touchscreen display with voice control. The multi-function AMG performance steering wheel comes with aluminum shift paddles and intuitive touch controls to operate the MBUX system. The tiller feels wonderful to touch courtesy of premium black leather and red contrast stitching. There’s also a red 12 o’clock marking front and center.
Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe: Pricing & Availability
Mercedes-AMG will debut the 2021 GLE 53 Coupe at the Frankfurt Motor Show, which begins on Thursday, September 12th. Expect it at dealerships by the middle of next year. Complete pricing and other specs are forthcoming.

2019/08/30,2020 Porsche Macan Turbo: New Features & Updates All Around,"The 2020 Porsche Macan Turbo is heading to dealerships with a number of updates.
Zero to 60 times improve with the 2.9-liter turbo engine and seven-speed transmission.
Connectivity options are nearly endless for the new Macan Turbo, due out later this year.
The 2020 Porsche Macan Turbo is here with a revised powertrain and chassis, plus improvements in acceleration and braking over last year. Judging by the number of these things I see around, I’d bet we’ll notice even more of them now. Just a few days ago, I walked by a Porsche Macan parked next to a new Subaru Forester. I was surprised to find they were, more or less, the same size. I always perceived Macans as being a lot bigger than they are.
Honestly, I can see why Porsche is selling these guys by the boatload. Upper-end city dwellers must be eating these things up. What’s not to like from their perspective? It’s a nicely-styled SUV/crossover. It has lots of practicality and room for a normal-sized family. And it’s a Porsche.
2020 Porsche Macan Turbo: Power & Performance
The 2020 Macan is powered by a 2.9-liter, twin-turbo V6 that puts out 434 horsepower and 405 lb-ft. of torque. That will give you a zero to 60 mph sprint of 4.3 seconds, or 4.1 seconds with the optional Sport Chrono package. The acceleration time is a 0.3-second improvement versus the 2019 model, with or without the Sport Chrono package. Top speed is now up to 167, a bump of three mph. Just like other Macans, power is sent to all four wheels via a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission and Porsche’s Traction Management system.
Braking & Suspension Components
Porsche’s Surface Coated Brakes now stop you quicker and the white calipers look nice too. These are the same stoppers from the third-generation Cayenne models by the way. The rotors are coated in an ultra-hard layer of tungsten carbide to reduce brake dust and provide sharper response. Once they’re broken in, the rotors take on a mirror-like finish, according to Porsche. A Sport Exhaust system is now on the list of standard performance equipment; as are the 20-inch Macan Turbo wheels.
The standard dampers (Porsche Active Suspension Management) include an optional, height-adjustable air suspension. The system consists of new shock absorber hydraulics and enhanced rolling pistons. Other available options include Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus and the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake system.

Styling & Design
The exterior gets a freshening up with a Macan-specific front fascia and three large air intakes. Sportier side skirts and exterior mirrors (body color) help differentiate the Macan Turbo. There are also dual-strip LED fog lights above the front air intakes, complimenting the LED headlights and Porsche’s Dynamic Light System.

There’s an Alcantara roof liner; 18-way Adaptive Sport Seats with Memory Package; and a 665-watt, 14-speaker Bose Surround Sound system. The 10.9-inch HD touchscreen offers the latest connectivity in the form of Porsche Communication Management with Porsche Connect Plus; an LTE telephone module; integrated SIM card and a slot for an external SIM card; a Wi-Fi hotspot; and a one-year subscription to numerous Porsche Connect services, including navigation. The list of connectivity features is about endless for the 2020 Porsche Macan Turbo.
Lastly, the Multifunction GT Sport steering wheel is an option along with Qi inductive charging.
2020 Porsche Macan Turbo: Pricing & Availability
The starting price is a rather Porsche-like $83,600, plus $1,350 for destination. The 2020 Porsche Macan should be at your local dealer near the end of this year.

2019/08/29,2020 Honda Civic Si: Worthy Type R Alternative Offers More Bang for the Buck,"2020 Honda Civic Si debuts with new styling and tech updates.
The only factory option for the new Civic Si are the $200 summer tires.
Arriving in September, the Civic Si will also have a shorter final gear ratio.
Back in the not so distant past, the Civic Si was regarded as the poor man’s Type R. But with the refreshed 2020 Honda Civic Si, I don’t think that’s true anymore. In fact, I think the Si is better than the Type R, and I’ll explain more in a minute. For now, I sincerely think the Si model is the best Civic in the lineup. It’s not because it has a turbocharged four-banger, nor a slick-shifting six-speed manual box. It also doesn’t have to do with the price either (which again, we’ll dig deeper in a bit).
It’s because the new Civic Si pretty much reminds me of Honda’s glory days in the early to late 90s.
2020 Honda Civic Si: The Honda Resurgence
If you’re old enough to remember, Honda was the you know what back then; they still are now, but only after waking up from a 15-year hiatus. All those screaming B16, B18, and F20C motors are permanently engraved in my consciousness. Mind you, I’m not the biggest Honda fan, but I surely appreciate the engineering and reliability of those marvelous high-revving Honda engines.
For me, the last hot Civic is the sixth-generation EK model. After that, everything went tepid. When the tenth-gen Civic arrived in 2016, it wasn’t a coincidence the second-gen Acura NSX was introduced in the same year. Honda is back, and the Civic is better than ever! So, when Honda gave the current Civic some mild updates for 2019, we were pining for the Si to get those updates too. Apparently, Honda did this without significantly hiking up the price.
Aggressive Exterior Styling
Want to know why the 2020 Honda Civic Si is making me feel like it’s college all over again, and why I prefer this wholeheartedly over the Type R? It’s the fact Honda is offering the Civic Si in two-door coupe and sedan body styles. I personally like the Si coupe, but the sedan is not too shabby either. In terms of looks, there’s nothing wrong with the base Civic sedan. However, if you think its face is like that of a Stormtrooper, you’re not alone.
Alas! The new Civic Si still looks like a Stormtrooper, but it now has a more athletic vibe. The car receives new lower bumper fog light housings with a body-color crossbar; new multi-element LED headlights and a new rear bumper. Civic Si models also receive a fixed rear wing (which is thankfully subtle!) and matte-black 18-inch wheels. All-season tires are standard, but summer tires are a $200 factory option.

Red Accents & Physical Buttons
The 2020 Honda Civic Si receives a ton of red accents in the cabin. You also get new sports seats with red Si badges and an updated audio system with physical buttons and – finally – an actual volume knob. The previous touch-sensitive scroll bar was a pain in the butt, so good job again, Honda! You still get Bluetooth, a 450-watt premium audio system with 10 speakers, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in case you’re wondering.
Turbocharged Power & Manual Transmission
Want more proof the Civic Si is for purists? It’s only available with a six-speed manual gearbox, and it’s a brilliant one at that. Honda knows how to make manual transmissions feel right on the money, and the Civic Si is no exception.
That delectable manual box is mated to a familiar 1.5-liter, direct-injected and turbocharged inline four-cylinder. It produces a healthy 205 horsepower. More importantly, it churns out 192 lb-ft. of torque (2,100 to 5,000 rpm). And while Honda has yet to specify the exact math, it wouldn’t be hard to push the Civic Si from zero to 60 below 6.5 seconds given the right circumstances.
The new Civic Si also receives a six percent shorter final drive ratio. This is the only mechanical upgrade in the new Si, but it’s a significant one. It still comes with a standard helical limited-slip differential, but a shorter final drive ratio means quicker acceleration and more immediate throttle response. In short, it makes the car feel quicker on its toes and more fun to drive.
Standard Honda Sensing & LaneWatch
The 2020 Honda Civic Si also benefits from a host of new age safety and driver-assistance features. Standard in the new Civic Si is Honda Sensing which includes adaptive cruise control, collision mitigating braking, forward collision warning, lane keeping assist, lane departure warning, and road departure mitigation.
The new Civic Si also gets Honda’s exclusive LaneWatch side-view camera system. It’s easy enough to understand without being a rocket scientist. The system activates the camera in each of the side mirrors as you engage the turn signals. The camera feed is projected on the infotainment screen. It essentially eliminates blind spots to avoid sudden accidents.
2020 Honda Civic Si: Pricing & Availability
The best part is the $25,000 base price, which is only $700 more than the previous model. This includes the two-mode adaptive suspension, a leather-wrapped tiller, and rearview camera all standard. The 2020 Honda Civic Si looks better than the Type R, and is presumably more comfortable and easier to drive. The new Si is arguably more usable for everyday driving, as it offers 12.1 and 15.1 cubic feet of cargo space in the coupe and sedan, respectively. Oh, and it doesn’t cost $37,000.

2019/08/27,2020 GMC Lineup: A Quick Look At The Changes & New Features,"The 2020 GMC lineup receives a number of new tech updates. 
Both Sierra and Sierra HD models now have 10-speed transmissions.
The AT4, an aggressive 4×4 trim, is available on more GMC models for 2020.   
Listen up all you working Joes and Josephines! The details, changes, and new features for the 2020 GMC lineup have been announced. So, if you work with your hands for a living, have to haul a lot of people and/or things, but want a little extra luxury while doing so, you might want to consider what GMC is up to for 2020.
For starters, GMC has re-done the entire line with a styling update while adding new safety and tech features. The first-ever AT4 Acadia is on offer, a more aggressive off-road version of the already popular SUV. The Acadia now joins the Sierra 1500 and Sierra HD as the newest member of the AT4 sub-brand.
Terrain
We’ll start with a look at the 2020 Terrain. The smaller SUV is updated for 2020 with GMC Pro Safety, now standard across all trim levels. The expanded safety package includes Automatic Emergency Braking; Forward Collision Alert; Lane Keep Assistance with Lane Departure Warning; Following Distance Indicator; Front Pedestrian Braking; and IntelliBeam Headlamps.
There is a bunch of optional safety stuff, like the Driver Alert Package for example. That includes Adaptive Cruise Control; Lane Change Alert; Side Blind Zone Alert; Rear Cross Traffic Alert; Rear Park Assist and Safety Alert Seat.
Terrain Denali & Elevation Edition
For 2020, Denali models will add Front Park Assist in addition to Rear Park Assist. The new Denali Premium Package combines the Advanced Safety Package and Comfort Package with Adaptive Cruise Control. Ventilated driver and front passenger seats, and heated rear seats are available. The 2020 Terrain Denali is further set apart by a premium suspension package with new internal valves and spring isolators. GMC says this makes for a more refined ride by further reducing road noise.
There is also the popular Terrain Black Edition, now called the Terrain Elevation Edition. This version gets you that popular blacked-out look for the wheels and badges and trim bits every automaker seems to be doing these days. This swanky version is offered in Summit White, Graphite Gray Metallic or Ebony Twilight Metallic.
Acadia
The GMC Acadia receives exterior design updates including a new grille; new front and rear facias; standard LED lighting and signature GMC C-shape lighting. That first-ever Acadia AT4 I mentioned at the beginning has even more aggressive exterior styling along with darkened finishes. Lane Change Alert with Side Blind Zone Alert, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, and Rear Park Assist are now standard on all trims.

There’s a new nine-speed automatic transmission standard for the 2.0L, 2.5L, and 3.6L engines. A new 2.0L turbo engine is now standard for SLT and Denali models. The 2.0L turbo (late availability GMC says) produces a GMC-estimated 230 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. Ride and handling are beefed-up courtesy of new suspension refinements, although GMC didn’t elaborate beyond that. The interior also gets some tweaks, a new heads-up display and infotainment system being among the highlights.
Sierra
The 3.0L Duramax turbo-diesel mill is now on offer for the Sierra 1500, which is probably the biggest news. The inline-six diesel engine, paired with a 10-speed automatic, produces 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of torque. Speaking of that 10-speed automatic, it’s now available for the SLT, AT4, and 4×4 Denali models with the 5.3L V8. The CarbonPro Edition – which replaces the bed’s inner steel panels and floor with a lighter carbon fiber composite – is now available for the AT4 and Denali.
Other upgrades for 2020 include a ProGrade Trailering System featuring 15 total available camera views, including a trippy yet handy “transparent trailer view.” There’s also the Adaptive Cruise Control – Camera feature added for 2020. The system has a single, high-mounted camera behind the rearview mirror that can bring the Sierra to a complete stop.
Sierra HD
This brings us to the new Sierra Heavy Duty. As the name implies, it will give you greater towing capability with technologies designed to provide you with added confidence while doing so. Right up front, it’s worth noting this big guy can haul 35,500 lbs. down the road when properly configured. (3500 Duramax Regular Cab, long box, two-wheel drive). Allison’s first-ever 10-speed automatic is now paired to the Sierra HD’s 6.6L Duramax diesel.
Sierra HD Towing Tech
Tech features include an available Enhanced ProGrade Trailering system with 15 camera views, including that transparent trailer view so you can “see through” your trailer. The iN-Command Control System by ASA Electronics lets you monitor and control various functions on compatible trailers through the myGMC mobile app. And for a first in the segment, a whopping 15-inch-diagonal heads-up display. It dishes up useful information like speed and navigation; there is even an inclinometer which lets drivers know a given road’s grade.
Now for 2020, the Sierra AT4 HD is available for Crew Cab configurations, in both a 2500 and 3500 single rear-wheel setup. The six-function MultiPro tailgate is available on all trims but standard on SLT, AT4, and Denali.
Canyon
The 2020 GMC Canyon now has a standard Tire Fill Alert. The feature gives you an audible and visual indication when tire pressure increases via filling. The Canyon also has a newly-available remote locking tailgate. The All Terrain trim for the Canyon adds a Driver Alert package, plus Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning. Carbon Black Metallic is also a new color for 2020.

2019/08/27,2020 VW Lineup: A Quick Look At The Changes & New Features,"The 2020 VW lineup receives a host of new tech and safety updates. 
Wireless charging and on-board Wi-Fi is now available on most models. 
The VW Golf remains our top choice in terms of affordability and efficiency. 
For automakers, the 2020 model year is right around the corner. Volkswagen, being one of the largest car manufacturers on the planet, has big plans on how the company will move forward. The quick sketch of what will apply to the 2020 VW lineup breaks down like this. Most vehicles receive the next-gen version of Car-Net and on-board Wi-Fi standard. Wireless charging is available and nearly all 2020 models will include Front Assist, Blind Spot Monitor, Forward Collision Warning, and Rear Traffic Alert standard.
VW also points out how they have simplified the trim levels to “put an emphasis on value.” Read that as “we need to cut costs.” Here’s what we can look forward to, vehicle by vehicle for VW for 2020.
Atlas
VW’s big SUV crossover will come in seven trim levels: S, SE, SE w/Technology, SE w/ Technology R-Line, SEL, SEL R-Line, and SEL Premium. All Atlas models are equipped with the new Car-Net telematics system and have Wi-Fi capability. SE w/ Technology R-Line trims offer standard front and rear Park Distance Control and an Easy Open liftgate feature.
SE w/Technology models and above will get 20-inch aluminum-alloy wheels standard, while the SEL Premium rides on 21-inch wheels.
Arteon
VW’s latest stab at a big luxo-sedan comes in four trims for 2020: SE, SEL, SEL R-Line, and SEL Premium R-Line. The Arteon also gets the new Car-Net telematics system along with in-car Wi-Fi. SEL models get 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels while SEL Premium models have 20-inch wheels and R-Line content.
Golf
The evergreen VW Golf will be available in one well-equipped trim level for 2020: the Value Edition. Don’t let the name fool you; the Value Edition is anything but a stripped-down model. Such niceties include the Car-Net telematics system and Wi-Fi capability. Other upscale features include push-button start, leatherette seating surfaces, heated front seats, a panoramic tilt-and-slide sunroof, and heated washer nozzles. The latest Golf rides on standard 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.
The e-Golf, VW’s ongoing foray into the growing EV market, comes in two trims for 2020: SE and SEL Premium. The Driver Assistance Package is now standard for both, and includes Front Assist, Blind Spot Monitor, Rear Traffic Alert, and Adaptive Cruise Control. VW says the e-Golf will only be available in certain states.

Golf GTI
The Golf GTI (the one us gearheads like most) comes in two trims: S and SE. Front Assist, Blind Spot Monitor, and Rear Traffic Alert are now standard, plus in-car Wi-Fi and the next gen Car-Net infotainment system. An available Autobahn Package is there for the SE model and gets you a slew of upscale features: a Discover Media infotainment system with nav; automatic dual-zone climate control; Fender Premium Audio system; Adaptive Cruise Control; Lane Assist, and Light Assist.
Jetta
The Jetta (that’s a Golf with a trunk) comes in five trims for 2020: S, SE, R-Line, SEL, and SEL Premium. Naturally, every Jetta is equipped with the Car-Net telematics system and on-board Wi-Fi. SEL and SEL Premium trims offer wireless charging as standard. SE and SE R-Line get the Cold Weather Package, which is a suite of winter goodies. The package gives you three heated items – steering wheel, rear seats, and washer nozzles – along with a remote start. Both SEL and SEL Premium now sport standard 17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels.
The Jetta GLI (it’s like a Golf GTI with a trunk) comes in two trim levels: S and Autobahn. The Autobahn model has wireless charging and the DCC adaptive damping system for 2020. Car-Net telematics and Wi-Fi capability? Check and check.
Passat
For 2020, the VW Passat is redesigned and has four trim levels: S, SE, R-Line, and SEL. The redesign gives it a more coupe-like profile and actually makes the humble Passat look a bit bolder than in previous years. Upgrades to the 2.0-liter turbo TSI engine include a new torque converter and new software for a boost in torque output to 207 lb-ft. On the inside, the infotainment system is upgraded with a new glass-covered touchscreen.
Tiguan
This compact SUV is offered in five trims: S, SE, SE R-Line Black, SEL, and SEL Premium R-Line. Front Assist, Side Assist, and Rear Traffic Alert are standard on all models for 2020. On top of these upgrades, wireless charging is available starting on the SE trim level. The Tiguan SE R-Line Black trim, which is new for 2020, features 20-inch black aluminum-alloy wheels; black-accented R-Line bumpers and badging; foglights; a panoramic sunroof; front and rear Park Distance Control; and a black headliner for the interior.
The SEL model adds more upscale features like a heated steering wheel, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and rain-sensing wipers. The SEL Premium R-Line gets you all of the R-Line’s content, plus 20-inch wheels. Like the others in the 2020 VW lineup, the Tiguan will have the next-gen version of Car-Net and Wi-Fi standard.

2019/08/23,2020 Chevy Bolt: Change In The Interest of Range,"The 2020 Chevy Bolt undergoes a few critical changes and tweaks for the new model year. 
Said changes help the new Bolt return an EPA-estimated 259 miles of range on a full charge.
Change in the interest of range: that’s the story behind the 2020 Chevy Bolt EV due later this year. Chevy recently announced EPA ratings for the new Bolt, a praiseworthy 259 miles of range on a single charge. The figure, a 21-mile increase versus the current Bolt, addresses the nagging concern of range anxiety potential buyers have when considering an EV. According to AAA, 20 percent – or close to 50 million Americans are looking to buy an electric vehicle as their next car. The figure represents a 15 percent jump from 2017.
“At Chevrolet we’re constantly listening to customer feedback and we heard the desire for more range,” explained Tim Grewe, director of Global Battery Cell Engineering and Strategy. “The team worked diligently to find ways to improve battery energy, giving customers the confidence to go more than the extra mile.”
2020 Chevy Bolt: Cell Chemistry Changes
The battery engineering team spent the bulk of their time improving the energy of the cell electrodes. While it sounds like a Herculean task, Chevy says it was more about little tweaks versus moving mountains. The automaker describes these changes to the Bolt’s cell chemistry as small but impactful. While they don’t elaborate beyond that, Chevy says packaging is unaffected by the changes. Even though range increases, the battery’s physical size remains the same as does its position within the vehicle’s architecture.
The lithium-ion battery contains 288 cells with an output of 66 kWh. The battery pack itself is 430 lbs., about 12 percent of the 2020 Chevy Bolt’s curb weight (3,563 lbs.). With a DC fast-charger, the 2020 Chevy Bolt will return up to 90 miles in 30 minutes. The 240 volt charger is the overnight option, juicing the new Bolt to 100 percent in about 10 hours. Chevy’s recent partnership with Qmerit is meant to help owners find quotes from certified electricians to install at-home charging equipment.
Working in concert with the battery is the permanent magnetic drive motor. All said and done, the 2020 Chevy Bolt produces 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft. of torque through a final drive ratio of 7.05:1.
Essential Foundations
The 2020 Chevy Bolt rides on an independent (MacPherson) strut-type suspension with a solid stabilizer bar up front, while a torsion beam with coil springs supports the rear. The Bolt’s electric steering nets a turning circle of 35 feet, good for busy parking lots and smaller city streets. The four-wheel disc ABS system is electro-hydraulic and partially regenerative, complete with 11-inch vented rotors at the front and 10-inch solid rotors at the rear. Michelin Energy Saver all-season tires are the icing on the cake for the 17-inch wheels.

How Big Is The 2020 Chevy Bolt?
In terms of size: the 2020 Chevy Bolt has a 102.4-inch wheelbase with an overall length of 164 inches. Width is 69.5 inches; height is 62.8 inches. Cargo volume behind the second row is 16.9 cubic feet; total cargo volume is 56.6 cubic feet. Headroom up front is 39.7 inches and 37.9 inches in the back. By contrast, legroom up front is 41.6 inches and 36.5 inches in the back.
Pricing & Availability
Expect the new Bolt at dealerships later this year with a starting MSRP of $37,495. Two new exterior colors, Cayenne Orange Metallic and Oasis Blue, are on offer. The 2020 Bolt includes an Energy Assist feature through the myChevrolet mobile app. This helps drivers search for charging stations, plan a trip with multiple waypoints, and monitor their route among other things.

2019/08/22,Audi RS 6 Avant: Powerful Wagon On Its Way To The USA,"The forthcoming RS 6 Avant is the next model in the Audi Sport lineup.
A turbo engine and an adaptable suspension are among the performance features.
Audi says the wagon delivers exhilarating driving dynamics and everyday functionality.
Wagon fans who fancy under-the-hood muscle have reason to celebrate. The Audi RS 6 Avant is coming to the United States, according to the automaker. Audi is promising the stars but hoping to deliver the galaxy with the high-performance wagon, which represents the latest chapter for the Audi Sport brand.
“Throughout our 25-year RS history, the Audi RS 6 Avant is one of our absolute icons with a large global fan base,” explained Oliver Hoffmann, Managing Director of Audi Sport GmbH. “As such, we will be tapping into a new market with huge potential and generating further growth.”
Audi Sport: A Quick History
The Audi Sport brand was launched during the 2017 New York International Auto Show. At the time, Audi explained how it would represent their best in track-tested performance, promising eight new models over the next two years for the U.S. alone. Audi aficionados might recall how this division was formerly called quattro GmbH; being inspired by Motorsport hallmarks like the historic Auto Union Silver Arrows and Audi’s own quatto all-wheel drive technology on the rally circuit.
Audi Sport – which exists alongside the automaker’s R and RS models – now extends to corporate Motorsports, customer racing, and performance parts. One of their latest introductions, the 2019 TT RS, is incidentally one of our favorites.
Audi RS 6 Avant: Styling & Design
The exterior consists entirely of RS-specific parts and communicates a new chapter in what Audi dubs as RS design language. The body is wider now (about 1.6 inches on each side) and accented further with special wheel arches and fender flares. The RS 6 Avant is all about the details in the styling department too. For example, the gloss-black Singleframe grille includes a three-dimensional, RS-specific honeycomb structure. At the rear, the RS-style bumper includes a rear diffuser just above the oval chrome exhaust tips. The roof edge even receives its own spoiler.
On the inside, it’s a tech haven with the new MMI touch response system and Audi’s virtual cockpit. The latter displays information on tire pressure, power output, engine oil temperature, boost pressures, lap times, and g forces.
Power & Performance: U.S. Specs Still Forthcoming
At the heart of the Audi RS 6 Avant is a 4.0-liter, twin-turbo V8 and an eight-speed Tiptronic transmission. While U.S. specs are forthcoming, Audi says to expect nearly 600 ponies and 600 lb-ft. of torque from the turbo plant. The RS 6 Avant will hit 62 in 3.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 155, according to Audi. Helping achieve the high speeds are the transmission’s optimized shift points and Audi’s signature quattro permanent all-wheel drive system.

GM to Make Face Masks for Frontline Workers
The quattro sport differential actively splits torque between each of the rear wheels, but can direct nearly all the torque to just one wheel. This enhances handling and cornering ability, be it on a curvy highway or track. Audi put a high priority on the steering, developing a new power-assist system they say provides precise feedback.
The RS 6 Avant offers six different drive modes: comfort, auto, dynamic, efficiency, and the individually-configurable RS1 and RS2 modes. The characteristics of the engine, exhaust, transmission, steering, and suspension change accordingly.
Suspension Tech: A Really Cool System
The Audi RS 6 Avant receives a suspension of the adaptive air variety with different modes. An RS sport suspension with Dynamic Ride Control is also available; and the design is pretty cool. Drivers can adjust the single-tube dampers in three stages. From there, hydraulic lines and a central valve link the diagonally-opposed shock absorbers. While taking corners, Audi says the valves “regulate the oil flow in the shock absorber of the spring-deflected front wheel at the outside of the curve.”
The feature, according to Audi, helps reduce pitch and roll in the interest of better handling.
Audi RS 6 Avant: Pricing & Availability
The Audi RS 6 Avant will arrive in the U.S. next year. Before long, Audi says they will announce exactly when customers can begin placing orders. Pricing was not disclosed.

2019/08/21,Ford Ranger FX2 Shows New Trends In The Truck Market,"The Ford Ranger FX2 offers new styling elements and performance-oriented features. 
FX2 buyers among the growing number wanting more personalized options for their truck. 
The two operative words here are “sporty” and “style.” That’s what you will be getting if you plunk down the cash for the FX2 package on your new Ford Ranger. It’s not going to turn it into a sports car, only give you a more sporty look; and it’s not going to get you climbing up the slopes in Moab; it’ll only give you a more off-road panache. But given the market Ford is aiming for here, it should be right on the mark.
Here is a look at the new Ford Ranger FX2.
Why Are Customers Ordering The Ford Ranger FX2?
The FX2 Package can be added to any two-wheel drive Ford Ranger. Why, you might ask, would anybody want a jazzed-up, non-4×4 pickup? Ford has a simple and direct answer. They’ve noticed more customers are prioritizing truck customization and capability options, so Ford is hoping to get new buyers in the Ranger camp by offering them some of these options in-house. Basically, Ford is trying to get ahead of the game.
“We’re seeing sales trends that tell us to grow Ranger’s capability and appearance options even further,” said Chad Callander, Ford Ranger Consumer Marketing Manager. “The FX2 Package is a result of us listening to our customers and what they’re demanding from their trucks.”
What Is The FX2 Package?
Everything rides on your choice of 17- or 18-inch wheels with off-road tires for a start. The Ranger FX2 Package adds tougher styling cues and capability upgrades like an electronic-locking rear differential and an off-road-tuned suspension. Like Ford’s FX4 trucks, the Ranger FX2 includes a front underbody guard and an off-road cluster screen inside. Essentially, it’s the stuff normally found on the 4×4 Rangers, now with the two-wheel drive offering.
“FX2 expands Ranger’s options for customers who want tough, off-road style with the functionality of a locking differential but don’t need four-wheel drive,” said Brian Bell, Ford Ranger Marketing Manager. “This is another way our customers can personalize Ranger to match their lifestyle while getting a great value.”
That front underbody guard joins an “air dam-delete” for more of an off-road look and even some merit. I mean, that’s pretty much a gimme. Who is going to put an air dam on something that might (possibly) (could) (maybe) go off-road? With the FX2 Package, when you run out of blacktop, the off-road cluster screen shows you such handy info as pitch, roll, and yaw in real time.

A Package Deal
Ford says two out of three Ranger buyers opt for extra personalization options. This includes the Sport and STX Appearance Packages, both offered on the Ranger. By contrast, only one in three select the FX4 Off-Road Package, yet more than half opt for the Trailer Tow Package, also available for the FX2 trim. There are, of course, more than just these options to choose from, but it seems looks are everything these days. The new Black Appearance Package, for example, offers (surprise!) black accents and high-gloss black wheels. The Chrome Appearance Package ditches the subtlety for chrome body accents and bright chrome wheels.
Related: Is an aftermarket warranty right for your Ford truck?
Under The Hood
The new Ranger undergoes the same rigorous testing process as its bigger brother, the F-150. Like Ford’s best-seller, the new Ranger uses a high-strength steel frame and an EcoBoost engine, which creates 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. of torque. When properly equipped, the 2019 Ford Ranger has a 7,500 lbs. towing capacity and a payload capacity of 1,860 lbs.
Pricing & Availability
The new Ford Ranger looks like an affordable, rugged, and maneuverable pickup. And who knows, maybe this new FX2 package will be the perfect partner for any adventure you dream up. It’s not a super expensive add-on either, coming in at $595. The Ford Ranger FX2 can be ordered now with deliveries expected late this year. Starting MSRP for the 2019 Ford Ranger is $24,300 in XL trim; $28,120 for the XLT, and $32,390 for the top-end Lariat.

2019/08/17,Acura Type S Concept: The Sporty Acura We’ve All Been Waiting For,"A new Acura concept ushers in the next generation of Type S performance variants. 
Acura says they will debut two Type S performance variants in the next two years.
Designers say they focused on giving the new Type S Concept a powerful stance. 
The Acura Type S Concept heralds the return of Acura’s sporting roots. If you’re too young to remember the magnificent 90s, Acuras were luxurious and high-performance derivatives of Honda vehicles. But the Japanese car maker had an identity crisis in the late 2000s. It was the time when Acura vehicles grew a “beak,” which exaggerated the body lines of their vehicles.
Now Acura is brandishing the Type S Concept at The Quail, a Motorsports Gathering in Monterey, California. This magnificent ride also graced the Concept Lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. And to tell you honestly, the upcoming Type S doesn’t look like a concept at all. It looks pretty much like the real thing, the kind you buy from Acrua dealerships.
From the looks of it, the Type S is destined to make a definitive bang in the world of sports sedans.
Acura Type S: Brief History Lesson
The legacy starts with the 2001-2003 Acura 3.2CL Type S. It debuted in 2001 with a 260 horsepower 3.2-liter V6; a five-speed automatic with manual shift function; 17-inch wheels and a sport suspension. In the final model year, Acura gave the vehicle a worthy six-speed manual upgrade.
The Acura 3.2TL Type S appeared at that same time with the same engine and transmission as the CL Type S, but it was never offered with a manual box. The Acura TSX Type S, the one I previously mentioned, came to fruition in 2002 with a 2.0-liter i-VTEC four-banger and six-speed manual. The latest Type S is the TL from 2007 to 2008. It’s the third-gen TL with a 3.5-liter, 286 horsepower V6, six-speed manual, quad exhaust, four-piston Brembo brakes, and sport suspension.
Finally, after ten years of absence, Acura is back in the game with the Type S Concept.
Acura Type S Concept: Pretty Much What I Was Expecting
Acura has been flying under the radar in my ever-increasing automotive vocabulary. Back in the early 2000s, a bone-stock Acura RSX Type S with a 220 horsepower K20Z1 motor and six-speed, close-ratio manual transmission demanded respect. You’re higher than a Civic, and your car won’t wag its tail between the legs when dealing with stock Mitsubishi Evos or Subaru Impreza STIs. In tuned spec, I’ve seen many Type S vehicles blow muscle cars in a drag race.
But now, it seems Acura is going after the bigwigs with the Type S Concept – and I’m talking about sportier models like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes CLA or C-Class, Lexus IS, and even the flawed yet unhinged Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. “The return of Type S is instrumental in our mission to return Acura to its performance roots,” said Jon Ikeda, Vice President and Brand Officer at Acura. “From bringing back the NSX, to winning at the highest level of North American sports car racing and ushering in a new generation starting with the RDX, we are revitalizing Acura on the foundation of our original and authentic brand values, piece by piece.”

9 Tesla Concepts We Desperately Hope Become Real
Best of all, the ghastly beak is gone. Drinks (and spliffs) are on me!
Previewing The Next-Generation Acura TLX
Here’s the interesting part: The Type S Concept is previewing the next-gen TLX. In other words, the car you’re seeing here is actually the TLX Type S, and Acura says the whole shebang is coming to North America sooner than you think. If this is what a high-performance version of the upcoming TLX will really look like, I’m all in on the styling.
In fact, I’m really rooting for the Type S Concept’s styling. I was expecting the ridiculousness of the Civic Type R with all those boy-racer flaps, wings, and aero cutouts in the bodywork. Instead, what we’re seeing is a perfect example of restraint. It has a powerful and expressive silhouette, yet the whole darn thing looks so clean. It’s still luxuriously sporty, but the wide track, long hood, and low stance are brandishing some racing DNA.
Good Vibrations
Looking at this car gave me the same giddy emotions I had when I first laid eyes on the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. I had the same butterflies-in-stomach feeling when the Genesis G70 came to market. Never did I think an Acura would make me revisit all those pleasantly giddy sensations. “We’ve been dreaming about a new performance-focused Acura concept car since the Precision Concept debuted,” said Dave Marek, Acura’s Executive Creative Director. “The Type S Concept speaks unambiguously to performance and to the essence of Acura design.”
The newest elements are the jewel-eye headlights, an open-surface diamond pentagon grille (minus the beak, of course), and what Acura calls “Chicane” daytime running lights and taillights. It’s interesting to point out how the lights were inspired by Acura’s ARX-05 Daytona Prototype race car. Told ya’ the Type S Concept has a genuine racing pedigree, didn’t I?
The Really Juicy Bits
Sorry, the heading is a misnomer since Acura has yet to reveal performance figures for the Type S Concept. Since it’s a free country, let me tell you what’s probably in store before the real car arrives next year as a 2021 model.
From the looks of it, the future Type S receives a turbocharged V6 motor, and we reckon twin-turbocharging should do the job quite well. Acura says the Type S comes with Brembo brakes, 285-series summer tires (which hints at a summer release date), and quad exhaust tips. The rear spoiler, side sills, front and rear splitters, and those 21-inch wheels benefit from a forged carbon construction.
By forged carbon, Acura means they bond layers of carbon on top of one another. This exceeds the strength of traditional interwoven carbon, according to Acura.

Letting Those Colors Fly
We also like the Double Apex Blue Pearl finish, a much-needed sigh of relief from all the bright orange cars and crossovers we’re seeing these days. Acura claims the paint employs Nano pigments and a color-infused clear coat which means it isn’t clear at all. Although, it does give the paint a different type of brilliance. Acura is already doing this for the 2020 TLX.
Allow me to blurt out two queries still lingering in my head. First, why did Acura take so long? Second, is the Type S the resurgence of hardcore sport sedans? We’ll have to wait and see.

2019/08/16,2020 Mustang Shelby GT500: More Muscle For America’s Supercar,"The 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 is one of America’s most powerful muscle cars. 
Engineers developed an advanced transmission to handle the GT500’s horsepower.
Zero to 60 in the mid-three-second range and equally-impressive quarter-mile times.
I’ll never forget my first encounter with a Shelby GT500. I was driving along at a gingerly pace when everything came to a halt. Apparently, the Shelby GT500 up ahead was trying to execute a three-point turn on a two-lane road. The car in front – who refused to be bothered by all the commotion – went ahead and passed the Shelby. I, on the other hand, applied the brakes and signaled the Shelby driver to go ahead.
Setting The Stage
Obviously mesmerized by what I was seeing, the Shelby made quite a noise as it lazily made the turn. The driver – who rolled the window down as he completed the turn – gave me a friendly honk, a smiling nod, and stepped on the gas. As he did, I caught the exhaust pipes which exited right under the driver’s door. It was an aftermarket titanium system with a sound I can only describe as mighty loud.
I was 25 in my moderately-flashy, Japanese sports coupe. I’m telling you, seeing this powerful muscle car making a three-point turn ironically became a turning point (no pun intended) in my own life. That moment deepened my passion for the motor car. And if I can’t have them, then I should probably just write about ‘em for passion’s sake.
So here we are with the 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500. I can only assume more power, more ludicrous numbers, more noise, and record-breaking performance. At least, that’s what I thought when I first saw it; and boy, oh boy I was right!
2020 Mustang Shelby GT500: More Powerful Than The Ford GT
I didn’t find this surprising at all the more I examined the specs. However, part of me never expected to see the day when a Mustang would out-power a GT, but here we are, as ridiculous as it seems. Although they are two very different vehicles, the GT supercar settles for a 647 horsepower version of Ford’s turbocharged EcoBoost V6. By comparison, the 2020 Shelby GT 500 comes with a supercharged, 5.2-liter V8 mill producing 760 horsepower and a staggering 625 lb-ft. of torque.
When you think the same motor only churns out 526 horsepower in the Shelby GT350 and 350R, the figures are mind-boggling, to say the least. In many ways, the new Shelby GT500 is heading into the stratosphere. And we’re not even talking about banging heads with a McLaren, Ferrari, Lamborghini, or some other supercar. The new Shelby GT500 is still a Mustang, which means it’s the same car you take to the grocery store as well as to the track.

Power is transferred to the rear wheels via a 3.73:1 Torsen limited-slip differential. In addition, the 2020 Shelby GT500 features an independent rear suspension, larger half shafts, and a carbon-fiber driveshaft to reduce what Ford calls torsional distortion and rotational mass. And with 760 horses stampeding in full force, the 2020 Shelby GT500 is officially the most powerful car Ford has produced in all its 116 years of existence.
High-Tech Automatic Transmission
Still mourning the loss of a proper stick in today’s cars? I am too, but we have to man up and move on! It makes more sense to give a car like the new Chevy Corvette Stingray a standard dual-clutch automatic. The same logic applies here. The good news is, automatic transmissions are not the slush boxes of yore. Today, they actually improve performance by executing shifts much faster than a human can. Or should we say, more effectively than a human can.
“Contrary to popular belief, fast shifts do not always equate to better road performance,” explained Pat Morgan, Ford Performance Powertrain Manager. “In every driving situation, we emulated what professional drivers do; whether it’s a smooth, precise heel-and-toe shift of a professional track driver or a much more forceful power shift like drag racers.”
Ford did their homework and decided to mate a Tremec TR-9070 DCT seven-speed dual-clutch automatic to the new Shelby GT500. “Effortlessly handling the 760 horsepower is our segment-first, Tremec dual-clutch transmission, with an advanced control system that enhances GT500’s five drive modes to deliver a driving experience once reserved only for exotic supercars,” said Ed Krenz, Ford Performance Chief Program Engineer. “The range of brute-force drag acceleration, seamless road shifts, and amazingly smooth shifts on the track further highlights how the soul of the Shelby GT500 is elevated in our most advanced Mustang ever.”

80 Milliseconds Flat
The Tremec TR-9070 DCT utilizes a novel wet clutch system with five friction plates in the odd-gear pack, across 155 square inches of surface area. Meanwhile, the even-gear pack has six friction plates providing 136 square inches of surface area. Combined with seven non-sequential helical forward gears with triple cone synchronizers, the system can easily match the engine’s torque curve for stupendously fast and effective shifts. In fact, the system engages the gears in 80 milliseconds in Sport mode.
“In many ways, this is like having two transmissions in one,” Morgan said. “On one hand, it enables performance at the outer reaches of straight-line quickness with minimal torque interruption, yet provides an incredible amount of finesse and control in track environments for maximum stability and predictability at the limits of lateral acceleration.”

Zero To 100 & Back Again
Ford says every driving mode in the new Shelby GT500 alters the personality and on-road behavior of the vehicle. For instance, going from normal to track mode changes the throttle response and gear selections. The system also changes the dampening, stability control, exhaust sound, and even the instrument panel.
Others newsworthy features include an rpm-selectable launch control with electronic line lock; available carbon fiber wheels and bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires; and the largest front brakes of any domestic sports coupe. With 16.5-inch front rotors, Ford says the new Shelby GT500 achieves zero to 100 mph, and back to zero again in a scant 10.6 seconds.

To better cool the incoming air, Ford’s engineers inverted a 2.65-liter roots-type supercharger, with an air-to-liquid inter-cooler, and tucked it away in the engine’s valley. Ford says this design also lowers the 5.2-liter V8’s center of gravity. To optimize performance, the aluminum alloy block features wire-arc cylinder liners and high-flow aluminum cylinder heads; plus larger forged connecting rods. Beneath that, a structural oil pan features an active baffle system to keep oil where it’s needed.
Pricing & Availability
Ford has yet to release the MSRP for the 2020 Shelby GT500 as of this writing. We reckon it will start around $70,000 before options. First deliveries begin later this year, and I cannot wait to finally take one for a drive, especially in Sport mode.
“Every aspect of the Shelby GT500 driving experience changes with the mode – be that the throttle responsiveness and snap of the shifts you feel in the seat of your pants, or the ‘pop and burble’ of the exhaust in performance modes,” Morgan said. “It’s a full, multi-sensory visceral experience.”

2019/08/14,New Interactive Game Highlights The Dangers of Distracted Driving,"Research finds that distracted driving is one of the top causes of accidents worldwide. 
Kwik Fit’s interactive Driven To Distraction game shows just how dangerous it can be.  
The new game tests your traffic and safety knowledge, along with your reaction time.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving accounted for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. Distracted driving is anything that takes your attention from the road, although it’s most commonly associated with smartphone usage. NHTSA finds that sending or reading a text takes approximately five seconds, enough to travel the length of a football field at 55 mph. With the average speed limits of U.S. states being well over 55 mph, it makes distracted driving all that more dangerous.
A new, interactive game from Kwik Fit, a leading automotive service provider in the United Kingdom, highlights the dangers of distracted driving. Like in the U.S., distracted driving is also a concern in the UK. The Department for Transport finds the number of vehicle fatalities caused by smartphone usage is on the rise. Officials and safety advocates describe the latest statistics as a wake-up call.

Driven To Distraction
Kwik Fit’s Driven To Distraction game tests your road knowledge and your reaction time. The object is to read a text message in the form of a question, and respond with the correct answer; all while looking out for STOP signs. There are three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard with the car moving quicker and the questions becoming increasingly harder with each level. The questions deal with the rules of the road, and although they are not more than a sentence long, it’s easy to miss the STOP signs. Kwik Fit developed the game to bring attention to the dangers of distracted driving.
Tougher Than We Realized
The question “What should the left-hand lane of a motorway be used for?” we did not answer fast enough, despite it being a relatively easy one. In fact, we could hardly read the multiple choice answers! We quickly clicked our mouse when we caught the STOP sign, avoiding the question entirely. However, we were still 0.190 seconds slower while using the phone, despite abandoning the question. According to Kwik Fit’s Driven To Distraction game, at 30 mph, this would have taken us nearly nine additional feet to stop. That may not sound like a lot, but it can be the difference between life and death.

At one point, we missed the STOP sign by more than three seconds because of looking at the phone. As a result, we traveled over 150 feet past where we needed to stop! We’ve included the screenshot below.
Related: Distracted driving kills and it’s a worldwide problem.
How To Play
Begin by concentrating as the car is moving; when you see the STOP sign, click on the screen. On the next round, a phone will appear obstructing your view. A question about road safety and/or traffic laws will come up; read it carefully and select the right answer. Try to get as many correct as you can, but click the mouse when you see a STOP sign.
Kwik Fit’s Driven To Distraction game records your time on reach round. You can play with your friends at the office to see who has the best reaction times. On your way home, remember to buckle up and drive defensively. Place your phone in the center console or out of reach so don’t look at it while driving.

2019/08/09,Automated Drive West: VSI Labs Going Cross County In Autonomous Car,"It’s a hot afternoon in the Twin Cities and the offices of VSI Labs are bustling. The team only has so much time before their upcoming cross-country trip in an autonomous test car. The company’s engineers and researchers are combing over every last detail before they depart for the Automated Drive West. Road trips are one thing, but traveling 2,000 miles in an autonomous vehicle is another ball game. VSI Founder and Principal Advisor, Phil Magney, who races Porsches in his spare time, ducks into his car to talk about the upcoming trip.
It’s the only quiet place he can find this particular afternoon.
“I just want to emphasize that we aren’t out to prove anything here, that’s not what we’re doing,” Magney said. “We’re researchers; it’s all about discovery, understanding the limits, and finding the gaps when it comes to automated driving.”
Automated Drive West: The Test Car
VSI will make the 2,000-mile journey from their Minneapolis, Minnesota home to Santa Clara, California for the Drive World conference starting on August 27th. The Automated Drive West will expose their test car, a 2018 Ford Fusion with a Dataspeed by-wire control system, to a variety of terrains and weather conditions. On the journey, the team will examine and evaluate things like precision lane models and advanced GPS technology. The goal being to improve the performance and safety of both systems as they relate to autonomous driving.
“We will be able to test some of the automated features in data collection environments that we’re not normally used to, like a lot of rural highways, mountainous areas, and tunnels and what not,” Magney explained. “The data will be tremendously useful because we can document precisely where the vehicle runs into trouble; we can replay these problem areas when we get back and apply more permanent fixes.”
Among the high-tech systems within the VSI test Fusion is a special Linux-based computer, custom-built by the engineering team. This computer is essentially the brain, acting as the central controller for the car’s on-board autonomous driving systems. As the test vehicle’s most vital organ, careful measures are being taken to protect it. “The computer gear we have in the trunk generates a lot of heat, so we are engineering a unique kind of adaptation of the HVAC system to provide proper cooling,” Magney said.
Examining The Ecosystem
VSI Labs is an ambitious and robust company when it comes to automotive safety and technology research. The company builds vehicles to examine how different technologies interact with each other; and to better understand how they function when it comes to autonomous driving. VSI’s engineering team routinely analyzes by-wire control systems, sensor fusion applications, and precision localization; each important to the inner-workings of an autonomous vehicle. From there, VSI offers various research portals that support product and technology planning; competitive analysis and IP discovery; and product engineering and development.

Magney worked in automotive technology for 20 years, serving in senior leadership roles before starting VSI Labs in 2014. He describes the VSI approach as a decomposition of the ecosystem. The mindset allows Magney and his team to get a more accurate picture of autonomous vehicle technologies, their corresponding systems, and their overall capabilities.
“I felt that was going to be extremely important: to really understand the underpinnings of this technology,” he continued. “That really understanding, for example, the ecosystem according to sensors: so who makes these sensors? What are they used for? What do they look like and so forth. But it doesn’t stop there because there are a lot of components necessary to build up an active safety or automated driving system.”
From RC Cars To Real Ones
VSI today has examined thousands of products and represented over 800 companies, from Silicon Valley startups to multinational OEMs. Magney says things began humbly enough with “desk research,” but quickly evolved. “Within about a year and a half, we realized that to really understand this space we’ve got to go deeper and that means setting up a lab,” he recalled. “Honestly it started with building a 1/10 scale car, like an RC car, and automating that. Nearly right after, we ordered our first real vehicle. We used that to start building safety applications and lower-level automation features.”
Safety First
We first met VSI Labs at AutoSens Detroit in May of last year. The team brought a Tesla from their Minneapolis office they routinely work on and benchmark. “We wanted to come to Detroit to show AutoSens attendees and delegates some of the new features we put in the car,” Magney told us when we met him. Later that day, we took a ride in their automated Tesla with Engineering Project Manager and chief driver Sara Sargent. “Safety is always the goal with this technology,” she said as we cruised across Warren Avenue in Detroit in autonomous mode.
“I always come at it from a safety background, so to me, the stuff we’re working on is as much about safety as it is automated driving,” Magney added. “I know it sounds like a cliché, but we believe everything we do helps advance that goal, that mission, or that trajectory of these technologies.”
Driving With Purpose
Sargent will assume the same role when they depart the Twin Cites on August 20th for the Automated Drive West. She, like Magney, doesn’t get too carried away. This is more about hands-on science versus hands-off the steering wheel. “The Automated Drive West isn’t about reading emails, watching movies, or napping,” Sargent explained. “This trip will apply a few technologies that are particularly useful in rural settings where infrastructure is at a minimum.”
RELATED

“To give you a little more background, we are using something called Real-Time Kinematics, often used in agriculture and in some marine applications,” Magney said. “It augments the accuracy by a great deal, so coupling that high-end GPS with our high-definition maps; those two working together will do most of the heavy lifting on the journey.”
Eagle Eyes
During the Automated Drive West, VSI’s test Fusion will employ two important autonomous vehicle applications: adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. Both will utilize data from high-definition maps and on-board sensors, supported by algorithms developed by the engineering team. Special scripts were then written so map data, relative to the vehicle’s location, can be downloaded at any given time. The adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems will adjust accordingly to any new map data while on the trip.
“What it boils down to is our GPS system in this car has accuracy down to a few centimeters rather than a few meters,” Magney explained. “In other words, we’ll be able to localize with precision using our high-end GPS.”
As the new map data arrives, the Fusion’s steering slowly transitions from the current path to the new one. Although not always necessary, the gradual transition allows the driver time to react should any errors occur in the loading of the new map. “One of the significant things about this test is that we can isolate the functionalities of these technologies,” Magney said. “A lot of times we will be tweaking the algorithms on the fly in order to make certain adjustments. And we always have a trained safety operator and driver behind the wheel.”
Follow The Automated Drive West
The Automated Drive West kicks off in Minneapolis on August 20th. The VSI team will drive four days to their destination in Santa Clara. On arrival, they will offer demo rides in the vehicle at Informa’s Drive World Conference & Expo from August 27th to the 29th. You can follow the journey in real-time on social media, either through the VSI Labs Twitter and/or Facebook page. The team plans on stopping at places like Mount Rushmore, The Great Salt Lake, and Olympic Valley.
“It’s going to be a terrific test of these systems because we’ll see so many unique environmental conditions along the way,” Magney said. “Of course, we will have live telemetry and other neat kinds of features so people can follow along with how we’re doing.”

2019/08/08,"The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering Goes Hollywood","The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering is teaming with the Petersen Automotive Museum this year.
A new display will include six cars and one motorcycle from some of Hollywood’s most adored films.
You know about The Quail, right? Officially dubbed The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering, it’s one of the very fun things to do at the Monterey Historics every year. You have been down to Monterey, right? Well, if you haven’t, go. If you’re thinking about going back this year, then definitely do so. Because The Quail is partnering with LA’s Petersen Museum to bring some rather tasty rides to their annual event.
Hollywood Dream Machines
I actually covered the Petersen Museum’s Hollywood Dream Machines exhibit back in May. The exhibition features over 40 Hollywood vehicles, props, and costumes. The Audi RSQ concept, driven by Will Smith in i, Robot; the Warthog from Halo; the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, and a bunch of other instantly-recognizable rides are on display. And while this is a fun thing see, someone came up with the bright idea of taking the show on the road, so to speak.
The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering will showcase a selection of these iconic movie cars from the Petersen Automotive Museum, beginning Friday August 16th. The display will include six cars and one motorcycle from some of our favorite films. Once again, the legendary 1981 DeLorean from Back to the Future will be on display. Michael Keaton’s Batmobile from the 1989 Batman film will also be on display (that would be the first big Hollywood version, the one directed by Tim Burton). Joining them is the 1999 Mach 5 Prototype race car inspired by the classic 1966 animated series Speed Racer. (And this might be the same one from the Wachowskis over-the-top movie, but info is sketchy).
Shagin’ Wagon
Austin Powers fans can enjoy the “Shagmobile,” the 1998 VW Beetle Mike Meyers drove around; while those old enough to remember will appreciate the race-prepared, 1961 VW Beetle from The Love Bug. Wait, scratch that. It’s from the 2005 film Herbie: Fully Loaded that starred the unfortunate Lindsay Lohan. The last of the six is the 1946 Ford “Greased Lightning,” customized by world-famous car builder George Barris for the 1975 John Travolta, Olivia Newton John movie Grease. The lone motorcycle is the LEGO Batcycle.
Special Classes
In addition to all the tinsel town glitz and glamour, The Quail will also do its always impressive gearhead-related stuff. Essentially, world-class displays on the picturesque rolling fairways of the Quail Lodge & Golf Club. There are three special classes this year. The first will be 100 Years of Bentley Motors, celebrating W.O.’s finest. Some of the highlighted Bentley vehicles include a 1929 Le Mans, 1926 Speed Six, 1958 S1 Continental Coupe by Park Ward, and a 2018 Supersports. The second special class is the 25th anniversary celebration of the McLaren F1, which makes me feel older than I am. The third special class is called A Tribute to the Electric Car Movement.

Family & Pet Friendly
If you attend, you will enjoy The Quail’s unique garden-party setting with an array of culinary pavilions, wine vendors (award-winning of course), and a fireside chat series. You can also attend the Bonham’s Quail Lodge Auction taking place simultaneously on the Quail Lodge Farm Field. And shoot, bring the kids and the dog, because, as always, the show will offer a family and pet-friendly environment. More information and a complete list of all the festivities can be found here.

2019/08/07,2020 Nissan Versa Arrives: A Lot of Car For Under 20K,"The 2020 Nissan Versa arrives at dealers with a starting MSRP under $15,000.
A new four cylinder produces 12 percent more power than the prior generation.
Buyers on a budget will appreciate the new Versa’s strong fuel economy numbers.   
The Versa is one of Nissan’s best-sellers, and with the redone and reimagined 2020 model, the Versa gives a clear example of what the company will be hanging a lot of hopes on in terms of design. Nissan went for a more dramatic and expressive exterior while trying to move the interior features and overall quality up a class. Despite this, the 2020 Nissan Versa is inexpensive; and I mean, like, very inexpensive. The new Versa, which just arrived at dealerships, has a starting price of just $14,730 when equipped with a manual transmission.
How Is The 2020 Nissan Versa Equipped?
The Versa comes in three flavors: the S 1.6 (with either a manual gearbox or the automatic Xtronic), the SV 1.6 Xtronic, and the top-of-the-line SR 1.6 Xtronic. These range in price from that low starting point of under 15 grand, up to $18,240 for the full-zoot Versa SR 1.6 Xtronic. Across the board, those are very low prices for a modern car. In all seriousness, the 2020 Nissan Versa is ideal for any first-time buyer or those on a strict budget.
As we’ve come to expect with Nissan products, you’ll get a lot for your money. This is the third generation for the Versa, and the company eagerly points out how it fully embraces Nissan’s new Intelligent Mobility technology. Furthermore, Nissan’s Safety Shield 360, a suite of advanced safety and intervention technologies, is standard on SV and SR grades. Safety Shield 360 includes Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection; Rear Automatic Braking and Lane Departure Warning; High Beam Assist, Blind Spot Warning, and Rear Cross Traffic Alert.
Styling & Design
The new design is a lower, wider, and longer affair that retains Versa’s interior space, according to Nissan. It has all the current family design traits, what Nissan calls the “Emotional Geometry” design language. So you’ll see such things as the new Versa’s V-motion grille; the boomerang-style headlamps and taillights; kick-up C-pillars and floating roof. You get your choice of eight exterior colors although Nissan only tells us of three: Electric Blue Metallic, Monarch Orange Metallic, and Scarlet Ember Tintcoat.
The interior now features Nissan’s “Gliding Wing” instrument panel with a “floating” seven-inch touchscreen display. These elements are complimented by the sporty, D-shaped steering wheel, keyless entry, push button start, automatic climate control, and the available heated front seats. Other tech and convenience goodies include standard Bluetooth audio and phone capabilities (with steering wheel controls); Siri Eyes Free, Hands-free Text Messaging Assistant, and a USB connection port for your iPod.

Power & Performance
The latest Versa is powered by the next-generation of Nissan’s 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. The small plant puts out 122 horsepower and 114 lb-ft. of torque when paired with the Xtronic automatic or the available five-speed manual (Versa S only). Fuel economy is, as you would expect, really good: 32/40 city/highway and 35 combined with the Xtronic automatic. Curiously, the five-speed manual does worse: 27/35 city/highway and 30 combined. Ah, well.
The “high performance” model would be the Versa SR. Nissan says it “adds an extra touch of sportiness,” which makes me cringe. The SR package gets you 17-inch aluminum alloy wheels wrapped in 205/50 R17 all-season tires, and LED headlights and fog lights. There is an optional SR Convenience Package with heated front seats and Intelligent Cruise Control.
No, it’s not a Bentley or even an Infiniti, but it is under $20,000 and you get a lot for that little scratch.

2019/08/06,2020 Porsche 911 Carrera & 911 Carrera Cabriolet: A Brief Walk Around,"The new 911 Carrera and Carrera Cabriolet expand the 911 model range.
Model-specific turbos help the flat six engine crank out nearly 380 horsepower.   
Expect the new 911s this fall with all-wheel drive variants arriving at a later date. 
After the introduction of the latest versions of the evergreen 911, the Carrera S and 4S, Porsche is expanding the range again with the 911 Carrera and Carrera Cabriolet. And these will not be just fluffy, badge-engineered cars, nope. The 2020 Carreras are set to get model-specific turbo engines for one thing. Yas, yas. The one word that should strike fear into the hearts of your competition (and you, if you’ve ever gone over the edge in an original 911/930 Turbo). Either way, Porsche is back for another bite of the performance apple for 2020.
Obviously, this very much counts as good news, but what sets apart the Carrera models from the S and 4S?
2020 Porsche 911 Carrera: Engine & Transmission
For a start, like the 2020 911 S and 4S, the new Carrera and Cabriolet are motivated by a twin-turbo 3.0-liter flat six engine. For the Carrera, model-specific turbochargers crank out a very healthy 379 horsepower and 331 lb-ft. of torque. That equates to a nine horsepower bump from the previous 911 Carrera. The standard gearbox is the eight-speed PDK unit that allows the 2020 911 Carrera to hit 60 in four seconds flat. If you opt for the optional Sport Chrono Package, that time will drop to 3.8 seconds. Either time works out to an improvement over to the previous 911 Carrera Coupe with the PDK transmission.
The Cabriolet offers similar performance numbers. 60 mph comes up in 4.2 seconds or four seconds flat when you go with the optional Sport Chrono Package. The hardtop 911 Carrera reaches 182 mph, while the 911 Carrera Cabriolet can hit 180. Porsche goes out of their way to say this is the “top track speed.” Ain’t they cute.
Suspension, Tires & Braking
Both the 911 Carrera and Carrera Cabriolet come with Porsche’s Active Suspension Management or PASM. Just like on the Carrera S and 4S, this electronically-variable damping system comes standard and offers two selectable modes: Normal and Sport. The wheels have a staggered diameter with 19 inchers at the front and 20 inchers at the back. They are skinned with 235/40 ZR 19 and 295/35 ZR 20 tires, respectively. There’s an optional 20/21 inch staggered setup, pulled from the Carrera S and 4S.
Related: Better consult your doctor before driving the Porsche 911 Speedster.
Brakes, always a Porsche strong point, feature internally-ventilated and cross-drilled, grey cast-iron rotors. These are 13 inches, both front and rear, and feature black four-piston calipers. If you want to stop even quicker, Porsche’s Ceramic Composite Brakes are on offer. As on the S models, Wet Mode is standard equipment. Wet Mode automatically detects water and matches the stability control and anti-lock brake systems to suit. It even warns the driver.

2020 Porsche 911 Carrera: Exterior & Interior Treatments
The outsides of the 911 Carrera models are set apart by their fender arches and front luggage compartment lid, reminiscent of classic 911s. There’s also that new, full-width LED light strip stretching across the rear. Get used to seeing that, it’s going to be a Porsche signature for a while. The only difference between the standard 911 Carreras and the S/4S derivatives are the exhaust openings. Standard 911 Carrera models feature a big rectangular, single-tube tailpipe on each side; while the S models get a set of round twin tailpipes on each side. The optional Sport Exhaust system is available.
On the inside of the new 911 Carrera you’ll find pieces previously introduced on the S models. This includes the seats, the centrally-positioned tachometer (a fine Porsche tradition), and the new Porsche Communication Management system. The five toggle switch buttons below the touchscreen make for a nice addition as well.
Pricing & Availability
If you want one (and I bet you do), go ahead and put your order in now. Your car should reach dealers early next year, with the 911 Carrera ringing out at $97,400 and the Cabriolet retailing for $110,200. The next big news from Porsche: all-wheel drive versions coming soon!

Did you know the Cadillac XT5 is the brand’s best-selling model worldwide? That shouldn’t be all that surprising, given the popularity of SUVs, especially luxury ones, and Caddy’s inroads into the Chinese market. So with that as a background, you can see why Cadillac opted for only a revamp on their sales leader, and not a full-on redesign. Still, the refresh is as comprehensive as they come. Cadillac says over 40 different items were updated for the XT5 for 2020.
Here is a look at what to expect when the XT5 hits the dealership.
What Are The 2020 Cadillac XT5 Trim Levels?
For the new model year, the 2020 Cadillac XT5 comes in four trim levels: Luxury, Premium Luxury (a redundantly named trim level if nothing else), and Sport. The Premium Luxury emphases bright trim and contemporary décor, while the Sport goes darker and more aggressive. As you would expect, Luxury and Premium Luxury are oriented towards comfort, and provide a “retreat from road disturbances” as Cadillac says. The Sport, by contrast, has quicker steering and more aggressive chassis tuning and stuff like that.
Luxury and Premium Luxury models get 18-inch wheels standard, although a new 20-inch wheel is available. The XT5 Sport gets the 20-inchers standard. Across the range, you’ll find a new grille design, available in two textures, and an available Platinum package for more tech.
And Speaking of Tech . . .
Caddy has no problem loading in as much as the bean counters will allow, and infotainment and driver assistance technologies take center stage. The new XT5 now has over 20 available safety and driver aids as a matter of fact. The XT5’s “user experience interface” receives an upgrade, as does the rotary controller with more comprehensive jog functionality. Please note this complements the conventional buttons and touchscreen, but does not do away with them entirely. This is a great move. Hörst du German auto manufacturers?
When Cadillac says user experience interface, they mean the eight-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, various apps, and an available 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot. One-touch phone pairing with Near Field Communication is there, but this is slowly becoming standard, especially on high-end rides like the XT5.

Interior Treatments
This is a Cadillac, so of course the comfort and convenience goodies will make you feel like you’re driving a suite at the Hilton. There are new interior “themes,” each incorporating a richer selection of authentic materials and coordinating décor. There’s also a new Jet Black/Kona Brown theme that includes premium leather seats, door trim, and armrests. Further accents come by way of new designs for the center console and cup holders (natch).
Best of all, there’s a new Bose Performance Series sound system.
2020 Cadillac XT5: Power & Performance
The engine bay for the XT5 gets a new choice for 2020. The 2.0L Turbo is now standard for Luxury and Premium Luxury; the existing 3.6L V6 remains standard for the Sport, but is still an option on the Premium Luxury. Both engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic, controlled via the next generation of Cadillac’s Electronic Precision Shift technology.
The turbo found on the 2.0L is a trick, twin-scroll setup with a unique three-step sliding camshaft. Cadillac says the design optimizes performance across the rev band. Don’t say VTEC, although that’s essentially what it is. Bottom line here is an okay 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. The six-banger, on the other hand, puts out 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft. of torque thanks to direct injection and camshaft phasing. There’s also Active Fuel Management (cylinder deactivation) and automatic stop/start to help fuel economy.
If you opt for the 2.0L Turbo, you’ll also get a new, electronically-controlled braking system replacing the conventional vacuum-assisted system. Would you look at that. Caddy finally got out of the 1950s!
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Cadillac XT5 is available now for a starting MSRP of $44,095.

2019/08/03,2020 Subaru Legacy: A Brief Run Through The Trim Levels & Pricing,"The 2020 Subaru Legacy ushers in the sedan’s seventh generation.
A new Touring trim will feature genuine Nappa leather, a first for Subaru.
Pricing is reasonable across all trim levels. Expect the new Legacy this fall.
In the market for a new Subaru? A new Legacy perhaps? Then now might be a good time, because the automotive arm of Fuji Heavy Industries just announced how much it’s going to cost to put a 2020 Legacy in your garage. Hint: not that much. For a start, the Legacy increases by only $200 for 2020. Given what the car comes with as standard these days, that’s not much of a bump.
Subaru Legacy: All About The Eyes
Every 2020 Subaru Legacy is equipped with the company’s EyeSight Driver Assist Technology and now features Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control with Lane Centering. On top of that, the EyeSight Assist Monitor provides a heads-up display with all the warnings and system statuses on the windshield. The headlights are now fully LEDs and integrate Subaru’s High Beam Assist feature. The Legacy comes in six models: Base, Premium, Sport, Limited, Limited XT, and Touring XT.
The base level starts at $22,745, which is entirely reasonable. The Base trim gets a Starlink multimedia system with two snazzy, seven-inch touchscreens (upper and lower) to control different vehicle functions. The multimedia system – that would be “the radio” for you old school people out there – features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. SiriusXM and Travel Link subscriptions are available as well. There are new Starlink apps along with Clari-Fi music restoration.
Related: Literally more of everything. An in-depth look at the 2020 Subaru Legacy.
Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive & Torque Vectoring
Naturally, even the entry-level trim is standard with Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive and Active Torque Vectoring systems. It feels funny to mention that. Doesn’t every Subie have all-wheel standard? I mean, that’s why you buy a Subaru in the first place. Anyhoo, the Base trim gets a new version of the 2.5-liter Boxer engine that cranks out 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft. of torque. The plant is mated with a Lineartronic CVT while Auto Start-Stop helps improve fuel efficiency.
2020 Subaru Legacy: Premium & Sport Trims
The 2020 Subaru Legacy Premium starts at $24,995 and contains upgrades over the Base trim. The All-Weather Package, for example, gives you heated front seats, heated exterior mirrors and windshield wiper de-icer; a leather-wrapped steering wheel; dual-zone automatic climate control, and a 10-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support. Power-folding exterior mirrors (body color) with integrated turn signals are standard as well.

The Premium trim has two option packages. The first includes Blind-Spot Detection, Lane Change Assist, Rear-Cross Traffic Alert, push-button start, and LED fog lights. The second adds a power moonroof and an 11.6-inch Multimedia Nav system.
The next trim level up for the 2020 Subaru Legacy is the Sport, starting at $26,945 (still reasonable). The Sport receives 18-inch wheels in a black finish, a sportier front grille, body color rocker trim, and a trunk spoiler. Another exclusive Sport trim piece is the two-tone cloth interior with red accent stitching. A power moonroof, Reverse Automatic Braking, and Blind-Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist are among the available options.
Limited & Limited XT
The next-to-the-top Limited has a starting price of $29,745. Just under $30k, but still pretty inexpensive. It adds more luxurious features like perforated, leather-trimmed upholstery, heated rear seats, rear-seat air conditioner outlets, and a 10-way power driver’s seat with two-position memory and power lumbar. In the Limited, front passengers get their own eight-way power chair. Other goodies include 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels (black with machine finish); LED fog lights and push-button start; Reverse Automatic Braking, Steering Responsive Headlights, and Blind-Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert.
Now we come to the Legacy Limited XT. When you plunk down your $34,195 you’ll get a new, 260 horsepower 2.4-liter plant. It’s paired with a high-torque Lineartronic CVT with eight-speed manual control and steering wheel paddle shifters. And at the top of the ladder, we see a first for the 2020 Legacy in the Touring. The Legacy Touring XT gets you everything from the Limited XT but adds a Front View Monitor and Nappa leather interior. Starting price for the Legacy Touring XT is still reasonable at $35,895.
With all-wheel drive, plenty of technology and features, and a manageable price point, it’s hard to go wrong with the 2020 Subaru Legacy.

2019/08/03,2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45: Compact Benz Packs A Mean Punch,"2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 debuts with the world’s most powerful four-cylinder.
The engine produces over 380 horsepower and sprints to 60 mph in just four seconds. 
Expect the new Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 later this year, with pricing due close to that time. 
The 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 is finally here. It’s essentially a compact sport-luxury car with the power and torque output of a muscle car. It carries the same design language as the larger CLS but is no bigger than a C-Class. In short, it’s a small little monster packing a mean punch. Over the next few minutes, we will take a look at the new Mercedes-AMG CLA 45.
And it’s only fitting we start with the engine.
Mercedes-AMG M139 Engine
The outgoing Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 is by no means a slow car. It came with the M133 engine producing 375 horsepower. However, if there’s one thing not so good with the old engine, it’s that it has a tendency to dump all its torque at lower engine speeds. Enter the new M139 engine. For starters, it’s the most powerful production four-cylinder in the world. In the 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45, the motor is good for 382 horsepower and 354 lb-ft. of torque, a reasonable jump from the previous output. Quite honestly, that’s a lot of oomph from a humble 2.0-liter four-cylinder.
Mercedes-AMG claims a zero to 60 time of only four seconds while top speed is electronically-limited to 155 mph. The optional AMG Driver’s Package increases that to 168 mph (so order that). More importantly, the motor is tuned to behave like a naturally-aspirated mill. Peak torque arrives at 5,200 rpm while Mercedes claims instant shove from as low as 1,000 to 2,000 rpm. And here’s the bad news: the M139 engine is also available in S form with 415 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. Sounds good, right, but that version is only available in the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S, which incidentally won’t be coming to the good ole’ USA.
Why? We have no idea. But to be fair, 382 horsepower is still plentiful for what is really a smallish and compact Mercedes. But then again, really Mercedes? America is all about horsepower. We can handle it.
2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45: One Man, One Engine
It’s not easy being the most powerful four-cylinder engine in the world. Mercedes had to develop a high-tech production line in Affalterbach to make it a reality. And since we’re talking about an AMG motor versus a mass-produced mill, each M139 plant is built using the AMG principle of One Man, One Engine; meaning the engine is built by hand and by a single person from start to finish. Technicians utilize a barrage of intelligent power tools that record each individual torque application. It allows technicians to build the engine in utmost precision while monitoring each and every step in the process.

Because if you’re building the world’s most powerful four-cylinder engine, you don’t take any chances with ordinary hand tools.
With this method, AMG technicians position the turbocharger and the exhaust manifold at the rear of the engine (on the side of the firewall when viewed from behind). The intake system is then at the front. Mercedes-AMG says this configuration creates the flattest possible and most aerodynamically-advantageous design for the engine’s front area. Furthermore, the turbine housing divides into two flow passages running parallel to one another. The divided ducts in the exhaust manifold make it possible to feed the exhaust’s flow to the turbine separately. The design prevents the individual cylinders from influencing each other negatively during load cycles, which according to Mercedes-AMG, helps boost toque.
It sounds like space age stuff, but this is how Mercedes-AMG rolls.
Dual Water Pumps & Dual Injectors
A high-revving and high-output motor will usually require the cooling capacity of a small nuclear generator. With that in mind, Mercedes-AMG gave the M139 engine a set of dual water pumps. The first is a high-performance mechanical unit supplying coolant to the aluminum cylinder head. The second is an electric water pump that operates independently from the mechanical one. In fact, this pump stays running even if the motor is off. This ensures the crankcase is always cooled as efficiently and as quickly as possible.
The M139 engine uses two-stage fuel injection. In normal operation, the engine receives fuel from a set of piezo injectors operating at 2,900 psi. If you’re really pushing it, the motor engages the second set of fuel injectors (with solenoid valves) mounted in the intake manifold. The injectors operate at 97.2 psi and help the engine achieve the highest possible output.

2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45: Transmission Tech
The 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 makes good use of a new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. Power transfers to all four wheels via a fully-variable, 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive system. The drivetrain offers two distinct advantages. First, it’s a rear-biased system to give the driver the feeling of being shoved from the back. Next, the rear axle differential features AMG Torque Control. The latter means torque is not only split between the front and rear wheels, but it can also alter the torque delivery between the left and right rear wheels.
The result of all this wizardry is sure-footed traction whether on the street or racetrack. Best of all, the drive torque is controlled by an electromechanical system – one which Mercedes claims has a faster response and is more refined than a similar electro-hydraulic unit. This also means the new Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 can be fitted with an optional Drift mode. In this setting, all the power is routed to the rear wheels so you can perform ludicrous, tail-sliding maneuvers in your compact luxury Mercedes-AMG.

High-Performance Everything
Without a doubt, the 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 is a small car but a high performing one. It has a high-performance engine, transmission, and driveline – but it also needs a high-performance suspension. Mercedes obliges with a McPherson strut design in the front and a four-link rear with three transverse control arms and a single trailing arm. The AMG Ride Control adaptive damping system is optional.
If the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 can go like the wind, it needs to stop on a dime as well. The car is fitted with four-piston monobloc fixed calipers on 13.8 x 1.3-inch discs at the front, while the rear gets a single-piston floating caliper on 13 x 0.9-inch brake discs. The calipers have a gray finish with white AMG lettering while the discs are internally-ventilated and perforated to dissipate heat and prevent fade.
The car also receives speed-sensitive, electro-mechanical power steering and an AMG exhaust. The latter utilizes a flap to alter the exhaust sound depending on the selected driving mode. Speaking of driving modes, the CLA 45 has six, ranging from comfort to sporty (and even a race mode!).
Sporting & Luxurious Interior
The highlight of the interior is the new MBUX infotainment system. It creates a closer connection between man and machine by using advanced artificial intelligence. The system responds to voice commands so you don’t need to take your hands off the wheel to change vehicle settings.
Drivers will settle into the contoured front seats trimmed in black MB-Tex and DINAMICA microfiber. The multi-function steering wheel is wrapped in Nappa leather while the gearshift paddles are milled from galvanized aluminum. Stainless steel pedals with rubber studs, black roof liner, and stainless steel front entry sills with AMG lettering complete the sporting theme.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 is everything you can ask for from a modern Mercedes. Deliveries begin in late 2019 with pricing to be announced closer to that time.

2019/07/30,"If You Like The Audi A6, Wait Until You See The 2020 Audi S6","The 2020 Audi S6 debuts with a mild-hybrid V6 with electric turbochargers.
The new S6 also receives a new eight-speed automatic and Quattro AWD.
Pricing for the new Audi S6 starts just below $74,000. Expect it this fall. 
The previous model Audi S6 came with a monstrous turbocharged V8 engine. That car had 450 tire-shredding horsepower and hit 60 mph in four seconds flat. If the BMW M550i is a sporty luxury car, you can think of the 2020 Audi S6 as a luxury car with sporting apprehensions.
Confused? Don’t be. Yes, there’s a difference between the two. And we’ll get more into that in a bit.
Still, if you’re pining for the A6, I’m betting the 2020 S6 will more than tickle your fancy.
Electrified Turbocharging
The normal A6 comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 with a 48-volt mild hybrid assist system. It produces 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. The engine connects to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic and Quattro all-wheel drive system. It allows the car to register a zero to 60 time of 4.8 seconds.
But for the new S6, Audi needs something to pace with the hot Mercedes-AMG E53 saloon, a car utilizing EQ Boost electrification and an on-board, 48-volt electrical system to produce 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft. of torque. The biggest rival of the new Audi A6 is the hotter BMW M550i, which came with a 4.4-liter, twin-turbo V8 mill with 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft. of torque. And if you really need to know, the M550i has the same engine and power output as the M850i Gran Coupe.
As you can see, the 2020 Audi A6 is facing serious competition.
Audi did the next best thing: load the new S6 with mind-numbing amounts of technology. The new 2.9-liter TFSI V6 is now equipped with electric turbochargers. The turbos draw power from the on-board 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Having electric turbochargers is a good thing. For starters, it doesn’t rely on exhaust pressure to spin wildly, which essentially means zero turbo lag at any engine speed. This also means the turbos can spool up instantaneously and provide an immediate response, according to Audi.
With that being said, the new electrified V6 churns out 444 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. of torque, so you won’t exactly miss the lack of cylinders under the bonnet.
New Eight-Speed Automatic & Quattro AWD
The 2020 Audi S6 now comes with a new eight-speed Tiptronic automatic. The transmission replaces the dual-clutch seven-speed unit in the outgoing model. It also happens to be more capable of matching the low-end torque of the revised V6. Also standard is Audi’s Quattro AWD system with wheel-selective torque control. It delivers 60 percent of the available power to the rear axles, and 40 percent to the front in normal driving. The AWD system can shift as much as 70 percent of available torque to the front or 85 percent to the rear axle in demanding situations.
RELATED

If you want to drive like a lunatic in your Audi S6, don’t forget the available Quattro sport differential. The system splits torque between the left and right rear wheel to enhance cornering agility. If you push hard, it can nearly transfer all torque to one wheel. The optional S Sport Package includes dynamic all-wheel steering, a throatier sports exhaust, and luscious red brake calipers. Throw in some more coin, and you get a sport-tuned suspension with adaptive damping.
Sportier Exterior Design
The new Audi S6 also receives a mild exterior makeover. It has S-model front and rear bumpers, aluminum exterior side mirrors, and a double-slat Singleframe grille in a platinum finish. The car also receives an alu-optic front splitter, a rear diffuser inlay in a black chrome matte finish, and four tailpipes. Standard are 20-inch wheels with summer performance tires. You can opt for larger 21-inch wheels if you live in places with pothole-free roads.
Immaculate Interior
Interior fit and finish is one of Audi’s biggest strengths. The cabin is home to soft-touch plastics, leather, and metal trim. The switchgear clicks and clacks with German precision while the seats are comfortable enough to cradle the driver and passengers on those long and arduous journeys.
The 2020 Audi S6 has sporty seats wrapped in Valcona leather, a heated and multi-functional three-spoke steering wheel (with an S emblem), and stainless-steel door sills with an illuminated S logo. The car also comes standard with MMI navigation, 10.1-inch upper and 8.6-inch lower touchscreen displays, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a full suite of driver assistance features. The Audi Virtual Cockpit with Google Earth integration is standard as well.
2020 Audi S6 Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Audi S6 starts at $73,900 for the Premium Plus trim and $77,800 for the Prestige trim. The new S6 has a lower base price than the BMW M550i xDrive but is more costly than the Mercedes-AMG E53. The S6 is in the middle of the price range since it also ranks between the BMW and Mercedes-Benz in terms of power output.
As it stands, the new Audi S6 is a proper luxury car. It exists in the same realm as the Mercedes-AMG E53, although both have the required muscle to run wild on the Autobahn. However, the BMW M550i is a genuine sports sedan with a luxurious cabin. Want proof? The Beamer has more power than both the Benz and Audi. Enough said.
However, if you prefer the apathetic styling of Audi vehicles, the S6 will make you smile. First deliveries begin near the end of the year.

2019/07/30,2020 Nissan Rogue: A Brief Walk Around,"The Nissan Rogue, that smallish SUV/crossover aimed at the younger market is still here, and still selling well. The Rogue is Nissan’s best-selling vehicle in the U.S. which is kind of surprising at first. But when you look at the thing and realize it starts at only $25,200, and doesn’t balloon too much higher than that, the sales success makes a lot of sense. No, it’s not going to win the Baja 1000 or anything like that, but if you want to get from Point A to B with enough space and capability, it’s hard to overlook. We will spend a few minutes here running through the ins and outs of the 2020 Nissan Rogue.
2020 Nissan Rogue Overview
The 2020 Rogue has a great combination of features for younger, more urban oriented buyers, being compact in overall size yet having plenty of interior room. The Rogue comes in S, SV, and SL, each offered in front-wheel or “Intelligent All-Wheel Drive” (that’s Nissan’s marketing jargon). The 2020 Rogue offers the automaker’s Intelligent Mobility tech that includes Nissan’s ProPILOT Assist and Safety Shield 360 technologies.
ProPILOT Assist is standard on Rogue SL and available on SV, and both Rogue SV and SL trims come with Safety Shield 360. Safety Shield includes Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection, Rear Automatic Braking, Lane Departure Warning, radar-based Blind Spot Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, and High Beam Assist.
Styling & Design
The new Rogue’s exterior has body-color and heated outside mirrors (with available integrated turn signals); a rear spoiler, privacy glass, and roof rails if you have to haul even more stuff. That could also come in very handy for your camping and outdoor types; think carrying kayaks and bikes and such. There is also an available panoramic moonroof for a nice wide view of the outside world for everyone riding inside. The styling for 2020 also includes that Nissan signature “V-Motion” grille and LED daytime running lights. Yes, the grille is a bit overdone, but it sure beats what Lexus is doing in the grille department.
There’s also a handy, motion-activated liftgate standard on SV and SL grades. 17, 18 or 19-inch aluminum alloy wheels are also available.

Interior Treatments
On the inside, the 2020 Rogue tries to offer you a premium look and feel throughout. The steering wheel is D-shaped to ape the look of race cars. There’s a leather-booted, sport-mode shifter, memory for driver’s seat and mirror settings, and even a remote start. All premium features. Every 2020 Rogue, regardless of trim level, has NissanConnect featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, run through a seven-inch touchscreen display. Adding a Navigation package is an option for SV models, while the Rogue SL comes standard with it.

The 2020 Nissan Rogue has tons of flexibility when it comes to dealing with both passengers and cargo. It has the Divide-N-Hide Cargo System, and the standard Rear Door Alert system reminds you if you left something in the rear seat. The Rear Door Alert is designed to be simple and unobtrusive, but can be turned off if you find it neither of those things.
Power & Performance
Irrespective of trim level, all 2020 Nissan Rogue models are powered by a 2.5-liter, four-cylinder engine. The mill puts out 170 horsepower and 175 lb-ft. of torque. Again, nothing you’re going to be setting records with at Bonneville Speed Weeks, but for the everyday it’s not too bad. The plant is mated to an Xtronic transmission with Sport and Eco switches. Fuel economy for front-wheel drive models is 26/33 city/highway and 29 combined. AWD models return 25/32 city/highway and 27 combined. Not that much of a hit for the all-wheel drive option.

2019/07/27,2020 Acura MDX & MDX Sport Hybrid: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2020 Acura MDX cruises into dealerships as of this writing. 
Buyers can choose between a gasoline or hybrid powertrain. 
An available A-Spec package dresses up the new MDX.
Acura’s MDX SUV, that’s the big one with three rows of seats, just arrived in dealers, so now we know if all of Acura’s promises are real or not. Ah, who am I kidding. You know this thing is going to work. It’ll haul a grand volume of people and things, it’ll always start, always run, and won’t cost that much to operate. We will spend a few minutes here running through the ins and outs of the 2020 Acura MDX.
2020 Acura MDX Equipment
The new Acura MDX comes in two flavors: The normal MDX and the Sport Hybrid. The gasoline MDX starts at $45,395, whereas the Sport Hybrid will run you $53,895. An A-Spec sport appearance package is available, and both models come with a vast list of standard features and tech choices. Each have the suite of AcuraWatch safety and driver-assistance technologies. AcuraWatch includes things like collision and road departure mitigation systems, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Lane Keeping Assist among others.
The 2020 MDX comes in three packages: base, Tech, and Advance; each with Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive as an option. Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (often written as “SH-AWD”) puts power to all four corners with a sophisticated torque-vectoring system. Who knows; it might even be fun in certain conditions. SH-AWD increases rear-wheel torque capacity 40 percent versus the prior generation. Up to 70 percent of the available torque can be distributed to the rear wheels; and up to 100 percent of that torque can be distributed to either the right-rear or left-rear wheel.
If you go for the popular A-Spec look-good package, you’ll add a bunch of appearance upgrades inside and out. Your passengers will treated to four-way power lumbar seats, a “walk through” second-row configuration (with the Technology and Entertainment packages), and an exclusive matching wood center console. Our pick is definitely the A Spec. Go with that.
Traditional MDX
The normal MDX features a 3.5-liter i-VTEC 24-valve V6 with direct injection. The plant puts out 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft. of torque with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Nine! (I wonder how many gears we’ll add before someone says uncle?) Front-wheel drive is available if SH-AWD isn’t your thing. Regardless, the “Idle Stop” feature (Acura’s version of start/stop technology) offers a “more refined” driving experience. You can pick from nine colors, including several premium choices.

MDX Sport Hybrid
The 2020 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid differs mainly in the drivetrain arena, being motivated by SH-AWD. The 3.0-liter, i-VTEC V6 pairs with the three-motor SH-AWD system to deliver more direct power and torque. Total system horsepower is an impressive 321 ponies and 289 lb-ft. of torque, yet all MDX Sport Hybrids earn an EPA combined fuel economy of 27 mpg. In the case of the Sport Hybrid, the transmission of choice is seven-speed dual-clutch unit, a close relative of the NSX’s nine-speed DCT.

It’s also worth noting the Hybrid’s electric system operates independently of the gasoline engine as it delivers torque to the rear wheels.
The Technology and Advanced package are available for the 2020 MDX Sport Hybrid. The Tech Package has seating for seven, while the Advance Package seats six with second-row captain’s chairs, and a large second-row center console in place of that three-up bench. The MDX Sport Hybird comes in eight colors, including several premium colors. In other words, there’s a lot there for less than $60,000.
2020 Acura MDX Availability
The new MDX and MDX Sport Hybrid are at dealers now. Acura says the MDX is the best-selling three-row luxury SUV of all time, which is probably true; given that “three row” cuts out a lot of competitors and what counts as “luxury” is debatable. But hey, Acura has been selling more than 50,000 MDX units per year for seven straight years.

2019/07/25,"Chevy Silverado 1500 Duramax Sails Past Rivals, Fuel Economy Announced","The 2020 Chevy Silverado with the 3.0-liter Duramax diesel tops Ford and Ram in fuel economy. 
The in-line six diesel employs an aluminum block and nixes a balancer shaft to reduce weight. 
Expect the new Chevy Silverado with the 3.0-liter Duramax diesel engine later this fall. 
The fuel economy numbers are in, and it’s looking good for the new Chevy Silverado 1500 Duramax. The turbo-diesel engine returns an EPA-estimated 23/33 city/highway in two-wheel drive; 23/29 with four-wheel drive. The figures are a solid win for Chevy in the ongoing truck battle between Detroit’s Big Three. By comparison, the F-150 Power Stroke with two-wheel drive achieves 22/30 city/highway and 20/25 in a 4×4 configuration. The current Ram EcoDiesel comes in at 20/27 city/highway for two-wheelers and 19/27 with four-wheel drive.
“We designed the all-new Silverado and the all-new 3.0-liter Duramax turbo-diesel to deliver both performance and efficiency,” explained Tim Herrick, Silverado Executive Chief Engineer. “The engine utilizes state-of-the-art technologies to optimize every drop of fuel, and takes advantage of architectural changes to make Silverado larger, lighter, and more aerodynamic than before.”
2020 Chevy Silverado 1500 Duramax: Setting The Stage
This new 3.0-liter Duramax is the first diesel since 1997 for a Chevy light-duty truck. It’s also the automaker’s first inline-six configuration for full-size, light duty trucks. With the truck market being so competitive, the challenges of designing a new powertrain are monumental. However, engineers had plenty of experience to fall back on as they worked through the architecture of the new inline-six Duramax.
“We set out to offer light duty truck customers the best of diesel – outstanding fuel economy, great horsepower and responsive torque – plus unexpected levels of refinement,” said Nicola Menarini, Director for diesel truck engine program execution. “We leveraged our global diesel expertise to make sure the all-new 3.0-liter Duramax turbo-diesel engine offers the impressive performance and durability our truck customers demand.”
Under The Hood
Hallmarks of the 3.0-liter Duramax include an aluminum engine block, iron cylinder liners, forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods, and blended silicon/aluminum pistons. Chevy says the on-board thermal management system quickly warms up propulsion components for more efficient operation. In the interest of fuel efficiency, the new Silverado 1500 Duramax employs a driver-selectable stop/start feature. Designers also worked to keep the engine’s operation smooth absent a balancer shaft, something Mark Phelan of the Detroit Free Press noted as a strength during a recent test drive.
“The resulting combination offers all of the performance, refinement, and capability customers want in a full-size truck, with highway fuel efficiency you would expect from a family sedan,” Herrick added.
Related: An inside look at the 2020 Chevy Silverado HD.
Transmission & Towing Specs
Chevy’s 3.0-liter Duramax delivers 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of torque, with max payload coming in at 1,870 lbs. Properly-equipped 4×4 trucks can tow up to 9,300 lbs., a figure Chevy says will suffice for 90 percent of buyers. Power is put to the ground via a Hydra-Matic 10L80 10-speed automatic, complete with a larger overall ratio spread and smaller steps between gears to maximize performance and efficiency. Those using the truck for towing will benefit from the standard diesel exhaust brake and tow-haul mode.

Pricing & Availability
This new Duramax is Chevy’s fourth such diesel, joining the Colorado, Silverado HD, and Silverado Medium Duty. The 3.0-liter Duramax is available on the LT, RST, LTZ, and High Country trims. For LTZ and High Country, the engine is a $2,495 option, same as the 6.2-liter V8. The upgrade for LT and RST trims runs $3,890 more than the standard 2.7-liter turbo engine.
Expect the 2020 Chevy Silverado 1500 with the Duramax diesel this fall.

2019/07/24,Bentley EXP 100 GT Concept: The EV Grand Tourer of 2035,"If you’re a British car maker celebrating 100 years of existence, what do you do? Well, you create a concept car of course! And Bentley did just that with the magnificent EXP 100 GT Concept. According to Bentley, the EXP 100 GT is a big and obvious nod to the future (2035 to be more exact) of luxury grand tourers. Yet more than that, the EXP 100 GT is the physical embodiment of future Bentley vehicles. At the same time, the Bentley EXP 100 GT Concept sets a benchmark for autonomous driving technology, sustainable luxury, and electric mobility.
Bentley EXP 100 GT Concept: Unmistakably A Bentley
Unlike other concepts, the EXP 100 GT is unmistakably a Bentley. The front styling bears much semblance to the original Bentley Blower with round headlights. It also has an illuminated version of the Flying B mascot on the hood. Direct your eyes on those gorgeous rear haunches and you’ll see a striking similarity to the haunches of the Continental GT. But what sets it apart from other Bentleys is the sheer size of the thing.
The Bentley EXP 100 GT Concept is eight feet wide (2.4 meters) and 19 feet long (5.8 meters). In fact, each door is 6.5 feet long and rise as far as nine feet into the air when open. Thankfully, the doors open by swinging upwards in a true futuristic fashion (otherwise just imagine parking it at the mall on the weekend).
Of course, we’re talking about a concept car, so it’s natural to expect some silliness in the mix. For example, the headlights and huge front grille are embedded with matrix wave illumination. They look good to be quite honest, and I sincerely hope this feature makes its way into future automobiles. The dancing lights give the vehicle some much-needed personality, most especially when talking about a full-electric car. Yet, these types of things are hallmarks of the typical concept car.
Electric Powertrain With Mountains of Power
Different from other concepts, like the BMW Vision M Next, the Bentley EXP 100 GT is primarily motivated by electrons. The Vision M Next is a hybrid supercar with a conventional gasoline engine and electric motors. On the other hand, the Bentley EXP 100 GT is full-electric. It comes with an electric motor at each wheel, which effectively means an all-wheel drivetrain and torque vectoring to match.
Even though the EXP 100 GT is quite portly at 4,200 lbs., the powerful electric motors allow it to scoot from zero to 60 mph in under 2.5 seconds. Wow! It seems this concept is theoretically redefining the laws of physics, the more you dive into it. Bentley didn’t say anything about the battery pack, but they did say the batteries are large and dense enough to produce a range of 434 miles (700 kilometers) on a single charge. This also allows the motors to pump out a mind-numbing 1,106 lb-ft. of torque.

No wonder it accelerates like a mega-buck hypercar!

The Right Kind of Autonomous Driving Technology
What really makes the Bentley EXP 100 GT more enticing (apart from the bite-your-knuckles styling) is the autonomous driving technology. Similar to the BMW Vision M Next, it seems the boffins at Crewe share the same opinion when it comes to autonomous cars. The Bentley EXP 100 GT is an autonomous car driven by advanced artificial intelligence or A.I., but we’ll talk more about that in a moment. The brilliant part is the ability to transfer control to the driver when desired.
We said it before, but want to say it again just to be clear: we’re not objecting to autonomous cars, but we don’t want to lose the ability to drive because we love driving our cars. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the future of autonomous driving. Thank you Bentley and BMW, who has a similar mindset with the Vision M Next.
Bentley Personal Assistant A.I.
Let’s talk more about the A.I. in the Bentley EXP 100 GT. Bentley calls it the Personal Assistant, and the idea is to interact with the A.I. using voice control and hand gestures. The latter happens when you make hand gestures to the front or rear of those Cumbria Crystal surfaces.
You can think of the A.I. as the see-all and do-all system in the car. The A.I. can automatically engage five different driving modes, or you can choose to pick which one. My favorite is Enhance and Cocoon. The former literally harvests the lights, sounds, smells, and air quality from the outside environment, even with the roof up. The latter sort of creates a protective space by turning the glass areas opaque and activating the air purification system. As if that’s not enough, the system can track your eye and head movements. It can even monitor your blood pressure.
Bentley says the vents will “undulate” as they blow clean air inside the cabin, making it look like the car is actually breathing and alive. The system also monitors the CO2 levels inside the cabin and makes the necessary adjustments to ensure occupants have fresh, clean air. The system can even blow scented air for a whiff of sandalwood and moss. The fragrances were created in collaboration with the fragrance house 12.29.
Sustainable Luxury Trim
The Bentley EXP 100 GT may look all high-tech, but it’s constructed using clean and sustainable materials. The Bridge of Weir leather materials are from Scotland and are selected from locally-sourced cowhides. The seats are covered in a 100 percent, bio-based leather derived from the byproducts of winemaking. The car also features Copper Infused Redwood from naturally fallen trees. Bentley sought the expertise of London-based embroidery company Hand and Lock to create different materials for the door panels. Hand and Lock’s designs date back to 1767 and are used on Royal and Military Dress uniforms.

The Future of Bentley Grand Tourers
From the looks alone, it’s safe to assume the future of Bentley grand tourers is solid given the EXP 100 GT Concept. It’s still in concept form, so the exaggeration is very much evident in the design and trim. One example is the tires. Manufactured by Pirelli, the rubber can transform the contact patch and tread pattern to suit varying terrain. But if future Bentley automobiles will bear any semblance to the EXP 100 GT Concept, I’m all in.

2019/07/23,“Old Crow” Mustang GT Takes Off At “The Gathering”,"Ford and Roush Performance team for the “Old Crow” Mustang GT to salute military veterans. 
“Old Crow” takes its inspiration from the P-51 Mustang which saw combat during World War II.
The special Mustang hits the auction block during the 2019 AirVenture show in Wisconsin this week.
A custom Mustang GT, inspired by a P-51 Mustang fighter flown by triple ace Col. Bud Anderson of the U.S. Army Air Force, is about to hit the road. Ford and Roush Performance are behind this special Mustang GT, nicknamed “Old Crow.” The special Mustang was built to mark the 75th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy. It’s just like Anderson’s P-51 Mustang (minus the six 50 cals): Good-looking, fast, and wonderfully overpowered.
One Crazy Ace
We better get this out of the way right now: Jack Roush is kinda nuts, especially when it comes to airplanes. He has had, what, two bad crashes, maybe three, as I recall. One of those should have killed him outright when he boomed into the middle of a lake, except one of the people living on the lake saw him and went out and rescued him. So, given Jack’s love of Fords, excessively powerful engines and planes (in that order), doing up a version of the latest Mustang, like a famous Mustang from World War II, makes complete sense.
Roush is also a longtime friend of Anderson’s.
The “Old Crow” Mustang GT Takes Flight
The one-of-a-kind Mustang (sadly, it will not even be a limited production model) will be auctioned at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s 2019 AirVenture show on Thursday July 25th in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. You do know about Oshkosh? Well, just in case you don’t, the one word answer is GO! You really have to check it out. It’s like Goodwood combined with Pebble Beach, combined with the vintage races at Laguna Seca, only for airplanes. They call it “The Gathering” and it’s the perfect venue for the “Old Crow” Mustang GT.
“This year’s design is especially fitting for the 75-year commemoration of D-Day and the special place we reserve for heroes like Col. Anderson and countless others who demonstrated unparalleled valor and sacrifice,” said Craig Metros, Ford Design Director. “It’s an annual highlight for many on the Ford design team to pay homage to our war heroes by creating a custom tribute vehicle to support the next generation of aviators.”
Auction proceeds benefit the Experimental Aircraft Association’s Aviation Foundation, which encourages younger and aspiring pilots.
“Old Crow” Mustang GT: Power & Performance Specs
The “Old Crow” Mustang GT features a custom paint scheme and badging, replicating Col. Anderson’s iconic P-51 Mustang fighter plane. A Roush custom grille with a P-51 Mustang badge graces the front; the words “Old Crow” are painted on the hood, and a nice Eighth Air Force emblem adorns the decklid panel. Like the P-51 it emulates, the “Old Crow” Mustang GT is all about power and performance, thanks to a Ford and Roush Performance TVS R2650 supercharger. This helps to squeeze 710 horsepower and 610 lb-ft. of torque from the 5.0-liter V8 engine. There’s also a cold air induction system and X pipe from Roush Performance, plus a custom active exhaust system from Ford Performance.

The chassis gets a going over (thankfully) with Ford’s MagneRide damping system. All of that considerable horsepower and torque gets to the ground through a set of custom, 20-inch Roush wheels and 275/35R Continental ExtremeContact sport tires. In keeping with its namesake, aerodynamics were at the top of the list. There are Roush rear fascia aerofoils, a Ford Performance front racing spoiler; a rear spoiler from the 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500, slick custom heat extractors on the hood, and blue rainbow-tinted exhaust tips that emulate the P-51’s exhaust.
On the inside, “Old Crow” is far from the Spartan war machine of 70 plus years ago. It’s fully customized with an aircraft-inspired interior, featuring military-themed green leather and canvas along with a red shifter and door handles. “P-51” adorns the passenger-side dashboard. “Old Crow” even includes a Sparco four-point harness, as well as the nice performance touch of the aluminum rear seat-delete.
In Person & How To Bid
The “Old Crow” Mustang GT will be on display during the AirVenture show from now until the 18th. AirVenture attracts more than 600,000 aviation enthusiasts (e.g. propeller-heads) to Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh, Wisconsin every year. That’s more than Woodstock, more than The Indy 500. Like I said, it’s a big deal. Those who wish to bid on “Old Crow” can call 920-426-6573, or email: gathering@EAA.org.
Also, in case you don’t know who Col. Bud Anderson is; he shot down more than 16 planes in Europe during World War II, flew 116 combat missions, including a six-hour mission on D-Day, was never hit by enemy fire (not even once) nor was he ever forced to withdraw from an aerial engagement. This added up to more than 25 decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star, and Air Medal. Oh, and he was best friends with Chuck Yeager.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Right Stuff once described him as “the best pilot I ever saw.”

2019/07/20,"2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray: Finally, The Mid-Engine Vette ","The 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray is the first mid-engine Vette in history. 
With an LT2 Small Block V8, the new Stingray is the fastest entry-level Vette ever. 
Prior to its on-sale date, the performance car will embark on a cross-country tour. 
Yes, you did just feel that. That was the automotive world shifting on its axis. Chevy just dropped the Corvette for 2020, and normally an all-new Vette is a big deal, but this new Corvette, the C8, is a revolution that has been a long time coming. Nearly 60 years, as a matter of fact. In the late 50s, engineers figured out that, from a performance standpoint, the best place to put the engine is right in the middle. This eventually made its way into production sports cars and today, everyone from Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Porsche, and even boutique makers like Koenigsegg know that if you’re going to go fast, you have to put the engine in the middle.
Everyone, that is, except for Chevrolet.
2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray: Finally, The Mid-Engine Vette
Up until a few days ago, the top of Chevy’s performance mountain, the Corvette, maintained a staunchly old school layout of front engine/rear drive. Many puzzled as to why this is, and even more criticized GM for sticking with this route. As good as the C7 is – and make no mistake, it is a very, very good car with world-topping performance – it was still behind the potential performance curve.
GM has been teasing us with a mid-engine Corvette since 1971. There have been design studies, show cars, production what-ifs, the lot. Some in silver, some in blue; there was even a triple rotor, Wankle-powered mid-engine Vette that was going to be produced “next year.” Or perhaps the year after that. For sure. But it never happened.
Some chalked this up to GM’s inherent corporate conservatism. I was one of them. For as good as the Corvette got, it was, for a long time, not a Serious Sports Car. There were too many compromises and they went on for far too long. For decades it was a car that looked fast, but was hamstrung by design compromises. GM’s time off the line with their flagship was second tier, sometimes even third tier when stacked against the competition.
“If GM was serious about performance,” said all the gearheads and railbirds, “they’d make it mid-engine.” And now, for whatever the reasons, GM has finally heard our pleas and taken the wraps off the eighth generation Corvette for 2020. If the numbers hold, GM will not be in the top tier of performance supercars, they will hold the top spot. The main factors concerning the mid-engine C8 are the engine, the transmission, where everything sits and, very happily, the price.

Power & Performance: No Manual For The Next Generation
At the heart of the 2020 Stingray is Chevy’s next-gen, 6.2-liter Small Block LT2 V8. It’s naturally aspirated and will produce 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft. of torque. Healthy numbers, to be sure, and, indeed, the most horsepower and torque for any entry-level Corvette. Yet, that’s the bottom of the performance ladder. It goes up from there.
Next, the gearbox. The new LT2 plant is mated with Chevy’s first eight speed dual-clutch transmission. Yes, just like the ones you find in Ferraris and Porsches and, more importantly, race cars. There will be no manual option, except by means of steering wheel paddles. The transmission was designed in-house by GM and TREMEC and is unique to the 2020 Stingray. Chevy says the 2020 Corvette Stingray will hit 60 in less than three seconds with skidpad figures coming in over 1.0 Gs.
Less Is More
No, that does not exactly blow Ferrari et al. away, but the C8 is effectively tied for first, if not outright leading. But here’s the number that does obliterate the competition: $60,000. That is the starting price. It is about half what a Porsche 911 goes for. It is about 75 percent less than a Ferrari 488. Do the thought experiment: you have $60,000. Do you put a down payment on a Porsche or a Ferrari, or do you want an entire car? A car that can be serviced in any one of five thousand dealerships.
A car that, and I’ll guarantee this, will have a blazing hot heater and an ice cold AC system.
Say what you want about the Germans and the Italians; and the Japanese and the British and what they are capable of doing, but Chevy just did the same thing, And they did it for the price of a luxury crossover. Everyone else in the world might be able to keep up with, or beat the C8 Stingray on a strip or road course or on a mountain road (maybe); but I seriously, seriously doubt anyone in the world will beat it on price.
Corvette Visualizer
The 2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray goes into production at Bowling Green Assembly later this year. Additional pricing and packaging information will be available closer to launch. When it hits the market, the new Stingray will come in 12 exterior colors, six interior color themes and seat belt colors, and two optional stitching packages. If you simply cannot wait, a new digital tool, the Corvette Visualizer, lets you design your dream mid-engine Vette in vivid detail.

2019/07/19,Lotus Evija: Great Britain’s Beauty Takes Charge of EV World,"The Lotus Evija is the automaker’s first electric hypercar, and the first from Great Britain.
With aggressive performance targets, the Evija would be the most powerful production car.
Developed in concert with Williams Advanced Engineering, only 130 examples will be made. 
If – and that is a very big if – Lotus is right about their numbers concerning their just-announced Evija electric hypercar, then Porsche can prepare to see their Taycan get blown so far off the track a bloodhound couldn’t find it. And forget about Tesla, the Lotus Evija could make them look like a bunch of pikers. Now, like I said, that’s a big if. And, to me, that’s one of the EV world’s biggest problems: this constant fudging about figures. It seems like every number on an EV spec sheet has an asterisk by it. That said, even if Lotus’ figures are off by a whopping 10 percent, the Evija will still be one of the best performing cars on the planet, let alone against the EV competition.
Lotus Evija: Power & Performance
The Evija’s four-wheel drive powertrain is slated to produce 2,000 PS or 1,972 horsepower, making it the most powerful production car in the world. Torque is 1,700 Nm (or 1,254 lb-ft.) with full torque vectoring (via four e-motors) for phenomenal handling. Power is produced by a 2,000 kW lithium-ion battery, mounted amidships. All up weight is 1,680 kg, around 3,700 lbs. Yes, that’s heavy for a Lotus, but light for an EV, especially with those power figures. And by these figures, the Lotus Evija has more power at each wheel than the total power of any other Lotus road car. Ever.
The performance figures add up to some impressive numbers: zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) in under three seconds; zero to 300 km/h (186 mph) in under nine seconds, and a top speed in excess of 200 mph. Put it this way: Count to three, you’re doing freeway speed; count to ten and you’re going faster than a fully-loaded 747 at takeoff. All this in about the time it takes a Camry Hybrid to hit 60.
Although we’re not through yet.
Flat-Out Power
Total range is 250 miles, and Lotus says power can be delivered over a sustained period of time. That’s a polite and British way of saying you won’t have to pussyfoot around at 32 mph most of the time to get that kind of mileage. Thanks to the car’s advanced aerodynamics and four-radiator cooling package for the battery, the Evija can be driven flat-out with no loss in power for at least seven minutes in Track mode.
RELATED
Audi's Super Bowl 2020 Ad Featuring the e-tron Sportback
Let’s put that into perspective. You can drive the Lotus Evija flat out for the amount of time it takes to lap the Nürburgring. In other words, the Evija will be the first EV that can compete directly with internal combustion cars over the same track. None of this BS 100 yard dashes and drag strip time trials.
Charging Units
“But who cares if it’s going to take me all night to charge it.” you retort. My response is don’t worry. Lotus, it seems, saved the Evija’s most impressive figure for last: Thanks to the partnership with Williams Advanced Engineering (yes, the Grand Prix team), the battery can accept a massive 800 kW charge. That’s more than twice the current industry maximum. Using existing charging technology, like a 350 kW unit, the Evija’s charge time will be 12 minutes to 80 percent, and 18 minutes to 100 percent. Compare that to how long it takes to fill up a normal EV now.
But it just gets better from there with the Lotus Evija.
Using Lotus’ 800 kW charger (which they haven’t unveiled yet) it will be possible to fully replenish the battery in just nine minutes. In other words, you can get a full charge with the normal equipment faster than you can eat lunch. With the high-power factory juicer, you can fill up the “tank” of your Evija in less than a coffee break. Lotus says they are talking with suppliers on additional charging solutions for customers.
Related: An in-depth look and technical overview of the Lotus Evija.
Pricing & Availability
The bad news, such as it is, comes down to the fact Lotus will produce only 130 Evijas, not coincidentally because this is Lotus’ 130th design, counting the Grand Prix and sports racers. So get in line now because the order books are open. Have that checkbook at the ready, because a £250,000 deposit secures a production slot (that’s around $300,000). The list price will be £1.7m plus taxes or around 1.9 million USD. For that handsome sum, Lotus will let you configure your Evija exactly as you want, down to the smallest details.
Oh, and in case you’re wondering, Evija is pronounced ‘E-vi-ya’ and means the first in existence or the living one. This carries on the Lotus tradition of naming cars that start with E – Elan, Elise, Esprit, Evora and so on.

CROZZ will debut early next year. By 2021, a smaller SUV will slot beneath the Tiguan. Company leaders say VW’s latest EV platform will give them the flexibility to better adapt to a changing market.
“SUVs have definitely assumed the mantle of family haulers from the station wagons and minivans we remember from our childhoods,” explained Scott Keogh, President and CEO, Volkswagen of America, Inc. “But as we look towards the future, both our expanded SUV lineup and the upcoming ID. family of electric vehicles will bring the opportunity to combine the style and space people want in a variety of ways. As the ID. BUZZ concept demonstrates, the flexibility of our EV platform gives us the ability to revive body styles of the past, so anything is possible.”

2019/07/17,2020 Subaru Outback: A Brief Look At The Trim Levels & Pricing,"Good news for people who live in the northern tier of states; or if you live somewhere with unpredictable weather that can turn bad real quick; or if you’re just a rally fan: the 2020 Subaru Outback is here. Like Subarus from times past, the 2020 Outback is loaded with safety and convenience features; is reliable as a Japanese car firm can make it and, best of all, has an all-wheel drive system to get you through bad weather, bad terrain, and bad conditions.
Here is a brief look at everything you need to know about the 2020 Subaru Outback.
How Much Does The 2020 Subaru Outback Cost?
For 2020, Subaru’s Outback starts around $27,000, going all the way up to just under $40,000 if you throw the option book at it. Yes, that does get quite high, but when you slather on all the goodies, it makes for a very reasonably-priced, fully-kitted out SUV, which is what an Outback wagon essentially is. Trim levels include Base, Premium, Limited, Touring, Onyx Edition XT, Limited XT, and Touring XT.
How Is The 2020 Subaru Outback Equipped?
The 2020 Subaru Outback comes standard with Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, Active Torque Vectoring, Vehicle Dynamics Control, and X-MODE with Hill Descent Control. It also boasts 8.7 inches of ground clearance, a lot for what is essentially a wagon. That’s also a healthy amount when confronting things like ruts and snow drifts and such. All 2020 Subaru Outbacks feature EyeSight Driver Assist Technology with Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Centering Function. Roof rails with tie down points and crossbars are standard across the lineup.
On the inside, a tablet-style, 11.6-inch display runs all of your connectivity and multimedia, including the new Wi-Fi hotspot (an Outback first).
The best “new” news for 2020 is the return of a turbo engine to the Outback lineup. Standard on XT models, the 2.4-liter turbo Boxer engine delivers 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft. of torque. It’s paired with a Lineartronic CVT with eight-speed manual control via steering wheel paddle shifters.
Outback Base
The entry level Outback has a starting price of $26,645, a bump of only $300 from the 2019 model. Nice! Base trim gets you Subaru’s Starlink multimedia system with an upper seven-inch touchscreen for audio controls, and a lower seven-inch screen for climate controls and other systems. The Base trim includes AM/FM/HD Radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, SiriusXM, Travel Link, and Clari-Fi music restoration. Power on the base model comes from a new version of the 2.5-liter Boxer engine that puts out 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft. of torque.

Auto Start-Stop is also standard and helps you get an EPA-estimated 26/33 city/highway mpg.
Outback Premium
The next rung up is occupied by the Outback Premium and will set you back $28,895. The Premium adds the All-Weather Package of heated front seats and exterior mirrors and windshield wiper de-icer. Premium Outbacks have LED fog lights, dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10-way power driver’s seat (with power lumbar), leather-wrapped steering wheel, and silver or ivory stitching on the dash. The front windows are auto-up/auto-down; the cargo cover is single-touch lifting, and there are 2.1A USB ports in the rear center console.
The Outback Premium comes standard with an 11.6-inch touchscreen; Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Bluetooth streaming are each standard on the premium trim as well. Like the Base, the Premium receives an AM/FM/HD stereo, SiriusXM, and Travel Link. An additional safety package includes Blind-Spot Detection, Lane Change Assist, and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert. Another package adds a power moonroof and navigation.
Outback Limited
Above Premium is the Outback Limited, starting at $33,445. The Limited ups the ante with perforated leather-trimmed upholstery, gloss black and silver metallic interior trim, and 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels. A 10-way power driver’s seat with two-position memory is standard, as is the eight-way power passenger seat and hands-free rear gate. Rear passengers receive both heated seats and air conditioner outlets.
The Limited trim also adds Reverse Automatic Braking and push-button start. An available package adds navigation, a power moonroof, heated steering wheel, and a distraction mitigation system.

Outback Touring
The Outback Touring tops out at $37,345 (without getting into add-on packages). Distinguished by chrome pillar trim and door handle inserts, the Touring also sports a satin chrome finish for the exterior mirrors, while the roof rails, tie-down points, and cross bars receive a special silver finish. The interior features Java Brown Nappa leather with tan stitching. Ventilated front seats, power moonroof, heated steering wheel, navigation, and the distraction mitigation system are all standard.
Onyx Edition XT
New for 2020, this is your flashy, show off option. The Onyx Edition XT has 18-inch alloy wheels, black-finish badging, and a gray two-tone interior. Many of the features listed above from the other models are standard on the Onyx Edition XT.
2020 Subaru Outback: Availability & Manufacturing
Other option packages are available that allow you to somewhat mix and match features, but the basic packages within the Outback models will have 99 percent of buyers covered. The 2020 Subaru Outback is manufactured at Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA) in Lafayette, Indiana. Expect them at Subaru dealers this fall.

2019/07/16,Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO: A Quick Look At This Track-Ready Machine,"So, remember when Mercedes teased us with their plans to produce a super-duper, all-out, take-no-prisoners version of their Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO? Yeah, me too. And then they went and told us 90 percent of everything except how much it would cost? Yeah, me too on that one as well. Looks like Merc & AMG have finally coughed up the cost, and . . . you know, it’s not all that bad.
Well, relatively speaking it’s not all that bad.
What Is The Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO?
The Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO is not some ne plus ultra hypercar like a La Ferrari or a Porsche 918 or Aston Martin’s Valkyrie. That will come later. What’s here now is more of a Porsche GT3 fighter and, comparatively speaking, the price is not all that bad at 200 large! Or $199,650 to be precise. And like I said, right in the market range of hot Porsches, Ferrari V8s, and big bore Astons.
What do you get for the price of a starter condo in the burbs? More of some things and less of others.
Power & Performance
You get an AMG 4.0-liter V8 bi-turbo plant that puts out a worthy 577 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. of torque. The hand-built engine is mated to an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT seven-speed transmission. Together with all the latest tweaks and tunes, this engine hauls you to 60 in 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 198. Other unique performance and design highlights include the AMG RIDE CONTROL coil-over suspension with manual damping adjustment. This allows you to more precisely tune the spring rates, rebound, and compression. Further fine-tuning is available via adjustment wheels on the shocks themselves to suit specific tracks or personal preference.
Carbon Fiber Galore
The carbon fiber front splitter has aluminum supports and is bigger than before. Additional aerodynamic carbon fiber dive planes or “flics” are located on the front bumper. There are functional aerodynamic “gills” in the front fenders and a trick, adjustable carbon fiber front sway bar. All of these bits add up for better front-axle downforce, according to Mercedes-AMG.
The carbon fiber roof is newly redesigned and features a lower center section; there’s a matte carbon fiber crossbar and interior trim, carbon fiber side skirt inserts, and a carbon fiber rear diffuser. The new Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO comes with carbon ceramic brakes, carbon fiber side mirror housings, and a fixed rear spoiler in, surprise, carbon fiber. There’s more carbon fiber on this thing than in a crate of No. 2 pencils.

Styling & Interior Treatments
Styling cues include color-coordinated, race-inspired accent stripes found only on the Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO. If you choose the Selenite Grey Magno exterior you get Gloss Light Green stripes. All other exterior colors receive Matte Dark Grey stripes. If you’re not that flashy, the accent stripes can be omitted.
For the 2020 AMG GT in general, updates include a new diffuser insert, double-round tailpipe design, and signature LED headlights. Interior updates include the standard 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a larger 10.25-inch multimedia display. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, while the steering wheel integrates touch control buttons for the instrument cluster and multimedia displays.
There’s a standard rear-view and front camera to help with parking.
Pricing & Availability
Like I said above, pricing for the Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO starts at $199,650, but the real bad news is that Mercedes will only make 750 units globally. But, if you’ve got the mean green and can get in line, you’ll get a car that features an adjustable coil-over suspension, lightweight construction with carbon fiber components all over the place, and functional aerodynamic enhancements that return a Nürburgring time of 7.04.632 minutes. Which is fast.
If they are not all spoken for ahead of time, expect the Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO in dealers later this year.

2019/07/15,BMW Vision M Next: This Concept Redefines The Autonomous Car,"A new BMW concept shows how self-driving cars from the brand might look in time. 
With a turbocharged and hybrid powertrain, the Vision M Next hits 60 in three seconds.
For now, the Vision M Next is only a concept but it does make our imagination run wild.  
Admittedly, there are many delicious elements in the BMW Vision M Next concept. For one thing, just look at it! It’s a stylish reinterpretation of past and present BMW vehicles. To be more specific, it’s like the lovechild of a 1972 BMW E25 Turbo Concept and i8 PHEV. The wedge-like design is also a fitting ode to the E26 BMW M1. The ’70s and ’80s are back, and I’m loving it!
However, the one thing that really stands out in the Vision M Next is BMW’s ideas on autonomous driving.
The BMW Vision M Next is an autonomous car, yes. But it’s the type of autonomy where the controls can be overridden by the driver. In short, it’s a concept car worth waiting for and something traditional car lovers can sink their teeth into.
BMW Vision M Next: The Brand’s Future?
The German manufacturer says all future BMW vehicles will be built utilizing the D+ACES philosophy. This means Design, Autonomous Driving, Electrification, and Services are carefully blended to produce the ultimate driving machine of the future. “The BMW Vision M Next provides a glimpse into the future of sporty driving,” says Adrian Van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President of BMW Group Design. “It demonstrates how state-of-the-art technology can also make the experience of driving yourself purer and more emotionally engaging.”
It’s no secret things are shaking up at BMW HQ. The company is now struggling to cope with the onset of fully-electric vehicles like the Tesla Model S and Model X. And I find this unsettling considering BMW was among the first to sell an EV in the form of the i3 in 2013. It seems upper management underestimated the potential of full EVs, and they’re now playing catch up. Turning up last is not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, you can use it your own advantage. And if the BMW Vision M Next is any indication, it’s safe to say gearheads, car lovers, and auto enthusiasts can look forward to a bright and enjoyable future.
The Good Kind of Hybrid Power
We already established the BMW Vision M Next is a looker. It has all the elements of a poster car: a retro-delectable, wedge-shaped silhouette, gullwing doors, ridiculous color schemes, and illuminated elements on the kidney grille. The blade-shaped triangular elements on the air intakes remind me of the snout of a Lamborghini Aventador. In short, the BMW Vision M Next is every inch a supercar. But what makes a car super in the purest sense of the word is vast reserves of power. In this regard, the BMW Vision M Next has you covered.
RELATED
Automakers Respond To Coronavirus
It’s actually a hybrid supercar, but it’s the good kind of hybrid power. The car has a turbo four-cylinder motor and an array of electric motors. BMW didn’t say how many, but with the capability to engage electric all-wheel drive or pure rear-wheel drive, we assume it has no less than two or three electric motors. All told, you have 600 horsepower at your disposal, good for a top speed of 186 mph (300 km/h).
And I mean, wow! I personally don’t like hybrids. I think they’re clunky, too complicated, and extremely dull on the road. But if a hybrid has 600 horsepower and can go from zero to 60 mph in three seconds, I wouldn’t mind having one, most especially if it looks exactly like the BMW Vision M Next.
In the future, what if you have to pass by certain zero-emissions zones? No problem. The Vision M Next has an all-electric range of 62 miles (100 km), which frankly is not enough. However, 62 miles is mostly enough for quick city jaunts, so maybe this isn’t bad at all.
EASE & BOOST Mode
Remember the part about the BMW Vision M Next being an autonomous car? You can engage full-autonomy in EASE mode. Meanwhile, if you want to drive it like how a BMW should be driven, BOOST mode is the way to go.
Easy, right? You can read the newspaper, upload a selfie, or chat with fellow passengers in EASE mode, all while traveling at speed. But if you want to drive, BOOST mode will place you at the helm. This all sounds amazing: being able to enjoy both autonomy and actual driving. I sincerely hope other car makers are looking to what BMW is doing in the Vision M Next. If manufacturers want full autonomy to become a reality, it’s important to give consumers an option on whether or not to drive. We want autonomous cars, but we want to choose when it should do so.

Boost Pod: The Beauty of Simplicity
The ultra-minimalist interior in the BMW Vision M Next is a triumph in modern design. The most striking feature is the accent line in the driver’s area. It runs forward from the seat over to the steering wheel. This represents the ideal line of sight as you drive, which speaks highly of BMW’s performance intent.
You’ll find hi-tech woven synthetic fibers, anodized titanium, and painted surfaces in the cabin. Surprisingly, leather is only found in the hand touch points of the steering wheel and door pull handles. The visible roof structure is crafted from recycled carbon fiber while the headliner has a tone-in-tone paint finish.

The highlight of the interior is the Boost Pod, which is BMW future-speak for the Speed Racer-inspired steering wheel and instrument console. Instead of traditional dials or large display screens, all the driving information is projected to an array of glass panels behind the steering wheel. It’s basically like a visor that projects information.
Thrilling Soundtrack
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: electric cars are too quiet for their own good. But BMW – who happens to be late in the EV game – has come up with something brilliant. The BMW Vision M Next has its own musical soundtrack penned by no less than Hans Zimmer. The man won an Academy Award for Best Original Musical Score for the movie Lion King in 1995 and has composed music for more than 150 Hollywood films.
It’s safe to assume BMW hired the right man for the job.
Conventional EVs, like the BMW i3, have exterior speakers to alert pedestrians. This is good, but it does nothing to liven up the driving experience. With its own dedicated soundtrack, the BMW Vision M Next won’t end up sounding like a brash muscle car, but at least it won’t sound like an appliance either.
Welcome To The Future
And it’s time to come back to Earth. Sadly, the BMW Vision M Next is just a concept. Yet it shows BMW is moving in the right direction. With that being said, I propose a toast to other car makers taking notice of what the future of driving should really be about. Cheers to the future, lads!

2019/07/13,2020 Dodge Charger: When The Widebody Comes To Town,"Given already to the Dodge Challenger, the Charger now receives the brand’s Widebody treatments. 
More than just looks, the Charger Widebody boasts a number of performance and tech upgrades.
Pricing has not been announced for the new muscle cars, although the order books open this fall. 
You can’t say Mopar is inconsistent. Essentially the philosophy of Dodge in the modern era – any time post-1960 or so – is simple: What’s the biggest, highest horsepower engine we got? Put it in everything! Whatever vehicles the company is producing, said engines will eventually make it into everything. For example, the Dodge Durango SRT. With the bigger engines, come bigger cars, like the Challenger’s Widebody treatments two years ago. And now here we are with the 2020 Dodge Charger getting a Widebody upgrade of its own.
Here Is The. Point.
Thus spoke Zarathustra: “Designed and Engineered to Push the Boundaries of What a Four-door Family Sedan Can Be, the New 2020 Dodge Charger … ” Yeah, blah, blah, blah, here’s the deal: Supercharged, 6.2 Hemi Hellcat V8, 707 horsepower, 650 lb-ft. of torque. Sure, sure, you can argue “But the BMW M5 this!” or “The AMG that!” or whatever you want, but I’ll see you at the end of The Strip, Klaus. No, not by a country mile is the Dodge Charger as refined, or as good all-around, as those built by Germans (and a good slice of Japanese or the British), but to FCA’s way of thinking, that’s kind of beside the point.
The Point here was one they figured out back when Brian Jones was leaving The Stones. The Point is quarter mile performance is everything. Acceleration. Torque. Tire-smoking, explosive, head-snapping, retina-detaching acceleration. So we’re not going to talk about nav systems and infotainment packages and leather dye colors. That stuff is beside The Point.
2020 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody
The Widebody package is standard on Charger SRT Hellcat and available for the Charger Scat Pack. If you get the Widebody, which you should, the fender flares add 3.5 inches of width. Dodge says this makes for “an even more aggressive, planted stance.” Gee, ya think? At any rate, thanks to the humongoid flares, you have lots of room for the wider, 20 by 11-inch wheels wrapped in Pirelli 305/35ZR20 tires. Sure, you might think that’s kind of overkill, but I direct your attention back to that torque figure of 650 lb-ft.
Also, those big wheels give you plenty of room for stuff like the Brembo two-piece front brake rotors (15.4 inches) with six-piston calipers. Stopping distance is now four feet shorter (107 feet) from 60 to 0 mph (and you’re going to need that, let’s face it). The 6.2 supercharged Hemi and TorqueFlite 8HP90 eight-speed automatic send the Hellcat Widebody to a top speed of 196 mph. 60 mph comes up in just 3.6 seconds with a quarter-mile time of 10.96 seconds. In case you are interested, the new Charger Hellcat Widebody pulls .96 g on the skidpad.
RELATED

Naturally the Widebody’s suspension gets special tuning all around. Front spring rates increase to provide a jump in stiffness of 32 percent, versus the existing Charger Hellcat. Larger sway bars enter the picture, expanding from 32 mm to 34 mm in front and from 19 mm to 22 mm out back. An SRT-tuned, Bilstein three-mode adaptive suspension and a new electric power steering system are also on deck.
Hellcat Widebody Performance Tech
On top of all this, there are four race-inspired tech goodies standard for 2020. Race Cooldown keeps cooling the supercharger/charge air cooler after the engine is shut off so things don’t overcook. Line Lock, an old school personal favorite, engages only the front brakes so you can do burnouts. Launch Control handles tire slip for more consistent straight-line acceleration. (To me, this is cheating, but that’s another story.) And then Launch Assist, via the wheel speed sensors, modifies torque (in milliseconds) to prevent driveline-damaging wheel hop during launch.

2020 Dodge Charger Scat Pack Widebody
Now with the 2020 Dodge Charger Scat Pack Widebody – which might be your best choice in a performance versus cost equation – you get the 6.4 392 Hemi, which puts out 485 horsepower. The engine is mated to a TorqueFlite 8HP70 eight-speed automatic. All the aforementioned suspension bits and performance-enhancing mistresses; including Launch Control, Launch Assist, and Line Lock – all of it is still there with the Scat Pack Widebody.
Versus the “normal” Scat Pack, the Widebody stops three feet shorter. Acceleration improves too, with the Widebody Scat Pack hitting 60 mph in 4.3 seconds, the quarter-mile in 12.4 seconds at 111 mph, and a .98 g lateral grip figure on the skidpad. The Widebody Scat Pack also runs 1.3 seconds faster on a 2.1-mile road course, equal to eight car lengths per lap.
Standard wheels are these 20 by 11-inch, split-five spoke deals with a low-gloss granite finish. Optional are the 20-inchers in Carbon Black. Pirelli 305/35ZR20 all-season performance tires are standard; three-season tires are optional.
Ordering & Availability
So look, you’ve got a family, you need a sedan, you might (might!) want to consider the Charger. With the Widebody Scat Pack. Or the Hellcat if you are a greased-stained gearhead with only a partial amount of sanity like myself. The order books for the Widebody Chargers open this fall, with deliveries expected early next year.

2019/07/10,Ford Super Duty Tremor Off-Road Package: Bring On The Heavy Equipment,"When you don’t exactly need a Raptor but still want to be a total boss off-road.
Perhaps a Super Duty with a Tremor Off-Road Package will fancy your tastes?
From 35-inch tires to custom drive modes, this new Super Duty is the real deal.
Is this a case of Ford splitting the difference? This being the Tremor Off-Road Package for the 2020 Ford Super Duty. And splitting the difference means, perhaps, that rather than having to buy a big, fire-breathing Raptor or nothing at all, you could get an F-Series Super Duty for 2020 and add on a whole bunch of sweet off-road bits. Sounds like a plan. Hence the Tremor Off-Road Package, a serious hardware and tech upgrade for those who want to take their big new Ford Super Duty off the beaten path.
Bigger Shocks + Bigger Tires = Happy People
Now, a while back, Ford made this big off-road special called the Raptor. People loved it. And by people, I mean ink-stained wretches like myself. That crowd wants to play in the mud and dirt with their 4X4 toys, but there are some who like to customize things further. Why? Because they’re a fickle lot and like to pick and choose, a la cart, what gear goes into their rigs, rather than getting the whole deal from the factory.
And FoMoCo also realizes this goes the other way. What if you’re a truck person most of the time and an off-roader some of the time. Doesn’t make sense to have some near-Baja 1000 special if you only hit the out yonder once every so often. Or, as Todd Eckert, Ford Truck Group Marketing Manager put it; “A growing number of Super Duty customers use their trucks for more than work. They’re fishing, camping and towing boats on weekends, and they go off-road, so we designed this truck specifically for them.” What that translates to is, in short, more ground clearance, bigger shocks, bigger tires, and more off-road capability.
Ford says it’s the most capable off-road Super Duty ever, but they would say that.
What Is The Tremor Off-Road Package?
The Tremor Off-Road Package has nothing to do with the rather charming monster movie with Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward (sadly); but it does have everything to do with actually working in off-road situations. For a start, you lose none of the Super Duty’s towing or payload ratings. The package is available for XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum F-250 and F-350 Super Duty, with either the 7.3-liter gas V8 or 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel. The Tremor Off-Road Package can be added to any 4×4 single-rear-wheel, crew cab Super Duty truck with a 6.75-foot box. If you want it for the F-250 models, you have to get the high-capacity trailer towing package. But you were going to get that anyway so no biggie.
Related: An inside look at the 2020 Ford Super Duty, Dearborn’s big slugger.
Bring Out The Heavy Equipment
The first thing you’ll notice are big, 35-inch-diameter Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac tires. These would be the largest diameter tires available on a heavy-duty pickup, which Ford demurely refers to as “aggressive.” The wheels are also 18-inch, black matte-finish numbers. Along with the boss meats and rims you get a two-inch front-end lift and a shorter air dam for a total of 10.8 inches of ground clearance. Have to deal with streams? How about water fording of 33 inches? Add to that the best approach and departure angles of any Super Duty ever: 31.65 and 24.51 degrees, respectively.

The “progressive-rate” springs balance the towing performance while controlling body motion on rutted, bolder-infested trails. Ford dropped the spring rate on the rear stabilizer bar for less giggling of your head over those rutted, bolder-infested trails. Shocks are custom, 1.7-inch piston twin-tube dampers, which is impressive as a factory part. They have, of course, substantial oil volume for lower internal temperatures.
Traction Jackson
The rear diff is a full-locker with electronic shift-on-the-fly ability. Up front you’ll find a new Dana limited-slip differential. There’s an optional torque-steering package for the front axle that can sense a loss of traction and use the brakes to send power to the wheel with traction. Additional hardware goodies include running boards that tuck up next to the body, so as not to get torn completely off by that humongous rock you just cleared.
There are five drive modes in the 2020 Super Duty with the Tremor package: Normal for around-town use, Tow/Haul for better performance when towing, Eco for enhanced fuel economy, Slippery for icy conditions, and Deep Snow/Sand for low-traction situations. Unique to the Tremor is a rock-crawl mode for 4×4 low situations. It’s enabled by the standard TorqShift 10-speed automatic transmission, so it’s a snap to use.
Come Crawling Back
Trucks with the 7.3-liter gas engine have a 53:1 crawl ratio while those with the 6.7-liter diesel have a 44:1 ratio. And, for the first time ever, there’s Trail Control for the Super Duty. This feature, pulled from the F-150 Raptor and Ranger, functions in any mode like cruise control, but for off-road driving. If you still get stuck, then I don’t know what to tell ya son.
The Tremor Off-Road Package will be available when the 2020 Super Duty launches later this year. No word yet on price.

2019/07/05,Bentley Continental GT Convertible Number 1 Edition: The ‘Blower’ Celebrates 100 Years,"Limited edition model pays homage to the Bentley Blower of 1929 for the automaker’s 100th birthday.
Bespoke treatments include 18 carat gold-plated fender badging and “Number 1” painted front grille.
The Bentley Continental GT Convertible Number 1 Edition is limited to just 100 examples worldwide.
I was going to say having this beast painted red, even a rather fetching shade of red, is an affront to traditional British sensibilities. However, two things prevent me from saying that with the Bentley Continental GT Convertible Number 1 Edition. One, the original Bentley this pays tribute to was painted that color; and, two, if you typically get in a snit about that sort of thing, Bentley, now being owned and run by Germans, is more than snit-inducing enough for you.
That aside, this is rather a beast of a car.
What Is The Bentley Continental GT Convertible Number 1 Edition?
July 10th marks Bentley’s 100th year in the business of making cars. Big, fast, luxurious cars. Back then, they were faster than you’d expect, and these days, they are still faster than you’d expect. This particular car here, known as the Number 1 Edition, is a tribute to the first Bentley hotrod.
The new Number 1 Edition (which I am still ambivalent about, name-wise) draws its inspiration from the original No. 1 Blower, i.e. the thing had a supercharger about the size of a toilet tank hanging off the front end of its 4.5-liter engine. The original No. 1 Blower set the Outer Circuit record at Brooklands in 1932. How fast, you ask? An average of 137 mph, which is pretty surprising, given that most airplanes still had two wings back then. Yes, in case you’re wondering, it was driven by the legendary Bentley Boy Tim Birkin.
Power is amply-provided by an enhanced version of Bentley’s big 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged W12 TSI engine. Said mill is mated to a dual-clutch eight-speed transmission. The bodywork is done up by Mulliner in Crewe, England, and the Bentley Rotating Display has a small wheel spinner, reminiscent of those found on the original No.1 set in resin, a nice touch.
That was then, and today, we have this fitting tribute: the Bentley Continental GT Convertible Number 1 Edition by Mulliner.
Merging Past & Present
The Bentley Continental GT Convertible Number 1 Edition by Mulliner – which you could call the CGTCN1EbM (if you were weird) – will be limited to only 100 examples. The Number 1 Edition is the last car in Bentley’s Centenary trilogy of specials, joining the Mulsanne W.O. Edition and the Continental GT Number 9 Edition.

In addition to the trick bits from the Bentley Black Line Specification and Carbon Body Kit, this Limited Edition comes in Dragon Red II or Beluga paint, with a Claret or Beluga folding top. Personally, go with the dark red color, just like original.
There is, of course, more stuff that ties the modern version with the original. This Number 1 Edition features the Bentley Centenary Specification Pack, including Centenary badges on the rear and wheel centers; gear lever and steering wheel; even the keyfob gets a Centenary badge. There’s a ginormous Number 1 painted on the grille (which is so choice), an 18 carat gold-plated fender badge, jeweled fuel filler and oil caps (because you’re rich), and big, stonking 22-inch MDS wheels in either Cricket Ball or Gloss Black.
Interior Treatments: Gold & Wood
On the inside, you will find a new color split of either Cricket Ball or Beluga complemented by Heritage hide on the seats and door pads. There’s a debossed B insignia on the headrests and door inserts. To answer your questions: no, I don’t know what color “Cricket Ball” is exactly; no I don’t know what color “Heritage hide” is either.
I do know debossed is the opposite of embossed, so I’m one out of three.
Welcoming you into this luxurious cabin is a special Number 1 tread-plate. The cabin is a literal forest’s worth of wood veneer with a Grand Black finish; plus 18 carat gold-plated organ stops, and an Alcantara steering wheel and gear lever. There’s a British Jaeger clock (Jaegers are British?) and a Turned Aluminum dashboard as a nod to the typical race car finish of the 1920s and ‘30s.
For you? Of course it is, if your bank account measures up.

2019/07/04,2020 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe: When Having Four Doors Is More Fun,"Destiny has spoken. If you want a sporty and luxurious grand touring car, but can’t stand the thought of spending $220,000 on a Bentley Continental GT, the new BMW 8 Series – in coupe or convertible body style – is the next best thing. Then again, if you want to get your hands on the new BMW 8 Series, the Gran Coupe version will make you pause. Even though the two-door version of the 8 Series is a massive car, there isn’t enough room for adult passengers in the back. I don’t mind having my dog in there when I’m alone, but what if I want to share the driving experience with friends and family?
Hence the 8 Series Gran Coupe. This is why having four doors is more fun in the real world.
Make no mistake about it. The 2020 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe remains a niche car for a niche set of buyers. Yet it manages to stir the pot and add flavor to a market dominated by the Porsche Panamera and Mercedes-Benz CLS.
The 2020 BMW 8-Series Gran Coupe: Offering More For Less
The good thing is the original design of the 8 Series two-door is also evident in the Gran Coupe version. In fact, both cars are almost identical from the front bumper to the A-pillar, but that’s where the similarities end. Beyond that, everything is unique to the 8 Series Gran Coupe.
Obviously, the Gran Coupe has four doors, so BMW had to make it bigger still. The 8 Series Gran Coupe is nine inches longer and 2.2 inches taller than the original 8 Series Coupe/Convertible. It also happens to be 1.2 inches wider for a more planted look. Enhancing the stance is a rear track measuring 65.8 inches which, mind you, is the widest track of any BMW automobile in existence.
The result is a 7.9 inch longer wheelbase versus the coupe. This means having the proper room for five adults, or maybe four adults and a large dog. The windshield is taller to raise the roofline too. This means 3.4 inches more rear headroom. If you consider the rear legroom increasing by 7.2 inches and shoulder room by 7.7 inches, then you have a spacious and practical GT car with enough cargo space to easily carry a set of golf bags.
Gran Coupe: First 8-Series With An Inline-Six
But don’t think for a second you’re getting a so-so inline six. It’s the latest iteration of the German automaker’s TwinPower 3.0-liter six-cylinder mill. It comes with direct-injection and a twin-scroll turbocharger to churn out 335 horsepower and 368 lb. ft. of torque.
More importantly, all that torque is accessible from 1,600 all the way to 4,500 rpm. This essentially means having the pull of a large, high-tech diesel motor without pushing the pedal to the floor. This new inline-six is unique; the exhaust manifold is integrated into the cylinder head while the charge air cooler is incorporated into the intake system. This design improves flow in all stages of the combustion process. BMW’s fully variable valve-timing system (VALVETRONIC) also helps in improving power delivery. The motor uses a new integral heat exchanger and oil module with a split cooling valve to keep everything cool.

With this mill, the 8 Series Gran Coupe is no slouch. It pulls steadily to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds with rear-wheel drive. The xDrive AWD version achieves the feat in 4.6 seconds with a top speed of 130 mph. You can raise that to 155 mph if you ask nicely for high-performance tires.
V8 Power FTW
The inline-six is good and all but what if you want more power? The good news is, the marvelous, 4.4-liter twin-turbo monster in the 8 Series Coupe and Convertible is also available in the Gran Coupe.
The M850i xDrive Gran Coupe produces 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft. of torque and is bristling with technology. The twin-scroll turbochargers are found between the V-shaped cylinder banks of the motor. With high-precision fuel injection, variable valve control, and Double-VANOS variable camshaft timing, the mill ensures abrupt power delivery throughout the rev range. On the inside, the cylinder walls are treated with an iron coating and the pistons are further reinforced with a coating of Grafal to eliminate frictional losses. The engine block is crafted from aluminum alloy to reduce weight.
And since the new 8 Series Gran Coupe is a luxury car, BMW included a viscous damper on the crankshaft. This improves the smoothness of the motor even as it strains at higher speeds. With this powerful mill, the new 8 Series Gran Coupe sprints from zero to 60 mph in a supercar-threatening 3.7 seconds.

Transmission & All-Wheel Drive Technology
Both the inline-six and V8 receive an eight-speed Steptronic automatic and xDrive all-wheel drive. The former has an optimized hydraulics control unit for faster and smoother shifts. The transmission adapts the shift parameters to the current driving conditions using the standard navigation system, which is similar to the transmission of a Rolls-Royce.
Meanwhile, the xDrive is a rear-biased system that feeds power strictly to the rear wheels in normal driving mode. It redirects power to the front wheels as needed, courtesy of an electronically-controlled multi-plate clutch. It sounds complicated for sure, but it works seamlessly in the background to ensure the best traction on any type of road.
Chassis, Suspension & Steering
Without a doubt, the 2020 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe is essentially a four-door sports car. It was honed and developed together with the 8-Series Coupe and M8 GTE endurance race car. This means a carbon fiber-infused chassis using BMW’s proprietary Carbon Core technology. Suspension-wise, the 8 Series Gran Coupe receives an adaptive M suspension with double-wishbones in the front. The rear consists of a five-link setup with bi-elastic bushings. According to BMW, this enables a balance between sporty handling and a comfortable, silent ride.
The 8 Series Gran Coupe also comes with Integral Active Steering technology. This feature is standard on the 840i XDrive and M850i xDrive while optional on the base 840i RWD. This tech utilizes the electro-mechanical and Servotoronic speed-sensitive steering of the front wheels with the variable steering ratio on the rear axle. The result is better agility at higher speeds and a reduction of the turning circle when maneuvering or parking the vehicle.

Luxurious Interior (And Then Some)
Without question, the luxury theme is eminent inside the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe. The dashboard and upper door panels are covered in Nappa leather. The seats are wrapped in premium Vernasca leather in ivory white, black, or cognac. Two-tone leather seats are available as well. The extended center console – unique to the Gran Coupe – continues to the rear and divides the individually-styled right and left seats without obstructing the center seat. This center console houses climate controls, air vents, a storage tray, and USB ports for the rear occupants.
The 8 Series Gran Coupe 840i and 840i XDrive come standard with just about everything: 18-inch wheels, remote engine start, and a panoramic moonroof; the seats, armrests and steering wheel are heated; LED headlights with BMW Laserlight and a heads-up display are also standard. In addition, the 16-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, wireless charging, and Wi-Fi hotspot are all standard. BMW’s Live Cockpit Professional with iDrive 7 and Apple CarPlay round out the long list of tech features.
Safety & Security
The driving assistance package is optional on all trim models of the 8 Series Gran Coupe. This includes a surround view 3D camera, active park control, active driving assistant, blind spot detection, lane departure warning, and parking assistant plus. Upgrading to the Driving Assistance Professional Package gives you more yet: active cruise control with stop & go, active blind spot protection, frontal collision warning, active lane keeping assist with side-collision avoidance, and an emergency stop assistant system.
Wheel & Kit Upgrades
The M Sport Package increases the wheel size to either 19 inches with all-season run-flat tires, or 20 inches with high-performance run-flats. This package also throws in a new M steering wheel, multi-functional seats, and an aerodynamic kit among other things. The M850i xDrive with the V8 motor gets even more kit, including 20-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension and M sport differential, sport brakes and exhaust, and ventilated seats.
2020 BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe: Pricing & Availability
The 2020 BMW 840i Gran Coupe starts at $84,900. The 840i XDrive Gran Coupe has a base price of $108,900. Compare this with the $112,000 base price of the 8 Series Coupe with the same V8 engine and xDrive AWD, you get more doors, more space, and a car that still looks awesome despite paying less.
Meanwhile, the M850i xDrive starts at $108,900. Expect the first deliveries to commence in September.

2019/06/29,2020 Chevy Silverado HD: Tough Workhorse Gets Tougher Still,"The 2020 Chevy Silverado HD receives a host of upgrades to increase performance.
Heading into retirement is the 6.0-liter gas engine. A more powerful gas V8 takes its place. 
The Duramax power figures are unchanged but new cooling methods boost towing numbers.
From the engines and chassis, to all the towing tech: an in-depth look at the new Silverado HD.
Chevrolet has been teasing us with the new Silverado HD since last year. We knew it would look like a hulked-up Silverado 1500; we were expecting it to be, per Chevy’s promises, the strongest and most capable Silverado HD ever made. After debuting earlier this year, we felt an in-depth look on the inner makings of the 2020 Chevy Silverado HD was in order.
Turns out, our lucky stars were smiling upon us. We had the chance to chat with Bob Walczyk, Chevrolet Product Marketing Manager for light and heavy duty pickups.
If there’s one person who knows every nut and bolt in the new Silverado HD, it would be Bob Walczyk. “I’ve actually been working on this new generation truck since its inception,” he said. “I’ve been quite intimate to the vehicle all along the process here. It’s very exciting now to see this thing on the road.”
2020 Chevy Silverado HD: What’s New?
Let’s proceed to the most obvious part: the way it looks. No doubt, the new Silverado HD is bigger, longer, and taller than before.
In fact, the wheelbase is 5.2 inches longer than the outgoing model, with overall length increasing by a massive 10.4 inches. In order to establish the truck’s presence, the width is now 81.9 inches, which is 1.4 inches wider than before. The new Silverado HD is also 1.6 inches taller overall. “One thing we got from our research was how the truck needed to be bigger,” Walczyk said. “Customers wanted it to be bigger than the light duty; it needed to be heavy duty. If I’m buying a heavy duty truck it needs to look the part.”
Despite looking like the steroid-infused big brother of the Silverado 1500, the new HD shares precisely zero body panels with the 1500 – except for the roof. The tailgate and larger hood are aluminum to manage weight, but all the other body panels are steel. Chevrolet was even kind enough to make the outer door skins smooth for easier signage applications. This is handy for business owners who put their company name, logo, and phone number on the side of the truck.
Beefed-Up Underpinnings
Accompanying the increase in physical size are stronger and more durable underpinnings. The driveline in the 2020 Chevy Silverado HD is larger and more muscular than before. The bigger front and rear axles connect to a robust aluminum propeller shaft. “We use 6061 P6 aluminum for the prop shaft, which is fairly common in the industry,” Walczyk said. This new prop shaft is 30 percent larger in diameter for greater strength, something Walczyk says is important. “The new HD’s prop shaft is 3.5 millimeters thick, which is the thickest gauge we’ve ever used,” he continued.
The Silverado 2500 also receives a standard 11.5-inch ring gear while the 3500 gets an enormous 12-inch ring gear.
Since the 2020 Chevy Silverado HD is bigger than its predecessor, it’s sitting on a larger chassis as well. The frame better withstands the rudiments of heavy towing by utilizing what might seem like small modifications. “Actually, one of the big things we did in the frame area was integrating our fifth-wheel prep to the frame itself,” Walczyk explained. “In the past, it was done after the truck was assembled, so we literally pulled the box, then added the plate. Now it is integrated into the frame and we’ve got a much tighter connection there. That was a huge enabler for our customers who tow,” he added.

2020 Genesis G90: It’s a Whole Lot of Car
Chevrolet also made a change in the frame regarding corrosion protection. “We believe this will outlast most vehicle ownership cycles,” Walczyk said.
Power To Move The World: 6.6-Liter V8
Perhaps the biggest and most important change to the 2020 Chevy Silverado HD is in the engine department. The standard motor is a larger, 6.6-liter V8 gasoline mill with direct-injection technology (GDI). The new tech allows it to churn out 401 horsepower (5200 rpm) and 464 lb-ft. of torque (4000 rpm). That’s 11 percent more horsepower and 22 percent more torque than the previous 6.0-liter unit. Chevrolet built the new motor with a cast-iron block and aluminum heads. You’ll also find a forged steel crankshaft and forged powder-metal connecting rods.
“The 6.0-liter is very reliable, but it’s also been out there for quite a while, so we have been itching to bring the gas engine up a little more in terms of modern technology,” Walczyk said. “One of the biggest things we did was going to a direct injection system. We are going to be the first to do that in the gas engines in the heavy-duty segment.”
The GDI system allows the motor to operate at a higher 10.8:1 compression ratio. It also features a longer 3.85 stroke (versus 3.62 in the 6.0). The hike in power and torque also means greater towing capabilities – 18 percent more versus the 6.0 gas. The new gasoline motor pairs with a GM 6L90 six-speed automatic with a Tow/Haul mode.
Power To Move The World: 6.6-liter Duramax Turbo-Diesel
However, if towing really heavy loads is a daily occurrence, you need the 6.6-liter Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8. The new Duramax produces 445 horsepower (2800 rpm) and a substantial 910 lb-ft. of torque (1600). The diesel mill connects to an Allison 10-speed automatic (10L1000) with new calibrations and a 3.42:1 axle ratio. When all is said and done, a properly-equipped Silverado HD tows up to 35,500 lbs., a 52 percent max towing increase versus the outgoing Silverado HD.
While the horsepower and torque numbers remain the same from 2017, Walczyk explains how the towing increase came about. “We haven’t really used all that power because the truck was chassis constrained and cooling constrained,” he said. “With the new architecture we opened things up; we increased airflow and oil cooling capacity.” Among the more significant changes is the 19-plate cooler versus a 15-plate cooler in the prior generation.
“And we increased the fan from 25.5 inches to 28 inches,” Walczyk added. “This fan just humongous when you see it.”
It’s All About Towing: More Tech Please
There’s a reason why buyers want a bigger, meaner, and more powerful Silverado HD. It has something to do with that thing called towing.
In addition to landing the highest possible numbers, designers spent equal time on the actual towing experience. “We did a lot of research,” Walczyk revealed. “Around 93 percent of our truck owners tow and about half tow over 8,000 lbs. regularly.” During those market research sessions, Walczyk said it was “loud and clear” that customers wanted easier towing by way of modern technology. “They were very interested in lights, cameras, and sensors,” he continued. “They wanted to see better and take advantage of those things all around the truck.”

The solution is the Advanced Trailering System, a first for the Chevy Silverado HD. The system offers up to 15 high-definition camera views, including surround vision, a bed camera, and a trick transparent trailer view camera. The latter allows you to see out the back as if the trailer wasn’t there in the first place! It uses two cameras: one tailgate-mounted camera and an available accessory camera for the rear of the trailer.
It’s All About Towing: Vantage Points
When pulling a trailer down the road, the camera system matches the turn signals; meaning when the left signal is on, the camera view is bias to the left, and vice versa for the right.
“Your view is going to be 80/20, 70/30 or 60/40 depending on how far you’re turning the steering wheel and in what direction,” Walczyk said. “It really zeros in on where that trailer is going. If you are pulling a 40-foot trailer, you’re going to see if you are getting near that curb or not.”
Related: From 1918 to 2019: a walk through over 100 years of Chevy truck history.
Diesel After-Run Feature
Think of it as a “turbo timer,” the same thing found in tuned examples of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and Subaru Impreza. The idea is to keep the engine running or idling after a demanding towing situation. The diesel after-run feature prevents the engine from shutting down for up to 15 minutes, giving the motor a chance to cool using the larger fan.
But what happens if you throw it in park and turn the engine off? The truck will simply restart after departing the cabin, turning itself off after reaching the appropriate temperature. So what you basically have is an immensely powerful diesel truck with a sports car feature.
Neat stuff, I say.
Family Matters
For many, buying a truck is more than just purchasing a vehicle. It’s more than having the freedom to move about, or the ability to haul everything in a single load. Like most trucks, the 2020 Chevy Silverado HD will end up a member of the family. It’s the pal at work, or the friend who is with you no matter what. A survey last year from Chevy and Harris Poll found that 45 percent of truck owners plan on passing their pickup down to a child or loved one. Another 60 percent say they “cannot live” without their truck.
“People spend a lot of money on these trucks, so they want the vehicle to do everything for them. It’s something they use for their livelihood and to pull their toys on the weekend,” Walczyk said. “I’m driving one right now and it’s phenomenal; it’s been a joy to drive.”

2019/06/28,2020 Chrysler Voyager & Pacifica: A Little Nostalgia & A Lot Modern,"The 2020 Chrysler Voyager is a budget-focused minivan but the name rings of nostalgia.
For 2020, the Voyager joins the refreshed Pacifica and Pacifica Hybrid in FCA’s minivan lineup.
Pacifica and Pacifica Hybrid benefit from a lighter architecture and a “vault-like” interior design.    
The 2020 Chrysler Voyager was once known by another name. “I predict the Voyager and the Caravan will be to the 80s what the Mustang was to the 60s,” said Lee A. Iacocca in 1984, then chairman of Chrysler Corporation. The struggling Auburn Hills automaker would enter a period of resurgence under these two platforms; the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Iacocca believed these two would force other manufacturers to come up with copycat versions.
And indeed, that has been the case.
Ford and General Motors had their versions, from the Windstar to the Venture; Toyota, Honda, and Kia today each offer a minivan, but the the segment’s champion is arguably the one who invented it. Chrysler has sold more than 14.6 million minivans globally since 1983, twice as many as any other manufacturer over the past 35 years.
What Is The Chrysler Voyager?
The 2020 Chrysler Voyager is the budget-friendly option in contrast to the higher trim levels of the Pacifica and Pacifica Hybrid. The Voyager replaces the Pacifica L and LX but offers fleet buyers an exclusive trim level. Standard features include seven-passenger seating, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and various other smartphone capabilities. Voyager has additional ease-of-entry options from BraunAbility for buyers who use a wheelchair.
Rear park assist (with stop), blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross path detection are among the optional safety features. Trim levels include L, LX, and LXi – the latter being the fleet-only option. There are six available colors: the Jazz Blue and Velvet Red pearl coats sound the snazziest.
2020 Chrysler Voyager: Under The Hood & In The Cabin
The Voyager scoots around town with FCA’s evergreen Pentastar V6. The engine, married to a TorqueFlite nine-speed automatic, creates 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft. of torque. The powertrain is a trustworthy one, as the Pentastar has landed on the annual list of Wards 10 Best Engines six different times since its 2010 debut. The 2020 Chrysler Pacifica will employ the same engine. Fuel economy ratings for the current 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 in the Pacifica come in at 19/28 city/highway and 22 combined.
An optional, single overhead DVD player is available on the Voyager LX for those longer road trips. In-floor storage bins make it easy to stash goodies and gear; and the Stow ‘n Place roof rack is useful for all kinds of recreational items. Up front, the Uconnect 4 system enables a host of entertainment and navigation features via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

2020 Chrysler Pacifica
The Chrysler Pacifica namesake was completely re-engineered, debuting at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit. The Pacifica in its current form has a lighter, stiffer architecture to reduce body roll and fuel consumption, while cutting road noise and absorbing crash energy in the event of a collision. The architecture serves as the basis for the Pacifica’s “vault-style” interior, something FCA says makes the vehicle more comfortable to drive.
“We continuously researched and tried to get customer feedback on how to improve everything,” Patrick Keitz, Chrysler Brand Product Manager, told us in 2016 at NAIAS. “We looked at what affects ride, handling, and cargo capacity and it all comes back to the new architecture.”
Highlights for 2020 include the Red S Appearance Package, seating for eight, and more than 100 standard and available safety and security features. The 2020 Chrysler Pacifica has four trim levels: Touring, Touring L, Touring L Plus, and Limited. A 35th Anniversary Edition with commemorative badging and Cranberry Wine interior stitching is available through the end of year.
Red S Appearance Package
The S Appearance Package gives the Pacifica the ever-popular “blacked-out” look. The Red S Appearance adds a few extra streaks on the canvas with Rodèo Red Nappa leather seats, Light Diesel Grey stitching and piping, and Silver Metal Brush accents for the instrument panel and door trim. The tunes come courtesy of a 20-speaker Harman Kardon premium stereo, one of the package’s finer touches.
Outside, there is a special liftgate badge and blacked-out Chrysler wing badges; non-hybrid Pacificas receive 20-inch wheels with a Black Noise finish. The Red S Appearance treatments come in six of the vehicle’s 10 color choices, any of which should look stellar. While on offer for both the gas and hybrid models, the Red S look is only (unfortunately) available for the Limited trim.

Boatload of Tech
The 2020 Chrysler Pacifica resembles the bridge of the Starship Enterprise in terms of technology. Absent only the photon torpedoes but with plenty of shields, the Pacifica boasts more than 100 standard and available safety features. Some of the banner ones include a 360-degree Surround View Camera; ParkSense Parallel/Perpendicular Park Assist; Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go, and Forward Collision Warning-Plus.
Like the Voyager, the Uconnect 4 system enables a plethora of entertainment and navigation features via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. And, for good measure, the Uconnect Theater features two 10-inch seatback touchscreens – are you not entertained!?
2020 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid
The Pacifica Hybrid is the fourth best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle from the 30 available in the market. It hauls in more than 80 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) in electric-only mode, with an all-electric range exceeding 30 miles. Total range, with a fully-charged battery, is over 500 miles.

Oh and dig that new honeycomb grille pattern for 2020.
Hybrid Tools
Like the gas Pacifica, the Hybrid tacks on the same safety technology and convenience features, although with a modified 3.6-liter Pentastar V6. The jewel of the hybrid system is the FCA US-designed, dual-motor eFlite, electrically-variable transmission. (Say that ten times fast!). The device runs two electric motors – both of which can drive the vehicle’s wheels.
The Pacifica Hybrid’s 16-kWh battery pack is under the second-row floor. It can be recharged in about two hours using a 240-volt plug-in system. The 2020 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid comes in three flavors: Touring, Touring L, and Limited.

2019/06/26,Mini John Cooper Works GP: Prototype Testing On The Nürburgring,"Mini is testing the new John Cooper Works GP on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife.
Details are slim, but Mini says the engine delivers more than 300 horsepower. 
Expect a limited production run of only 3,000 units when it arrives next year.   
Mini is about to roll out another version of their John Cooper Works GP, the hot rod, high performance model of the cute little Anglo-German hatchback. And although performance details are scarce at this time, they are rolling it out in style. They debuted the little pocket rocket at this year’s 24-hour race at the Nürburgring.
This news from Mini comes of the heels of their most recent announcements regarding the 2020 John Cooper Works Clubman and Countryman.
New Mini John Cooper Works GP: Prototype Versus Production
24-hours of the Nürburgring happened this past weekend and it was, as always, kinda nuts. On the one hand, I’m glad they still run actual races there. On the other, it’s like a ticking time bomb; eventually there’s going to be “the big one” and then the hue and cry to ban racing on one of history’s great tracks will rise once again (and might even be listened to).
With that as the background, you have to admit debuting your latest hot model on this stage is a pretty cool move. Mini goes to great lengths to point out how this is a prototype of the new, extreme version in the lineup. But c’mon, how far off from the final production form can this really be? The John Cooper Works GP version will hit the market next year, limited to just 3,000 units. Mini didn’t say, but I’m assuming that’s the total worldwide production run. No word on how many America will get.
As luck would have it, Mini was rushing to get data logged before this year’s 24-hour race, with the John Cooper Works GP pounding out runs on the Nordschleife as part of its development process. Mini didn’t give exact numbers, but said the little guy is already boasting lap times almost a half a minute below the record set by its predecessor.
That’s a big chunk of time to cleave off.
Shots Fired
Obviously this is more than a warning shot that Mini intends to take the hatchback record home with them very soon. And obviously, this is very good for you and me, the well-meaning but sadly underfunded gearheads of the world. New, absolute records by Ferrari and Porsche and such are well and good, but theoretically I’ll be able to afford a hot version of a Mini long before I can buy a La Ferrari.

Although short on production, the new Mini John Cooper Works GP is long on other numbers. For starters, the little four-banger under the hood puts out 301 horsepower, which is a lot for such a small engine. They must have the turbos squeezed within an inch of their life. The air intakes are wide open and the wheels are large but light alloy affairs. There’s also a striking roof spoiler that’s as functional as it is new.

Testing Is Ongoing
Given how the prior Mini John Cooper Works GP set a benchmark for the company at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (8:23); and Mini says this one knocks “half a minute” off that, we’re talking about a hatchback that can lap the infamous Green Hell in less than eight minutes. I’ll let that pretty staggering figure settle in while I leave you this parting shot from the engineers: “its testing program is not yet over.”
The new Mini John Cooper Works GP will reach U.S. showrooms by the middle of next year with an MSRP of $44,900. Tack on another $850 for destination and handling.

2019/06/24,2020 Lexus GX 460: A Big Bundle of Safety & Off-Road Tech,"The 2020 Lexus GX 460 receives a number of updates for the new model year.
Four-Wheel Active Traction and Crawl Control are useful for rougher terrain. 
The technology features are numerous and focus mainly on convenience.
Lexus just put out the deets on its new GX 460 SUV and this thing is crawling with features of all varieties. Tech, safety, comfort and convenience, the lot. They even upped the beast’s off-road capabilities (not that you’re seriously going to do King of The Hammers in this thing). But for what it is, it’s hard to argue with the 2020 Lexus GX 460.
Of course, there is one way you can argue with it.
Case & Point
Lexus touts the “restyling” of the GX 460, and that’s one of the biggest arguments against it. “The 2020 GX wears an updated signature spindle grille that gives it distinctive, standout style which better aligns with the entire Lexus portfolio.” Just make sure your face is better aligned with the toilet bowl, because I swear to Buddha that Stevie Wonder could see how ugly it is. Someone please, please grab the head of Lexus’ styling department by the collar and make them stop with this grille “design.”
I’ve seen more pleasing designs in Soviet apartment blocks.
However, if you can get beyond the face, what makes the 2020 Lexus GX 460 worth it? Well, for starters, the drivetrain and how it puts the power down is worth considering.
2020 Lexus GX 460 Powertrain: A Control Freak
The 4.6-liter V8 in the GX 460 cranks out 301 horsepower, 329 lb-ft. of torque and, when properly equipped, handles 6,500 lbs. worth of towing duty. If you’ve got stuff to tow, the Trailer Sway and Vehicle Stability Control systems will help you keep things under, er, control.
Control is a big deal for the GX 460. Lexus references that word all over the place in their press materials. The Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, for example, is there to “enhance handling and ride comfort,” while keeping the vehicle level both on and off-road. In other words, the Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System helps you maintain control of the GX 460. The Adaptive Variable Suspension features “electronically-controlled dampers” with driver selectable modes: Normal, Sport, or Comfort.
The Lexus GX 460 also has Four-Wheel Active Traction; meaning the TORSEN torque-sensing, limited-slip differential splits power 40:60 (front to rear) under most driving conditions, changing the ratio as needed based on wheel slip. The drive system has a low range for slow speed, off-pavement situations; and the center differential can be electronically-locked, further enhancing the GX’s off-road capabilities. Added to all the drivetrain goodies is a wide array of chassis control technology: Downhill Assist and Hill-Start Assist Control; Active Traction and Vehicle Stability Control; and finally, Crawl Control.

Like I said, control is a big deal for the 2020 Lexus GX 460. Although I seriously doubt you will be blasting through Moab with the thing.
Related: Lots of space for the family: on the road with the 2018 Lexus GX 460.
Colorful Array & Ample Services
And all of this capability and control comes in seven exterior colors: Starfire Pearl, Atomic Silver, Nebula Gray Pearl, Nightfall Mica, Fire Agate Pearl, Black Onyx, and Claret Mica. The GX’s interior is available in four colors: Black, Sepia, Ecru, and a new Rioja Red with black headliner.
Speaking of the interior, it is, as you would expect, all about the multimedia and connectivity functions. It all starts with the touchscreen system with a customizable home screen that can display three sections simultaneously. The navigation system has a three-dimensional map view and there are four USB ports. Lexus Enform Safety Connect allows access to Lexus response centers 24/7/365, while Lexus Enform Service Connect sends maintenance alerts to you and your dealer.
Lexus Enform Remote lets you lock and unlock the doors; start the engine and climate controls; and check the fuel level (and more) through your smartphone, smartwatch or other devices using Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa.
Safety & Security
The new GX 460 is also as safe as they can make it with the Lexus Safety System+ suite of technologies now standard. This includes the Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert, Intelligent High Beams, and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. The intuitive high beams offer more intelligent illumination, for lack of a better word. When the road is clear, the system defaults to the high-beams, temporarily switching to low beams when it detects another vehicle.
Pricing & Availability
As of this writing we don’t know either, but the current GX 460 starts at $52,502. There is a lot to like about the 2020 Lexus GX 460; it’s capacious, comfortable, loaded with features to make your journey go easier, and has a slew of off-roading goodies that are great, even if 99 percent of the owners will never use them. Just don’t pay too much attention to the way it looks.

2019/06/24,2020 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4: Flat-Sixes & Perfect 10s,"If you believe the rumor mill, there were ongoing discussions (arguments, some say) within Porsche whether to build the latest 718 Caymans around six cylinders or four-bangers like they originally started out with. It looks like the gearheads won, because the latest variants will be packing a very impressive and powerful flat six. Huzzah! And that naturally-aspirated flat-six makes the 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 and Spyder the most powerful 718s to date.
Huzzah!
What Is The 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4?
The 718 Cayman GT4 and 718 Spyder are right on the cutting edge of where Porsche is going to go. From an engineering perspective, a mid-engine car is much better than one with a rear engine. Porsche is a German company. German’s are (supposedly) cold blooded and logical. But Porsche also makes the 911, a decidedly rear-engine car. Meaning that Porsche has a lot of marketing momentum and – dare I say it – sentimentality tied up in keeping the iconic 911 as the top of the heap.
Ergo, the aforementioned discussions/arguments within Zuffenhausen about just how good to make the company’s mid-engine cars.
The answer, apparently, is Verdammt gut! because for 2020, the Cayman GT4 and Spyder are motivated down der bahn via a 4.0-liter flat-six that puts out 414 horsepower and 309 lb-ft. of torque. That is, technically speaking, “a lot” given the size of these cars and the rather healthy output from that big of an engine.
Torque Vectoring & Active Suspension
That engine has an 8,000 rpm red line and that six-speed transmission, although an old style manual, has an “Auto Blip” function that automatically matches gearbox and engine speeds during downshifts. Pretty trick. But if it’s too trick for you, it can be turned off. There’s a standard mechanical limited-slip differential with torque vectoring for optimum traction.
This all adds up to a zero to 60 time of 4.2 seconds for either the hardtop or the convertible. vMax is 188 mph for the GT4, while the Spyder can “only” reach 187 mph.
The performance (and the performance goodies) don’t stop there. Both cars share the track-bred Porsche Active Suspension Management system with its adaptive dampers, helper springs on the rear axle, and a ride height that is 1.18 inches lower than a standard 718 Boxster or Cayman. The suspension is fully-adjustable for those of you that, say, AutoX on the weekends and really want to tweak things. So, adjustments of camber, toe, ride height, and different anti-roll bar settings are there for the asking.

Straight Outta The Parts Bin
Porsche lifted the front axle from the 2018 911 GT3 and went to the same parts bin for the brakes. The standard stoppers are 380 mm cast iron rotors front and rear but, if you’re like me (and you have the money), go with the optional Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes. They will save a whopping 50 percent of the weight versus their cast iron brethren, and also stop you like you threw out an anchor. The carbon ceramic rotors measure 410 mm in the front and 390 mm at the rear.
The tires are giant-sized affairs, riding on silver or Satin Platinum wheels, clocking in at 245/35 ZR 20s at the front and 295/30 ZR 20s at the rear. Of course, there’s ABS but there is also electronic stability and traction control, specifically dialed-in for the 718s. Yes, the ESC and TC can be switched off and in two stages at that. In case lap times count for your purchase decisions, the 718 Cayman GT4 can lap the Nordschleife more than ten seconds faster than its predecessor.

Trademark Treatments
The 718 Cayman GT4 and Spyder are visually separated from their lesser stable-mates by the front spoiler lip, and the central air outlet ahead of the front luggage compartment lid (which helps with downforce and cooling). There are two “dynamic streamliners” on the rear lid and an automatically-extending rear spoiler found on the convertible. The rear diffuser is new and frames the sport exhaust system on both cars.
The GT4 gets its own manually-adjustable rear wing and side air intakes with additional side blades.
Step Inside The 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4
The interior is also fresh. There’s a new GT Sport steering wheel (14.1 inches diameter) with a top center marker in black. The shift lever is shorter for a more direct and crispier feel. Sport Seats Plus are standard and have raised side bolsters for high lateral support, something you need on the track. The seat centers are Alcantara, as is the steering wheel rim, the shift lever, and the lower part of the dashboard. Classy. The Cayman GT4 gets Brushed Aluminum interior trim, while the 718 Spyders are painted to match the exterior color.
You can have your choice of either bucket seats or electrically-adjustable, 18-way sport seats. Air conditioning and the Porsche Communication Management system with Sound Package Plus are standard, of course. You can upgrade that with navigation and Apple CarPlay.

The Spyder has its own optional interior package, creatively dubbed the Spyder Classic Interior Package. This gets you two-tone leather in Bordeaux Red and Black, even more Alcantara upholstery, GT Silver Metallic interior trim, and a new, two-tone fabric top in black and red. Decorative interior stitching in red, silver or yellow is available for both cars.
Pricing & Availability
The new Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 and 718 Spyder will reach dealers next spring. Bottom line? They will cost you $97,550 for the 718 Spyder and $100,450 for the 718 Cayman GT4.

2019/06/21,Hyundai Palisade: Bigger Than It Looks (But As Good As They Say),"The 2020 Hyundai Palisade will arrive this summer, replacing the Santa Fe XL. 
With seating for eight, it will likely be a top choice for larger and/or growing families. 
Hyundai says the Palisade is their flagship SUV as it offers a “host of technology features.”   
You know how some cars seem a lot smaller in real life than they do in photos? The 2020 Hyundai Palisade is probably one of those vehicles. Hyundai says it’s a mid-sized SUV, but boy does this thing look massive. It’s a big, rectangular solid sort of ride that looks like the crate they shipped it in. The new Palisade replaces the Santa Fe XL and offers seating for up to eight, which means it’s going to be an ideal choice for larger families.
And while it might not have much style, being a Hyundai, it’s as practical as the day is long.
How Big Is The 2020 Hyundai Palisade?
For comparison, the 2020 Hyundai Palisade is about the same size as the outgoing Hyundai Santa Fe XL, the Toyota Highlander, Honda’s Pilot, the Nissan Pathfinder, and the Ford Explorer. So yeah, mid-sized. And, like its competition in this red-hot market, the Palisade is biased more towards infotainment and safety features rather than high output engines and the ability to traverse the deserts of Moab.
Hyundai calls it “Intuitive Utility,” and that’s as good a way to describe it as any. Who wants to fiddle around learning about the ins and outs of your new SUV – it should be simple and easy to figure out, no?
The Inside Treatment: Nappa Leather & Wood Grain
The interior is designed to give you a sense of relaxation and comfort, and who’d want anything else on a long drive to see relatives, or returning home after some hand-to-hand combat at a big box store. The 2020 Palisade offers two leather options, one of which is quilted Nappa leather. The instrument panel has an available wood grain trim that does a nice wraparound throughout the interior.
The second row allows for one-touch operation – boop – it’s forward and out of the way for easy access to the third-row seats. Oh, and that third row offers power-folding/unfolding and reclining adjustments. If you’d like, there are second-row captain’s chairs available with ventilated seating surfaces. Hyundai threw in a “conversation mirror” for the driver. They naïvely claim this “allows the driver to clearly see passengers in the rear,” but what it’s really there for is for mom and/or dad to keep an eye on you kids, and if you don’t simmer down, I will turn this 2020 Hyundai Palisade around, I swear!!!

Safety & Security: Like A Bank Vault
The suite of safety tech includes a Blind View Monitor, Blind Spot Collision Avoidance Assist, Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Keeping Assist, Lane Following Assist, High Beam Assist, Driver Attention Warning and Smart Cruise Control with Stop and Go. You get in a fender bender with this thing, and you should probably give up on driving all together.
Another nifty feature is this thing called Safe Exit Assist. The system uses radar to detect if cars are approaching and cautions passengers trying to exit the vehicle. It’s even more on top of things than that. If you try to open the door when a car is approaching, an audible and visual warning pops up on the center cluster. Safe Exit Assist will go so far as to keep the rear doors locked until an approaching vehicle has passed. Once the road is clear, you can deactivate the child locks on the rear doors.
The high-strength steel chassis for the 2020 Hyundai Palisade uses special underbody and side structures, along with multiple load paths to better disperse crash energy in the event of a collision.
Infotainment & Technology Features: Now With Mini-Pockets
Infotainment and connectivity and displays are just this side of mission control in the 2020 Hyundai Palisade. Audio and navigation are on a 10.25-inch touchscreen, coupled with the 12.3-inch TFT center instrument cluster. The instrument panel gauge cluster is integrated with navigation and is coupled with the heads-up display. Two Bluetooth devices can be connected simultaneously, there are seven USB outlets, and “mini-pockets” to hold all sorts of digital devices. There are 16 cup holders, because this is America.
Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and a Qi wireless charging pad are standard. The sound system is a Harman Kardon outfit with Clari-Fi and QuantumLogic Surround Sound tech.
2020 Hyundai Palisade: Power & Performance
Another tech feature Hyundai gave us more information on is HTRAC with Snow Mode. HTRAC is Hyundai’s all-wheel-drive system with selectable modes (Normal, Sport, Smart, and Snow). Snow Mode gives you special traction tuning for slippery conditions by adjusting front and rear power distribution; left and right wheel slip; and engine torque and shift patterns to give you the best possible footing on the road.
Naturally, Sport mode sends more torque to the rear wheels.
Speaking of drivetrain stuff, the Palisade has an Atkinson-cycle 3.8-liter V6. The engine, complete with Hyundai’s dual Continuous Variable Valve Timing system and direct injection, kicks out 291 horsepower and 262 lb-ft. of torque. Not exactly high performance, but it should be enough to get the job done. An eight-speed automatic with a final drive ratio of 3.648:1 sends everything to the tarmac.

2019/06/18,BMW Debuts “Smart Glasses” To Assist Technicians In The Field,"BMW is introducing new technology across its dealer network for technicians in the shop. 
New “smart glasses” are part of a larger system to help technicians work more efficiently. 
The glasses and corresponding technology programs will be available later this month. 
BMW is getting into the augmented reality game. BMW plans to use the visual overlay technology in their North American dealerships to reduce repair and maintenance times; thereby increasing overall workshop efficiency and, eventually, improving customer satisfaction. Yes, this applies to MINI Dealers as well.
And no, you, the driver, do not get to wear them while you’re driving. This is about your car, not you specifically as the driver.
We covered this last year when Porsche jumped into the augmented reality game in much the same way. BMW’s plan is called the Technical Support & Research Assistant or TSARA. The AR glasses are called TSARAVision Smart Glasses. Yeah, no, really, TSARAVision. Let’s look beyond that for the time being and delve a little deeper into what the Bavarians are up to.
What Is BMW’s TSARA System?
TSARA is BMW’s new online case-reporting system and not to be confused with Tristan Tzara, the DadAist poet (although it might be fun if you do). BMW’s TSARA aims to speed up the repair and maintenance process by 70 to 75 percent. They aim to do this via an instinctive and mechanic-friendly interface that supplies faster case-entries (handy for book keeping) and full multimedia support. In a nutshell, TSARA aims to provide technicians in the field (i.e. mechanics in dealer repair shops throughout the country) quick and trouble-free access to technical information.
This includes a live link to BMW engineers in real time for further technical support. All of this is part of BMW’s new Technical Information System, or TIS 2.0.
BMW’s new Technical Information System is a multimedia platform for this kind of technician support. It was developed in-house with feedback from technicians in the field by BMW North America, and can be accessed by dealer personnel on any mobile device. When accessed, it puts all technical data for every BMW and MINI model at the technician’s fingertips. This helps mechanics from having to stop in the middle of jobs to flip through shop manuals, or dial up diagrams and such on computer terminals.
How Do BMW’s Smart Glasses Work?
Once hooked up, technicians can collaboratively work through a given issue to resolve it faster and more efficiently. If need be, the expert on the other end will project technical bulletins and schematic drawings onto the display inside the technician’s glasses with step-by-step guides. Technicians can also take screen shots and enlarge images, which sounds real handy.

Ford Expedition: Here's What's New For 2020
I know what you’re thinking. “What about greasy fingers covered in gunk pushing all those sensitive buttons?” BMW is way ahead of you. The mechanic can open and view documents via voice instructions right in the middle of working on your car. Think of it as BMW’s own internal version of Amazon’s Alexa.
“TIS 2.0, TSARA, and the TSARAVision Smart Glasses are great examples of how we are applying new technologies to help BMW technicians work more efficiently and further our commitment to offer the best possible service experience for BMW customers,” said Claus Eberhart, Vice President, Aftersales, BMW of North America. “By solving issues faster, BMW dealers can get customers back into their cars sooner.”
Change For The Better
TSARA is much more efficient than sending in electronic forms or uploading photos, or explaining complex technical issues over the phone. “No … no, right next to that. There’s a notch and I think it has to be … ” will soon be a thing of the past. At least at all 347 BMW and MINI dealerships. And BMW was fiscally smart too, using available, off-the-shelf components like Realwear HMT-1 Smart Glasses and Ubimax Augmented Reality Software. However, despite the new technology, there is still a need for good technicians.
“Vehicle technology is becoming more complex, which only highlights the need for excellent technicians,” said Neal Guthrie, Department Head for Technical Service, BMW of North America. “Hiring top technicians and providing them with the best possible systems and tools with which to work will be critical to our success.”

2019/06/15,2020 Ram 1500 EcoDiesel: A Brief Look At The Changes & Updates,"The 2020 Ram 1500 receives a more powerful EcoDiesel engine. 
Horsepower and torque increase by eight and 14 percent respectively. 
The Italian-built diesel mill will arrive in the fourth quarter of this year.   
The redesigned 2019 Ram 1500 remains a tough, durable, and smooth-riding truck. However, it came to market without the previously optional 3.0-liter diesel V6, more commonly known as the EcoDiesel. But it’s not the end of the world. The Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 and 5.7-liter Hemi are still worthy of praise. However, one can’t help but wonder why Ram is holding back on the EcoDiesel.
Is it a matter of waiting for the right time to strike?
Maybe.
After Ford and GM’s announcement of new light-duty diesel engines, along comes Ram with their V6 EcoDiesel. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. Still, it’s no surprise the 2020 Ram 1500’s new diesel motor is more powerful and torquey than the one it replaces.
The EcoDiesel Has More Power & Torque
Ram uses the same 3.0-liter displacement as before, albeit re-tuned to churn out 260 horsepower and 480 lb-ft. torque. By comparison, the previous EcoDiesel produced 20 less horsepower and 60 lb-ft. less torque. Thank you, Ram (said every diesel truck buyer).
The engine is fitted with a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods. It’s a dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) design with four valves per cylinder and a 60-degree angle between the cylinder banks. Ram opted for a compacted graphite iron block, which weighs less than grey cast iron.
This hike in power is courtesy of lighter aluminum pistons, redesigned intake ports, and new high-pressure fuel injection and EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) systems. Ram also threw in a water-cooled VGT turbocharger with variable vanes. And by changing the compression ratio to 16.0:1 from 16.5:1, Ram was able to coax the EcoDiesel into producing more power at higher engine speeds.
Ram 1500 EcoDiesel: How Does It Compare To Ford & Chevy?
It’s actually pretty good. If the numbers stay where they are, Ram will have the advantage in the torque department for half-ton trucks. The 3.0-liter Power Stroke diesel V6 in the Ford F-150 is good for 250 horsepower and 440 lb-ft. of torque. The Ram 1500 EcoDiesel has 10 more horsepower and 40 more lb-ft. of torque.
On the other hand, the Chevy Silverado’s 3.0-liter Duramax (in-line six) churns out 277 horsepower, which tops the EcoDiesel’s 260 rating. The Duramax Silverado 1500 produces 460 lb-ft. of torque, a healthy number but still 20 lb-ft. shy of the EcoDiesel. When compared to the Duramax Silverado, Ram’s mill has more on the low end.

2020 Hyundai Venue: Practical & Efficient; Did Hyundai Hit a Homer?
There is some variance as to what point these trucks hit their peak torque. For example, the new EcoDiesel produces its peak torque at 1,600 rpm. And while GM’s mill peaks earlier at 1,500 rpm, it does best Ford’s Power Stroke, which comes higher at 1,750 rpm.
The 2020 Ram 1500 Can Move Mountains
Well, not exactly a real mountain but you know what I mean. The point is, this new EcoDiesel will haul like no other with 480 lb-ft. of torque. Having mountains of torque means having the power to move heavy loads. While the Ford F-150 Power Stroke is good for 11,400 lbs. when properly equipped, the 2020 Ram 1500 EcoDiesel has a maximum towing capacity of 12,560 lbs.
I’m not exactly sure how to best visually represent 12,560 lbs. All I can tell you is the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel can tow the weight of four Volkswagen Golfs.

For Work & Play
The good news doesn’t end there for Ram fans. With an innovative coil spring rear suspension and lighter body, the 2020 Ram 1500 straddles the fine line between work, play, and everything between. It still gets the eTorque mild hybrid system for 2020 to improve fuel economy while providing short bursts of power. Ram’s eTorque mild-hybrid powertrain resulted from an extensive redesign of their 1500-series trucks, the changes of which are already on the market for 2019.
However, Ram has yet to reveal fuel economy numbers for the new EcoDiesel – just that they expect to lead the segment.
“The all-new EcoDiesel engine and our eTorque mild-hybrid powertrain technologies deliver the highest available fuel efficiency for our Ram 1500 customers,” said Reid Bigland, Head of Ram trucks.
Ram EcoDiesel: Manufacturing & Availability
The EcoDiesel is a $4,995 option, or a $3,000 premium over the 5.7-liter Hemi ($3,300 on Tradesman, Big Horn/Lone Star, Rebel, and Laramie base models). The Ram Tradesman Quad Cab Diesel 2WD, with a 3.6-liter V6 and the e-torque system, starts at $36,890. Add another $1,695 for destination.
Interestingly enough, this makes it the least expensive diesel half-ton pickup on the market today, and seriously undercuts the base Chevy Silverado 1500 diesel (in the same cab and 2WD configuration) by around $6,000. Meanwhile, the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel also tops the diesel F-150 XLT (also in the same cab and 2WD trim) by almost $7,000. The new Ram diesel also comes with a 5-year/100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty and a standard 3-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper basic warranty.

2019/06/14,2020 Bentley Flying Spur: When Private Jets Don’t Exactly Fly,"The Bentley Flying Spur is one of the most luxurious cars in the world and will remain so. 
Bentley’s hand-built engine is designed to maximize power but minimize cabin intrusion. 
A complete customization program is available for those who want a bespoke Flying Spur. 
Bentley just rolled out the latest version of its Flying Spur and man, does this thing look like the business. Is it just me or has Bentley been getting more racy lately? They seem to be getting in touch with their inner hot-rodder. And yes, the 2020 Bentley Flying Spur is big; yes, it’s heavy and yes, there are more creature comforts than any hot-rodder would consider.
But tell me this thing doesn’t look like it can haul the mail?
Not Your Average Sedan
Let’s get the bad news out of the way first, shall we? The 2020 Bentley Flying Spur is over 16 feet long, just under 6.5 feet wide, and has a wheelbase over three feet longer than a Miata. It’s big, but the worst news is it weighs in at 5,400 lbs. The weight of five Lotus Sevens. Five!
But let’s put that aside.
Bentley Flying Spur: When Private Jets Don’t Exactly Fly
Anybody who owns one of these things is never going to AutoX it (and if you do call me). What you are going to do is cruise the Ville and, on occasion, take it to your weekend place a couple hundred miles from your condo. And the Flying Spur will most assuredly do that, and do so with great aplomb. Try not to think of it as a very luxurious and powerful car, think of it as a private jet that flies very low.
The 2020 Flying Spur rides on a new platform with a combination of aluminium and high-strength steels running throughout the body structure. The car’s lines and surfaces come by way of “aluminium super-forming,” a process first utilized for the new Continental GT. Bentley aficionados may recognize design elements here in the new Flying Spur that hark back to the 1957 S1 Continental Flying Spur.
Here’s a cute feature: “LED matrix headlamps allow the driver to maintain main beam all the time, automatically cutting a hole in the beam around other vehicles to avoid dazzling other drivers.” So cheeky! As if just the mere presence of a Flying Spur would not be enough to dazzle.
[bctt tweet=”Try not to think of it as a very luxurious and powerful car, think of it as a private jet that flies very low.” username=”Automoblog”]
How Powerful Is The Bentley Flying Spur?
Now we get to the good stuff! This beast of a ride is powered by a 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged, direct inter-cooled W12 plant that puts out 626 horsepower and 664 lb-ft. of torque. That is about on par with an ocean-going tug. That is about on par with a Case M Series bulldozer. It’s enough to propel the Flying Spur from a standstill to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, and to a top speed of 207 mph.

Infiniti Just Revealed The Changes To Their Q Lineup For 2020
Bentley’s ‘W’ configuration means the engine is shorter than an equivalent V12 in the interest of cabin space and weight distribution, both essential in a car this big. The engine, hand-built in Crewe, uses the same eight-speed ZF dual-clutch transmission as the Continental GT. Gears seven and eight (i.e. the overdrive ones) are designed for “economic grand touring,” says Bentley.
Torque distribution varies according to the Drive Dynamics Mode program. In Comfort and Bentley modes, over 350 lb-ft. of torque is sent to the front axle to increase grip and handling. By contrast, Sport mode limits front axle torque to about 206 lb-ft., maintaining a higher level at the rear. Power is managed across each axle by Bentley’s torque-vectoring-by-brake system.
Steering & Suspension: “Phenomenal Handling”
The new Flying Spur features Electronic All-Wheel Steering (a first on a Bentley), mated to Bentley’s Active All-Wheel Drive and Dynamic Ride systems. At lower speeds, Electronic All-Wheel Steering guides the rear wheels in the opposite direction of the front ones. This has the effect of shortening the wheelbase and reducing the turning circle. At higher speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the same direction as the front ones to make lane changes more seamless.
For the Dynamic Ride feature, a 48-volt system controls an electronic actuator unit which manages the stiffness of the anti-roll bar, changing it on demand to combat cornering forces and keep the Flying Spur level. When you package the all-wheel steering, all-wheel drive, and dynamic ride systems together, the Crewe company says to expect “phenomenal handling and ride.”
And I’ll agree with them on that.
Suspension is handled via a three-chamber air springs layout that allows you adjust things between a limousine-style ride comfort at one end and sporting at the other. The Flying Spur has the largest iron brakes in the world: 420 millimeters or about the size of a medium pizza. Front and rear calipers carry Bentley branding (natch) and come in gloss black with a gloss red finish optional. Go with the gloss black.
The Royal Treatment
Meanwhile, there you sit in a cabin trimmed with the finest leather, the best handcrafted wood, infotained by systems that would make Alan Turing blush; and cosseted by enough safety and performance systems to ensure your arrival. No need to shout, dear boy. They’ve even worked the exhaust system with an adaptive tailpipe control valve that provides a more discreet note for chauffeur-driven occupants.
The dash is dominated by a high-definition display the size of a laptop screen (12.3 inches). It handles user inputs as well as being reconfigurable to your desires. It can be a single display, split 2:1 or can show three different functions at the same time. It’s really the focal point of Bentley’s Rotating Display which is available for the new Flying Spur. Diamond knurling along the rotary switches, air vents, and clock make for a nice touch of luxury.

All About The Jams
There’s a new Touch Screen Remote for the rear seat passengers as well. It integrates into the console but can be removed for remote use to control a million different things: the blinds, rear seat massage function, rear climate control, and mood lighting. You like music? Then go with the Bang & Olufsen 1,500 watt, 16-speaker system with illuminated grilles; or, if you’re Pete Townshend levels of hearing impaired, opt for the Naim for Bentley 2,200 watt, 19-speaker system with Active Bass Transducers built into the front seats.
There’s Traffic Assist, City Assist and Blind Spot Warning; night vision and a heads-up display to help you focus on the road ahead. The Top View Camera makes parking the big Bentley much easier. That’s if you decide to park yourself, because the new Flying Spur also has a self-parking feature.

Personalization & Availability
And if even that is not enough for you, introduce yourself to Bentley Mulliner Personalization. You don’t buy anything off the rack, why should your Bentley Flying Spur be any different? Exterior colors, interior leather grades and colors; stitching and headliners. The new Flying Spur is as customizable as the drawing room at your weekend place, limited only by your imagination and your (hopefully impressively fat) wallet.
The new Flying Spur is available to order this fall in 17 different colors. Deliveries will begin early next year.

2019/06/12,Mercedes-Benz GLB 250: Small Enough For Families of Seven,"The GLB 250 is the first compact vehicle from Mercedes-Benz to offer an optional third row.
It’s stuffed full of the latest infotainment features, voice command systems, and safety gear. 
An available all-wheel drive system allows for different front-to-rear torque disbursements. 
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB 250 is a mid-sized, no, wait, scratch that it’s a . . . wait, how big is this thing? It looks like a mid-sized crossover, and the specs say it’s not all that big, but somehow Mercedes fits seven seats in this thing with an optional third row. What sort of sorcery is this?
It’s not, really. Just smart packaging by an office full of German engineers. It’s also a pretty good answer if you live in an urban environment, have a family, and also have the cash to drop on something with a three-pointed star on it. They don’t say how much yet, but Merc doesn’t make anything cheap. So figure that in before you decide it’s the car for you.
Or truck. Or truck-like thing.
How Big Is The Mercedes-Benz GLB?
Whatever the GLB is, it’s 111.4 inches long. Which means it’s 5.1 inches longer than the GLA and 1.7 inches shorter than the GLC. Get it? A, B and C. GLA, GLB, and GLC. Right in the Goldilocks zone, or at least the guys in sales hope it is. The headroom up front is 41 inches, and legroom in the back row is 38 inches, meaning the GLB is a comfortable ride for everyone on board (at least the guys in sales say so).
In addition to hauling seven people, the GLB also hauls things. The cargo capacity is between 20 to 62 cubic feet, depending on the model, and whether the seats are all up, all down, or split somewhere between. So family ski trips or camping trips should be handled with ease. Mercedes also points out how the second row backrests can be adjusted in several stages for flexibility, ultimately increasing cargo volume by up to six cubic feet.
Handy if the kids get an extra big haul from granny one Christmas future.

Sound The Trumpet!
The drivetrain has all the bells and whistles you’d expect from this car company in 2019. It’s powered by a two-liter four-banger that puts out respectable amounts of torque and power – 221 ponies and 258 lb-ft. of grunt – being mated to a silky smooth eight-speed automatic. The two-liter M 260 engine (as it’s known in Mercedes parlance) has cast-iron cylinder liners and a die cast aluminum block. Mercedes says their in-house cylinder bore process, called “trumpet-honing,” minimizes piston friction and cuts consumption.

All-Wheel Drive & Torque Distribution
A permanent all-wheel drive system (4MATIC) with variable torque distribution is available too. During normal driving, the Eco/Comfort mode provides an 80:20 distribution (front/rear). While in its off-road setting, the all-wheel drive clutch acts as an inter-axle differential lock, meaning torque distribution ends up as 50:50. In Sport mode, things get really fun with a 70:30 split.
But really, if you’re thinking of seriously owning the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB 250, lap times are not your first priority. Besides, I’ll bet you a beer that an AMG version will be out in about a year or two and then we can talk about lap times.
Hey Mercedes!
No, what you (and your passengers) are going to be most interested in is the infotainment and other tech-wizardry. And of course, there is a metric ton of it, but unfortunately, it’s called MBUX. That stands for Mercedes-Benz User Experience, which just goes to show you when the Japanese come up with a ludicrous name for something, the Germans will say “Halte mein Bier.” Any guy that willfully uses the term MBUX is the same guy that wears socks with his sandals.
Don’t be that guy.
Essentially, it works like this: Anything even remotely connected with infotainment goes through an on-board powerful computer system that then displays relevant info, via screens and graphics. All displays can be customized to your individual needs. There’s a full-color, heads-up display for navigation and augmented reality for the driver. An Alexa-like voice control system activates with a jaunty “Hey Mercedes.”
No word about whether this works for those of you that name their cars. So if you say something like “Hey Bob, show me the route to mom’s place,” I cannot guarantee it will respond.
Related: Mercedes-Benz goes in a different direction with the new GLS.
Safety & Security
There are a bunch of driver assist and safety systems for the Mercedes-Benz GLB. Mercedes says the new GLB has the same “cooperative support for the driver and functionality from the S-Class.” No, I don’t know exactly either, but I take that to mean the GLB has a lot of the same stuff found on the flagship S-Class. For example, the GLB has improved camera and radar systems that can look up to 1,641 feet ahead, and can drive partially autonomously in certain situations. Thanks!
The GLB can alter its speed before corners, crossroads or roundabouts using the Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC system. It references on-board maps and navigation data in addition to what the sensors are telling it. There’s also Active Steering Assist, a new feature, along with Active Lane Change Assist, Active Parking Assist with PARKTRONIC, and some unnamed gizmo that allows the GLB to automatically restart in traffic jams.

Availability & Future Considerations
Look, why mince words here: Mercedes-Benz has forgotten nothing (more or less) and if you are the owner/driver/passenger of/in a GLB, you will want for nothing (more or less). The only real question is how much, which might mean you will be wanting for a fatter bank account, but hey, who doesn’t.
Besides, if you’ve got a family of seven, you’re more than familiar with account balances and such. And you’re more than familiar with what vehicles will do the job and which ones won’t. The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB 250 goes on sale later this year. It’s up to you if it will fulfill what your family needs.

2019/06/10,Volvo Leads New Research To Improve Road Safety For Cyclists,"A new body of research is looking at ways to keep cyclists safer on the road.
Current data shows that fatal accidents involving a bicycle are on the rise.
The study is based on regulatory procedures for pedestrian head protection.
Swedish carmaker Volvo and top Swedish sports and safety brand POC are forming a partnership. We all know Volvo is a stickler for safety, so this comes as no surprise. However, their latest research focuses on protecting cyclists and improving road safety for all. So, how do they do it?
By developing the world’s first car-bike helmet crash test.
The new crash tests are based on current regulatory test procedures for pedestrian head protection. The tests are ongoing at Volvo’s renowned safety research facility in Gothenburg, Sweden.
Setting The Stage
I must admit, I’m not fond of cyclists on the actual road itself because of the safety risk. And I only loathe cyclists who lack discipline or those with no discernible idea about road safety. Otherwise, I have no beef sharing the tarmac with bicycle riders. Our two-wheeled, pedal-powered friends are working for a living just like you and I. They pay their fair share of taxes, and they have every right to hog the bicycle lane. Unfortunately, not everyone has the same warm feelings – I’m looking at you, Clarkson.
If you combine traffic gridlock, deadlines, and a grumbling stomach on the way to work on a cold and drizzly morning, we all know the result is utter chaos. And when you think about it, cyclists are the most vulnerable. A bicycle, for example, doesn’t have bumpers, airbags, or a steel body and chassis to protect the rider.
The latest Volvo and POC research project will benefit both drivers and riders, and will inevitably benefit all consumers in the end. This study will help POC make safer helmets and safety gear. On the other side of the spectrum, the research allows Volvo to develop a new array of vehicle safety features to protect cyclists and pedestrians alike.
“This project with POC is a good example of our pioneering spirit in safety,” said Malin Ekholm, head of the Volvo Cars Safety Centre and one of the company’s leading safety engineers. “We often develop new testing methods for challenging traffic scenarios.”

Road Safety For Cyclists: The Grim Reality
This latest study by Volvo and POC couldn’t have arrived at a better time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 1,000 bicyclists died in 2015, and there were 467,000 bicycle-related injuries in the same timeframe. More troubling are the results of a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the same year. The data shows a declining number in overall bicycle accidents, but there’s a catch: the number of fatal accidents increased by 12 percent.

However, it’s not rosy in other countries like the United Kingdom either. The results of a road casualties report by the UK Department for Transport in 2016 shows cyclists are 15 times more likely to be killed or fatally injured on Britain’s roads than motorists. Considering there are an average of 1.7 million people that cycle to work every day in the UK as of 2017, it’s only timely for Volvo and POC to conduct these deeper studies. One of these is to make a direct comparison between wearing a helmet and not when riding a bike.
Partners In Safety
To date, POC has sixty international awards for safety, innovation, and design. KTH Royal Institute of Technology, MIPS, and Autoliv are also participating in the project, which is partially financed by Vinnova. The results will be made publicly available in time.
“Much like Volvo Cars, safety is at the very center of our mission and drives all our ideas and innovations,” said Oscar Huss, Head of Product Development at POC. “By working closely with scientific leaders in the POC Lab we strive to lead the way in introducing new safety ideas.”
Related: Keeping man’s best friend safe: the science behind pet safety in your car.
The Silver Lining
If you’re a cyclist, then what Volvo and POC are doing will benefit you in the future. In an effort to reduce fatalities and injuries, Volvo will use crash dummy heads wearing POC bike helmets. The dummy is mounted on a testing rig, then launched on different areas of the hood of a stationary Volvo car. The dummy head is thrown at different angles and speeds to gather any necessary and essential data.
“Certification standards are essential,” Huss said. “But they should never limit our willingness to look beyond their parameters to find better and more innovative ways to reduce the consequences of accidents.”
If you compare this with existing bike helmet testing procedures, the old method is as primitive as making tools out of stones and pieces of wood. Manufacturers test bicycle helmets by simply dropping the helmets from differing heights on a flat or angled surface, and that’s it. What’s interesting is how previous test procedures didn’t take into account potential accidents between cars and bicycles, which can exist on the road at any given moment.
Volvo Safety Technologies: Yesterday & Today
Using data from the bicycle helmet crash tests, Volvo can further develop its array of active safety technologies. Chief among those is Cyclist Detection. The system uses the vehicle’s camera and radar to detect cyclists, warning the driver of an imminent collision, and engaging the brakes if necessary. Inevitably, new safety technologies like this will (or should) trickle down to future cars in the interest of public safety. It was, after all, from Volvo that we receive the single greatest passive safety device in history.

Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin developed the three-point safety belt in 1958 after then Volvo president Gunnar Engellau lost a loved one in an accident. Bohlin’s groundbreaking design formed a “V” with the peak facing down to better secure a driver’s upper and lower body. It’s estimated that over one million lives have been saved as a result of Volvo waiving its patent rights.
“Our aim is not only to meet legal requirements or pass rating tests,” Ekholm said. “Instead, we go beyond ratings, using real traffic situations to develop technology that further improves safety.”

2019/06/06,Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Octane Edition: Black Is The New Black,"The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Octane Edition goes for the ever popular “blacked out” look.
Octane Edition Chargers receive a Satin Black center stripe with Octane Red accents on the edges.
The Charger Hellcat is quickest and most powerful sedan in the world with its supercharged Hemi.
Dodge doesn’t do subtle. If cars were firearms, in a world of sniper rifles and machine guns, Dodges would be blunderbusses: crude but highly effective in the short term. The Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat is a good example of this – shoot, anything with the Hellcat moniker qualifies. This latest Charger variant has a new paint scheme as well.
Yeah, it’s just as subtle as the drivetrain.
Plum Crazy Color Schemes
Officially, it’s called the “Charger SRT Hellcat Octane Edition.” It features a “blacked-out” look along with some features not previously available on Charger SRT Hellcats. You can get it any color you want, as long as those two colors are either Pitch Black or White Knuckle. Either color features a full-length, Satin Black center stripe with Octane Red accent tracers on each edge. Good to see Mopar is keeping up the goofy paint names tradition.
Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat: American Iron
Basically this is the same “old” Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, but that still makes it the most powerful sedan on the planet. Yes, something like a BMW M5 would probably beat it around a given track (maybe) (that’s a big maybe), but in terms of acceleration, outright speed, and dyno numbers, you’re looking at the top of the mountain right here.
Yes, there are non-Hellcat and non-Hemi versions available, but would you be interested in those? Us neither. Why? Simple: Good ol’ Murican horsepower and displacement – and lots of both. The supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 puts out 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft. of torque, which is, technically speaking, like putting a suspension on a landmine. Set it off, and you will find yourself some place else in next to no time. That mill is hooked up to a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic tranny with steering wheel shift paddles – one of the few nods to modernity.
There’s a new grille for 2019 that is more than a pretty face. It has dual inlets feeding cooler outside air to the engine bay to strengthen performance. On top of the grille, there are four race-inspired tools now standard on the Hellcat.
Related: Dodge is honoring veterans with these special Chargers and Challengers.
Fabulous Four
First is Launch Assist. This gizmo uses wheel speed sensors to watch for and mitigate any driveline damaging wheel hop at launch. In a matter of milliseconds, Launch Assist modifies the engine torque so you regain full grip. Next comes Line Lock. Old school denizens of The Digs like me know what this is, but in case you don’t, a Line Lock engages only the front brakes so you can hold your car (in this case a Charger SRT Hellcat) stationary, but leave the rear wheels free for a glorious, tire-melting, smoke-producing burnout.

This helps because it heats up the rears and cleans off any gunk.
Number three of the fab four is the After-Run Chiller. This guy keeps cooling the supercharger/charge air cooler after the engine is shut off. Sounds like a good idea, no? And finally, there is Torque Reserve. This closes a bypass valve to pre-fill the supercharger while managing fuel flow and spark advance to balance engine rpm and torque. It works so well that it generates a reserve of torque for delivery upon acceleration. In other words, three-two-one-go! The Hellcat drops all 707 ponies directly onto the pavement, and you are gone baby gone.
Related: Every Mopar muscle enthusiast needs this book.
The Octane Treatment
Assuming any of the competition gets a good look at you, they’ll see how the Octane Edition has this whole “blacked-out” theme goin’ on. There’s black exterior badging for the grille, decklid, and fenders. The decklid spoiler is also Satin Black. The massive 20 x 9.5-inch aluminum-forged Cross Brace wheels are, surprise, painted low-gloss Black.
Yes, you’ll recognize these wheels from the Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320.
The Cross Brace wheels feature knurled bead seats to minimize tire slip on the wheel under extreme acceleration, which on any other car would be superfluous, but seem like a necessity on this one. Yes, it can stop, thankfully. There’s an impressive Brembo brake package with six-piston calipers up front and four-pots at the rear. They are even painted Octane Red.
The interior gets the business with SRT Performance seats and houndstooth inserts, a groovy throwback. The SRT Hellcat logo gets stitched into the seat backs, and there’s red accent stitching throughout the cabin. The instrument panel badge is a black-on-black deal and the seat belts are red. The instrument panel and console bezels are finished in “Dark Brushed II” (obviously better than the Dark Brushed I instrument panel doodads).
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Octane Edition carries an MSRP $1,495. Yes, that is the price for the new appearance package, not the Hellcat itself. Dream on, kid! Plan for at least $68,000 starting for the whole car. However, if you want an Octane Edition, get in line now. It is available for order only through the end of the model year. It will start arriving at Dodge dealerships this fall.

2019/06/06,Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato Concept: When Supercars Head Off-Road,"The Huracán Sterrato Concept takes super car performance and gives it a certain off-road prowess.
Lamborghini is using the Huracán EVO’s 5.2-liter, naturally-aspirated engine for the Sterrato Concept.
No official word from Lamborghini on when (or even if) it will go to market. (Don’t hold your breath).
What is Lamborghini thinking? I know, they kind of do some goofy stuff now and again – I mean, they installed the engine in the Countach backwards – but this; this thing called the Huracán Sterrato Concept, I’m not so sure about it. I guess, conceptually, I’m fine with the idea; shoot, there’s more sport to be found in the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato Concept than in any Sport Utility Vehicle. But . . . really?
The Huracán Sterrato Concept is sort of an off-road/rally version of a Lambo Huracán. Which, okay, in and of itself, does sound kind of fun.
And yes, this is only a concept, so I’d be very surprised if Lamborghini put this into series production, but you never can be too sure.
The Road Already Traveled
The Sant’Agata Bolognese company has done stuff like this in the past, or almost did, at any rate. Back in the 1970s, Lamborghini’s test driver, Bob Wallace himself, modified two of the company’s cars to see how they would work as “desert-going high performance sports cars.” Ergo, the Lamborghini Jarama from 1973 and Urraco from 1974. And given that neither you nor I have ever heard about them until now show you what became of that idea. Yes, indeed, Lamborghini did make an SUV truck, the LM002; and, also yes, they just started making the Urus, but I’d be shocked if the Huracán Sterrato ever ended up in your local Lambo dealership.
As a matter of fact, they say right up front that the Sterrato “draws on Lamborghini’s off-road expertise exemplified in the Urus Super SUV.” Which is kind of cute, calling it a “super” SUV. Not to say that it’s bad, per se, just that the Urus is a mishmash of VAG parts bin stuff with a Lambo badge slapped on (think of it as a Cayenne in an Armani suit).
Based on the admittedly impressive prowess of the V10 Huracán, the Sterrato (which means “dirt” in Italian) uses the Huracán EVO’s 5.2-liter naturally-aspirated 10-pot plant to put out 640 horsepower. An impressive amount on dry pavement to be sure, but one can only speculate what it’s like trying to control all those ponies on gravel or, er, dirt like the name implies. Ah, but not to worry. The ingegnere at Lamborghini are way ahead of us.

Off-Road Calibrations
The Sterrato uses a tweaked version of the Huracán EVO’s LDVI (Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (say that three times real fast)) stability and traction control scheme, with some added predictive logic to control the Sterrato’s systems: four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, the modified suspension, and the torque vectoring system. Lamborghini says the Sterrato will anticipate “the next moves of the driver” to ensure ideal driving dynamics. My hope is the predictive logic predicts correctly and you don’t stuff this thing into the wall of an arroyo.
The Sterrato’s LDVI system is calibrated for off-road driving of all types, including sand, gravel, and the like. It’s tuned to maximize traction and acceleration and, at the same time, provide “enhanced rear-wheel drive behavior.” No, I have no idea either, but I bet anyone driving this beast will discover the full and complete definition of that phrase in no short order. Lamborghini says it produces more torque overall with additional stabilization during maneuvers that cause oversteer.
I take that to mean ‘you should be able to hang the tail way out and still be okay.’ I am not taking their word for it. Not when I will be arguing with 640 horsepower. I’d like to try, but I’m not taking it as an article of faith.
Essential Foundations
The Sterrato’s exterior aims to match the off-road focused drivetrain. Ground clearance is up by 47 millimeters, with the car’s front approach angle up by 1 percent, and the departure angle off the back increased by 6.5 percent. Track width is up both front and rear by 30 millimeters. To serious off-roaders, none of those figures are particularly noteworthy.
The 20-inch wheels are stuffed into wide-body wheel arches that also employ air intakes. The tires have open shoulder blocks for “self-cleaning” and are, according to Lamborghini, damage resistant.
There are numerous body reinforcements and protection measures throughout, including a rear skid plate that doubles as a diffuser. Further aluminum reinforcements reside within the front frame, while the aluminum-reinforced side skirts provide further robustness. Around the engine and air intakes are special stone-deflecting guards, while the inside receives a titanium roll cage.
Future Considerations
Finally, there’s a bunch of off-road LED lights to make you feel like you’re driving the mothership from Close Encounters. But, like I said, the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato Concept is a concept with a capital C. There’s no way they’re going to make this thing and sell it. If they do, call me. Because I know some logging roads that would be an absolute blast to take this thing down.

2019/06/03,Cadillac CT4-V & CT5-V: Meet Two Beautiful (And Powerful) Twins,"The CT4-V and CT5-V are part of a growing family at Cadillac’s performance division. 
Both employ the automaker’s latest engine tech and a special rear-wheel drive platform. 
The 2004 CTS-V was not your grandfather’s Cadillac. With a 5.7-liter V8 churning out 400 horsepower (later a 6.0), this new V-Series car hit 60 mph in about 4.6 seconds. Established in 2002 under the direction of one Ken Morris, Cadillac’s special vehicle performance team was looking to give the luxury marque serious street cred. Armed with a manual transmission, the first CTS-V would get its chance two years later, cutting its teeth on Germany’s famed Nürburgring circuit.
And perhaps, the rest is history?
“From the very beginning, Cadillac’s V-Series represented the ultimate expression of our design, technology, and performance,” said Mark Reuss, GM President. “It introduced an entirely new breed of performance-minded customers to Cadillac showrooms and helped transform the brand’s traditional image into one with different facets for customers’ varying driving tastes.”
Family Matters
The V-Series family tree grew to include five platforms: CTS, XLR, STS, ATS, and CT6, with the branches of that tree still growing. The new CT6-V is a literal monster and an exact beauty; one showcasing the best elements of Cadillac’s now 15-year-long V program. On the heels of the CT6-V come the CT4-V and CT5-V, smaller variants in size but certinately not in stamina or strength. Both are driven by Cadillac’s latest engine tech; both are supported by GM’s rear-wheel drive Alpha architecture; and both utilize Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 with V-Series specific tuning.
Here is a look at the 2020 Cadillac CT4-V and CT5-V. It’s hard to pick a favorite.
“The new lineup expands the V-Series ethos, drawing more customers into the Cadillac Performance family,” Reuss explained. “The newest Vs are focused on elevated athleticism and luxurious refinement for customers wanting a dynamic daily drive.”
2020 Cadillac CT4-V: Engine & Transmission
Indeed, the forthcoming CT4-V will make a great daily driver. It will have a nice, plush interior and plenty of connectivity options; it will be quiet and calm inside – essentially, it will have everything one would reasonably believe a Cadillac should. And under the hood, we have enough for a quick sprint down the on-ramp and for a heart flutter once on the highway. In other words, the 2020 Cadillac CT4-V is a nicely-balanced machine.
Take, for example, the 2.7-liter’s valvetrain which consists of a three-step sliding camshaft and dual-overhead camshaft with four-valves per cylinder; continuously variable valve timing and variable valve lift; and, for good measure, Active Fuel Management (or cylinder deactivation in GM’s parlance). These systems combine to balance performance and fuel economy, all while the driver sits comfortably.

Moving through the in-line four engine we find a single, dual-volute turbocharger (33-psi) with an electronically-controlled waste gate and special cooling system. Downstream is a 10-speed automatic (Hydra-Matic 10L60) with a limited-slip rear differential. All told, the 2020 Cadillac CT4-V dials up 320 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque through a 2.85 final drive ratio. (SAE certification pending as of this writing).
CT4-V: Chassis & Suspension
Up front, the CT4-V rides on a MacPherson-type suspension with dual lower ball joints; at the rear, it’s a five-link independent setup. All-wheel drive variants receive ZF MVS passive dampers and a direct-acting stabilizer bar. By comparison, real-wheel drive variants employ Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 with V-Series-specific calibrations. The V-Series calibration treatments continue over to the electric power steering system.
Related: How magnetic suspensions work and function.
From the factory, the 2020 Cadillac CT4-V will ride on 18 x 8.0-inch aluminum wheels with 235/40R18 summer-only tires. If you opt for all-wheel drive, the CT4-V gets all-season treads. Keeping everything under control is a Brembo front braking system with vented rotors.
2020 Cadillac CT5-V: Engine & Transmission
As we make the jump to the CT5-V, we see more muscle and grunt. The 3.0-liter twin turbo V6 runs low-inertia turbochargers to ensure power delivery across the rpm range. Like the CT4-V, this engine also uses electronically-controlled waste gates, while cooling comes by way of a water-to-air system. Diving deeper, we see the direct-injected V6 has dual-overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder; along with dual-independent valve timing and Active Fuel Management.
The CT5-V’s 10-speed automatic (Hydra-Matic 10L80) links with an electronic limited-slip rear differential. At the end of the day, the 2020 Cadillac CT5-V cranks out 355 horsepower and 400 lb-ft. of torque through a 2.85 final drive ratio. Like the CT4-V, the figures are pending SAE approval, but still. It’s a solid amount of snort.
Keeping The Balance
This is a similar approach as the CT4-V. The idea is to keep an ideal balance between performance and fuel economy, while you as the driver are enjoying the comfort of the cabin. With the connectivity options, a driver can cue up their music and settle in for a long trip; the engine will do its job to maximize mileage but spring to life when extra power is needed, say for passing or climbing a hill.
The CT5-V is an ideal middle ground, in the sense it’s a bit more punchy than the CT4-V but not as aggressive as the CT6-V. Cost-wise, it will land between the two, which has it’s own advantages. An approach like this could serve as the CT5-V’s greatest asset. Yes, it runs more money than the CT4-V, but offers more power. No, it’s not as powerful as the CT6-V, but it’s less money. In this new line of Cadillac V-Series cars, the CT5-V may well be the gem.

CT5-V: Chassis & Suspension
The CT5-V resides on a MacPherson-type front suspension with dual lower ball joints, and a five-link independent setup at the rear. Like the CT4-V, Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 and the electric power steering receive V-Series calibrations. The similarities to the CT4-V make sense, although Cadillac puts emphasis on the stabilizer bars, both front and rear, as essential parts of the CT5-V’s suspension.
Wheels are slightly bigger here: 19×8.5-inch aluminum wheels with 245/40R19 summer-only tires. The Brembo front braking system returns with four-piston fixed calipers and vented rotors.
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
On the technology and safety-front, both are available with Super Cruise. Cadillac’s Super Cruise can automatically steer, brake, and keep the vehicle positioned on the highway in certain, optimal conditions. The system uses high precision LiDAR map and GPS data, an advanced driver attention system, and a network of camera and radar sensors. Cadillac says customers can drive hands-free on more than 130,000 miles of limited-access freeways in the United States and Canada, provided they have an active OnStar plan with emergency services.
In other words, with these two V-Series cars, it’s all about performance; including performance on the technology side of things.
Pricing & Availability
The CT4-V and CT5-V will arrive early next year, with production at GM’s Lansing Grand River facility in Michigan. Exact pricing and additional product information is forthcoming. We are told by Cadillac these two V-Series cars represent “only the beginning” when it comes to what the future holds. With that in mind, we will look to the horizon; in the meantime, we cannot wait to drive the CT4-V and CT5-V.

2019/06/02,2020 Lexus RX & RXL: A Brief Yet Detailed Walk Around,"The RX and RXL receive a number of updates, many of them on the tech front.
Driving enthusiasts will appreciate the addition of two new F SPORT packages. 
The 2020 Lexus RX and RXL (fancy SUVs to you and me) get a thorough revamp for the new year. You can’t really say it’s a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Lexus has redone this luxo-crossover across the board and the improvements are noticeable. The best way to distinguish between the two is how the RXL is a little longer and – most important if you have a large family – comes with a third row of seats.
Other than that, they are quite similar in terms of form, function, safety, and technology.
Styling & Design (Maybe Slightly Overboard)
For 2020, the front and rear fascias are updated to bring the RX and RXL in-line with the rest of the brand’s look. Both have Lexus’ signature grille, and lots of “individual blocks” strewn across the overall form to give a balance of sophistication and strength and blah-blah-blah. Lexus goes on and on about this, but it doesn’t really matter much to me. Lexus has been off in their own design direction for a while now, and I worry they might never come back.
But let’s not talk too much about subjective things like styling, shall we. The meat of the RX and RXL is more than a strong enough selling point.
Yakety Yak (It Will Probably Talk Back)
Take all of the on-board tech, for example. Standard on all models are the latest smartphone integrations and their respective virtual assistants. The standard eight-inch touchscreen is for messing with everything tech-related, like the Lexus Enform Remote system (you get a three-year trial period). This remotely starts the vehicle using your smartphone, handy to have when it gets cold.
There are six USB ports throughout the RX and RXL, so everybody’s devices stay charged. Of course both are fully compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The newest Lexuses (Lexi?) also have voice services like Amazon Alexa, so you can just yack at the Lexus Multimedia System, and it’ll start playing your favorite road trip playlist or start navigating you home.
Passengers (Lexus insists on calling them “Guests” which is kind of annoying) can choose between the standard eight-inch display, or an available 12.3-inch high-resolution, split-screen multimedia display. Going further yet is Dynamic Voice Command, which Lexus says recognizes “millions more phrases” than their conventional systems.
Safety & Security
Safety? Of course a vehicle of this stripe will have enough safety stuff to make Ned Flanders sleep like a baby. There’s Lexus Enform Safety Connect and Enform Service Connect along with the Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 as standard equipment. This gives you stuff like daytime bicyclist detection, low-light pedestrian detection, Road Sign Assist, and Lane Tracing Assist. The Pre-Collision System can detect bicyclists and pedestrians in low-light situations.
Lane Tracing Assist also works in conjunction with the All-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control and, in certain conditions, follows the car ahead of you. The Road Sign Assist gizmo displays road sign information in the instrument panel, which I don’t really see the efficacy of.

Essential Foundations
The 2020 Lexus crossovers get several updates to improve driving dynamics. The front and rear stabilizer bars are thicker, yet hollow to cut weight. They have reinforced bushings to reduce body roll and improve steering response. The shocks are re-tuned (natch) and feature a new friction control device to manage “high frequency vibrations,” meaning the RX and RXL should provide a smoother ride. The stiffer suspension reduces the overall noise and vibration from the road, Lexus says. And finally, active corner braking prevents understeer by clamping down on the inner tire.
If you want your RX or RXL with a hybrid drivetrain, that’s on offer as well. These are either the RX 450h or RX 450hL and serve up a combined 308 total system horsepower. For fuel economy, Lexus estimates 30 and 29 combined for the RX and RXL respectively. The ICE part of the hybrid system is a 3.5-liter V6 gasoline mill with two high-torque, electric drive motor/generators in the mix. The all-weather drive system employs a trick second independent electric motor to push the rear wheels when needed for optimal traction.

F SPORT Treatments
If you’d like things a little more athletic and sporty than eco-conscious, the 2020 Lexus RX offers two F SPORT packages. The regular F SPORT package offers “the look” with additional tuning for a more muscular feel on the road. It includes a cold air intake (very Fast & Furious), active sound control, electric power steering, and a heated steering wheel. There are front and rear “performance dampers” and a Drive Mode Select system with Sport+ (very, very Fast & Furious).
By comparison, the RX F SPORT package includes an active variable suspension, which Lexus says is more responsive than prior systems. That active variable suspension is also borrowed from the mighty Lexus LC. Oh, and the RX F SPORT has Circuit Red seating with grey stitching on the seams.
No word yet on what the 2020 F SPORT packages will return for fuel economy. The current Lexus RX 350 F SPORT gets an EPA-estimated 19/26 city/highway and 22 combined mpg.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Lexus RX and RXL will start production in the third quarter of 2019. Pricing information is forthcoming. The current Lexus RX 350 starts at $43,820 with front-wheel drive; $45,220 with all-wheel drive. The current three-row RX 350L starts at $47,870 with front-wheel drive and $49,270 with all-wheel drive.

2019/05/30,2020 MINI John Cooper Works Clubman & Countryman: An In-Depth Look,"The 2020 MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and Countryman receive a more powerful engine.
Updates to the all-wheel drive system and transmission increase overall performance and agility.
Based on the available data, the new John Cooper Works variants look like they are a blast to drive.
Some of the fine yet crazy engineers at BMW, MINI’s parent company, decided to have a seriously unhinged go at the latest John Cooper Works variants, the Clubman and Countryman. They tweaked the chassis and other such bits, but all that is kind of beside the point when you look at what they did to the engine. The new four-cylinder uses BMW’s patented TwinPower Turbo technology to crank out a staggering 301 horsepower and 331 ft-lb. of torque.
2020 MINI John Cooper Works: Power Jumps & Faster Times
No, overall, those aren’t huge numbers, but in a car this small, and from only a 2.0-liter engine, they are massive. In case you’re interested, that’s a 73 horsepower bump over the previous version – which, in and of itself, is an impressive jump. The new MINI John Cooper Works Clubman hits 62 mph in 4.9 seconds, 1.4 seconds faster than the previous model; the new Countryman hits 62 mph in 5.1 seconds, 1.5 seconds faster than the outgoing version. Also – if I’m remembering this right – the Clubman and Countryman are two of the heaviest MINIs you can get. Imagine this same drivetrain in the smallest, lightest one they make?
Anyway, back to the engine.
Component Revisions & Compression Ratio Drops
The engine is based on the 2.0-liter from the MINI Cooper S Clubman and Countryman but with model-specific modifications. For example, BMW was able to get this big jump in power by reinforcing the crankshaft, and extending the cross-section of the main bearing. The John Cooper Works models receive special con-rods and pistons, and a new “vibration damper with optimized cooling.” I know. Does that mean the engine cooling has been redone, or does that mean they have optimized the cooling for the vibration damper? It has to be the first one, right?
Tell me this thing isn’t somehow thermally overloading the vibration dampers.
Since the model’s turbo is bigger, the compression ratio drops from 10.2 to 9.5 – think about it for a bit and you’ll understand why. On top of that, the turbocharger is integrated in the exhaust manifold and fitted with a blow-off valve to increase responsiveness. The air intake duct has also been reworked, or as MINI puts it, “de-throttled” as far as possible. MINI’s new direct injection system uses multi-hole fuel injectors, arranged between the valves to increase flow rate. In short, the injectors produce better vaporization and higher pressures for cleaner combustion and greater efficiency.

And, since this is a BMW engine, fully-variable valve control (similar to BMW Group’s VALVETRONIC system) and variable camshaft control (like BMW’s VANOS) are helping things along.
Related: The car built for everyone: walking through MINI’s history.
Keeping It Cool
The cooling system is completely new as well, with a focus on optimum running temperature for the engine, even at the track. There are two external radiators, a model-specific expansion tank with increased volume, an independent cooling module mounting, an electric ventilator (also with higher output), and a condenser. The transmission has its own cooling circuit and external oil cooler. If you read between the lines, this essentially says: This engine runs hotter than a pistol! It might be worrisome in the future (Lord knows how long a little engine squeezed this hard can stand up to the pressures and temperatures) but why worry about it while it’s under warranty?
The bad news is that speed is electronically-limited to 155 mph. Which is, let’s face it, really fast for a car the size of a stove. But also: BOO, speed limiters, boo I say!!
Transmission Tech: Autocross Here We Come!
Ah yes, the transmission. All that power and torque hits the pavement through an eight-speed Steptronic transmission. A new control unit increases the gear shift dynamics and driving comfort, so says MINI. The steering wheel features shift paddles for manual gear selection. Yay! And even more yay: there’s a launch function. AutoX and rally stages here I come!
This new transmission features a mechanical differential lock for the front wheel. According to MINI, it functions transversely to reduce the speed compensation between the front wheels. Under load conditions, this tallies up a locking effect of 39 percent MINI says. It essentially works like this: Should one tire begin to spin, the locking effect transfers the torque to the other wheel to increase traction. It’s also worth pointing out the diff is interconnected with the Dynamic Stability Control (DCS) to aid traction on loose terrain, or in poor weather conditions. If you are on the track, it’s useful when accelerating out of a corner.
Related: It was a time of peace, rejuvenation, and tiny cars. And the MINI ruled.
All-Wheel Drive: Configuration & Layout
It’s no surprise the new John Copper Works variants are all-wheel drive. This makes sense, because think about putting over 300 horsepower through just the front wheels. The torque steer would be lethal! The all-wheel drive system, known simply as “ALL4” is compact and weight-optimized, according to MINI. A power take-off resides on the front axle’s transmission, with a two-section prop-shaft in the middle, and an electro-hydraulically regulated clutch at the rear. Did you get all that? The ALL4 system’s controller also works with the DSC; because what other way would a bunch of German engineers do it?
RELATED
2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD: Dashing Through The Snow
Similar to how the locking effect works in the transmission, if the DSC controller detects front wheel slip, within a fraction of a second, the hang-on clutch will transfer torque to the rear wheels via the electro-hydraulic pump. Bottom line: engine power is always channeled to the corner that needs it most. Now, combine this with the long wheelbase and low center of gravity; reinforced body structure and larger air inlets; new swivel bearings to improve camber values on the front wheels; and increased spring rates for the engine and transmission bearings, and you have a MINI that is a blast to drive.
Pricing & Availability
There is a full suite of modern infotainment goodies in the cabin, but really, I don’t care. The only thing that really matters about these John Cooper Works variants is all that power, and how it gets to the ground quickly, effortlessly, and efficiently.
Oh sure, performance like this costs money, but like other recent John Cooper Works variants, this is really affordable performance. The 2020 John Cooper Works Clubman starts at $39,400 with the Countryman coming in at $41,400. Tack on another $850.00 for destination and handling. Expect the new John Cooper Works Clubman and Countryman later this summer.

2019/05/24,2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport: Mild-Hybrid Systems & Cool Cameras,"The 2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport receives new exterior treatments.
A new mild hybrid system increases acceleration and overall performance.
When it arrives later this summer, the Discovery Sport will come in 12 colors.
One particular on-board camera really takes the cake, and is useful for off-roading. 
The previous model Land Rover Discovery Sport is a conundrum. It does offer a nice blend of everyday utility and off-road ruggedness, but the cabin pales in comparison to other compact luxury SUVs like the Volvo XC60, Audi Q5, and Mercedes-Benz GLC. However, the 2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport is set to change that, and will draw on its legacy in doing so.
Land Rover says they will continue “embracing the adventurous spirit” that has defined their brand, and the 2020 Discovery Sport is the next step in that process.
“Discovery Sport has been a real sales success for Land Rover, leading the way for the past three years and selling almost half a million vehicles to date,” explained Felix Brautigam, Chief Commercial Officer, Jaguar Land Rover. “During that time, it has won a number of awards and introduced a large number of new, younger families into the brand who are looking for something different.”
2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport: What’s New
The changes are not readily noticeable at first glance, but Land Rover claims the new Discovery Sport is more practical and convenient than before. The new Disco Sport retains the familiar design cues of the original Discovery with a clamshell hood, rising beltline, and a tapering roof. The SUV receives new front and rear bumpers, a new grille design, and more modern LED headlights.
The interior also benefits from a major overhaul. The center console now houses a 10-inch display while the steering wheel has capacitive switches for a more luxurious feel. Third-row passengers have access to cup holders while the rest get wireless charging, and USB and 12-volt ports.
A View From Down Under
The new Disco Sport comes with the ClearSight Ground View system. This technology is as useful as it is breathtaking. It gives the driver a 180-degree view of the ground beneath the vehicle, useful for tackling rough terrain. By projecting that imagery on the center display, drivers have a better idea of what exactly is under them when traveling off-road. The new Disco Sport also inherits the ClearSight Rear View system from the Evoque. This technology transforms the rearview mirror into an HD video screen via a rear-facing camera.
Without a doubt, the new Land Rover Discovery Sport is rugged to the core, but it’s now inching closer to Range Rover territory in terms of practicality, refinement, and luxury features.

Spacious & Eco-Friendly Interior
We’re still talking about a compact luxury SUV and not a full-size land yacht here, so it’s best to curb your expectations. However, all things considered, the new Discovery Sport is home to a spacious and comfortable interior. The new Disco Sport has a 13 percent stiffer body and a more rigid subframe. This helps reduce vibration and harshness inside the cabin for a softer, more comfortable ride. The third-row seats are roomy enough to accommodate vertically-challenged adults on short journeys, while the second-row seats now split 40:20:40.
In fact, the flexible seating arrangement in the new Disco Sport allows you to split, fold, and slide to produce up to 24 seating combinations (let the games begin!). Even the front seats have a massaging feature.
New for the 2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport is Luxtex. It’s not leather, but it feels luxuriously soft and is more durable and tear-resistant than the genuine item. Luxtex is made from recycled polyester microfiber and is more sustainable and Earth-friendly than cowhide.
Electrified Performance: Mild-Hybrid Powertrain
The 2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport is also sporting a new mild-hybrid powertrain. If there’s one thing we don’t like about the prior Disco sport, it’s the less-than-stellar fuel economy. This new mild-hybrid powertrain will hopefully address this concern while giving the SUV a slight boost in power and torque.
The mild-hybrid design utilizes a belt-integrated starter generator that literally harvests energy when you lift off the gas pedal. The electrons are stored in a 48V battery, tucked neatly under the floor while a DC converter provides power to the 48V and 12V systems of the vehicle.
The result of all this is 296 horsepower and greater low-end torque when combined with the Ingenium gasoline motor. This is more than what the high-output motor in the previous model can muster. Meanwhile, the non-electrified version is good for 246 horsepower; also more than the standard 2.0-liter turbocharged motor in the outgoing Disco Sport.
Towing & Terrain Response
Land Rover will most likely retain the nine-speed automatic from the previous model. Of course, no Land Rover is complete without a ruggedly-capable all-wheel drive system. The SUV’s Terrain Response feature is another bonus, which automatically detects the surface below and adjusts the vehicle’s driving character accordingly. This makes for a nice paring when considering the ClearSight Ground View system.
Overall, the new Disco Sport has elevated levels of performance when facing harsh and demanding off-road scenarios. Maximum wading depth comes in at 23.6 inches and, when properly equipped, the new Discovery Sport tows up to 4,409 lbs.

Numerous Exterior Options
The 2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport is available in 12 colors. Buyers can choose a contrasting black roof as well, and there are 10 wheel designs across four sizes from 18 to 21 inches. The optional Black Exterior Pack adds black detailing on the grille, fender vents, hood, and tailgate letters. It’s not as bespoke as a Rolls-Royce or Bentley, but this allows potential buyers to further customize their new Disco Sport.
2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport: Pricing & Availability
Land Rover has yet to announce pricing on the new Discovery Sport. We’re still expecting around $40,000 for the base model, complete with a bevy of standard luxury and convenience features. Right now, the 2019 Land Rover Discovery Sport starts just shy of $38,000. Deliveries to U.S. retailers of the 2020 model will commence this summer.

2019/05/23,This 2020 BMW M5 Celebrates 35 Years of Bavarian Goodness,"A forthcoming special edition celebrates 35 years of the BMW M5.
However, production is limited to 350 units globally with 35 for the U.S.
More than a looker, this special 2020 BMW M5 can reach nearly 200 mph. 
The BMW M5 is celebrating 35 glorious years of sport-luxury driving. Commemorating this event is the 2020 BMW M5 Edition 35 Years. Yeah, it’s quite a mouthful. However, this special version of the M5 Competition is limited to 350 units globally, and only 35 will make it to the U.S.A.
Better act quickly, then.
BMW M5 Edition 35 Years: What’s New?
Think of it as a cosmetic makeover rather than an invasive surgical procedure. BMW started with the impressive M5 Competition and went from there. All 35 examples of the M5 Edition 35 Years have “BMW Individual Frozen Dark Grey II” metallic paint (another mouthful). It features a special pigment to exude a silky, matte finish, according to BMW. The gloss-black brake calipers peek out from under those gorgeous, 20-inch alloy wheels with their graphite gray finish.
Enhancing the stealthy look is the absence of traditional badges on the trunk.
The interior receives the 35-year treatment too. For example, the M Sport seats are covered in Merino Black leather with beige stitching. Garnering attention are the door trim sections, instrument area, and center console with a gold anodized carbon structure finish. It all looks classy and modern inside the BMW M5 Edition 35 Years.

Optional M5 Packages
The 2020 BMW M5 Edition 35 Years is available in two themes: Executive and the M Driver’s Package. The former throws in a surround view system with a 3D camera and active park distance control, soft-close automatic doors, power rear and side rear window sunshades, ventilated front seats, heated front and rear seats, four-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth, and wireless charging.
In the meantime, the M Driver’s package raises the speed limiter from 155 to 189 mph. You also get a voucher for some high-performance driving lessons at the BMW Performance Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina or Thermal, California.
No matter which package you choose, this special M5 receives a 12.3-inch instrument cluster display and a 10.25-inch center touchscreen display. The latest version of the BMW iDrive 7 operating system with Live Cockpit Professional is also included. Of course, this special M5 also receives the iDrive touch controller with gesture control and cloud-based voice control.
High-Revving Powerplant
This means a turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 generating 617 horsepower and 553 lb-ft. of torque. No, the 2020 BMW M5 Edition 35 Years is no more powerful than the M5 competition, but this cuts both ways. Seriously, is 617 horsepower not enough for a sport-luxury barge? However, since this M5 pays tribute to 35 years of dominance, would it hurt BMW to sweeten the deal with more oomph under the hood?

It depends on how you look at it.
With this motor, the M5 Edition 35 Years rockets from zero to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, with 124 mph arriving in just 10.8 seconds. I can think of no faster way to complete a school or grocery run, barring a steroidal supercar.
All-Wheel Drive Technology
Keeping everything under control is the M xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive system. It includes an active differential with a fully-variable and electronic multi-plate clutch. This ensures immediate power transfer from the engine to the driving wheels. Torque is split between the front and rear wheels by the multi-plate clutch, before the Active M Differential splits it again (as necessary) between the rear wheels. Interestingly enough, this innovative AWD system is capable of operating purely in rear-wheel drive.
In my humble opinion, this is the FUN setting, and basically means you can do powerful burnouts and huge power slides – all in a comfortable, dignified, and luxurious environment.

Performance Suspension & Powerful Brakes
The 2020 BMW M5 Edition 35 Years is seven millimeters lower than the plebeian M5 sedan. This is due to 10 percent stiffer springs and dampers. Meanwhile, the special edition M5 makes good use of a double-wishbone front and five-link rear suspension with a firmer rear anti-roll bar. This helps lessens body roll while giving the vehicle a rear-biased feel.
Stopping power is courtesy of lightweight, six-piston fixed calipers with inner-vented disks in the front and single-piton floating calipers in the rear.
Pricing & Availability
Only 35 examples of this special M5 are allocated to U.S. buyers. Production begins in September with prices starting at $128,995 (including destination and taxes).

2019/05/21,McLaren GT: A Brief Walk Around This Unique Grand Touring Car,"The McLaren GT is an entirely new model and the brand’s first true grand touring car.
To increase everyday ease of use, braking and steering were optimized for lower speeds.
Although intended for long distance driving, the new McLaren GT is still quick as lightning. 
McLaren has been on a roll lately, as far as street cars are concerned. They are looking at expanding in a certain way as a company. No, they are not going to make an SUV or a crossover. Perish the thought. No, for a while now, they have been talking about producing a more comfortable long distance tourer versus a track day superstar. Looks like they made good on all that talk, because the new McLaren GT just rolled out.
A Little More Lumbar Support
Track-focused, decontented, performance uber alles sports cars are a complete blast. I should know, I own one. But have you ever tried to drive one for a long distance, say from one side of the country to the other? Believe me, about the middle of day two, you’ll start to think heretical thoughts like, “Maybe a little more lumbar support wouldn’t be such a bad thing.” It was that kind of thought process (I bet) that led McLaren to make their new GT. While still a potent car of impressive performance capabilities, it has some niceties spread throughout to make long journeys much more of a paying proposition.
McLaren GT: By The Numbers
Before we get to the practicalities, here’s the fun stuff: 612, 465, 3.1, 9.0 and 203. Or, in context, the new 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 engine cranks out 612 horsepower and 465 lb-ft. of torque; which can scoot you and a friend and your stuff to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds. Zero to 124 mph happens in nine seconds, with a top speed of 203 mph. More than 95 percent of the GT’s torque is available from 3,000 to 7,250 rpm and dispersed to the ground via a seven-speed SSG transmission.
McLaren uses terms like “linear, seamless, and relentless acceleration” and I’m not going to argue. Tally up those numbers and the power-to-weight ratio of the McLaren GT is a remarkable 399 horsepower-per-ton.
New From The Ground Up
The McLaren GT is the fourth new model introduced under the company’s Track25 business plan. The Grand Tourer (or GT) is not just a 700S or some-such with more bells and whistles. With the McLaren GT, everything is new: the chassis, engine, bodywork, everything. At over 15 feet, the McLaren GT is longer than any Sports or Super Series model, although the company says the GT shares the Speedtail’s DNA, which I don’t exactly see. It does have that long tail form factor, but from certain angles it seems clunky. The rear section in particular comes off as boxy and ill-fitting.

2021 VW Atlas: Quick But Detailed Overview
Let’s just put it this way: An Italian wouldn’t design a car like this.
Load Up The Clubs
Where it does succeed – which is where it aims to succeed the most – is in being practical and usable. Total cargo capacity is 20.1 cubic feet with a full-on rear luggage bay (i.e. trunk) accessed via the full-length rear tailgate. You know, just like on a normal car. And yes, that tailgate is electrically-powered if you want to tick the option box accordingly. McLaren says the rear boot has room for bags, skis, and golf clubs if you’re one of those nut-jobs that thinks chasing around a little white ball counts as “fun.”
So you don’t damage the cargo area loading up your gear, a special trim called SuperFabric is optional. It lines the rear luggage bay and is infused with a layer of tiny armored guard plates to resist stains, cuts, and abrasions.
Built For Everyday Usability
Ensuring a smooth yet sporting ride (which is literally true in this case, not just some mumbo-jumbo advertising copy from a 1981 Pontiac brochure) is the new Proactive Damping Control suspension system. The new chassis provides remarkable levels of comfort, and combines with the hydraulic steering system to deliver McLaren-level driving dynamics and control. McLaren has gone so far as to optimize the braking and steering at lower speeds for everyday use. The ride height and ground clearances are engineered for urban usability, which is a nice way of saying you won’t approach a speed bump like an old man approaches a flight of metal-edged stairs.
Interior Treatments
The infotainment system is also new and is McLaren’s most sophisticated to date, according to the company. It features HERE navigation mapping and real-time traffic information. The interface operates like a smartphone via the seven-inch central touchscreen when selecting functions like satellite navigation, Bluetooth, media streaming, and voice activation. The touchscreen also handles the heating and ventilation so the overall number of switches is minimized.
The stereo is a 12-speaker, Bowers & Wilkins system with carbon fiber sub-bass woofers and Kevlar mid-range drive units. Sirius satellite radio in North America is standard, which should nicely compliment the Bowers & Wilkins setup.
Nappa leather is standard, with softgrain luxury leather or Alcantara available as upgrades. A special Cashmere trim will become available towards the end of the year. Either way, the electrically-adjustable and heated seats of the McLaren GT provide more padding for better shoulder and back support for long distance driving.

2019/05/17,2020 Toyota Supra: The Best Toyota Sports Car?,"The 2020 Toyota Supra is the first Supra in the United States in 21 years. 
Toyota GAZOO Racing applied their vision when engineering the new Supra. 
Expect the Supra in July with a fairly reasonable MSRP considering the performance. 
Much has been said about the fifth-gen, 2020 Toyota Supra. We all know how the Supra is a rehashed version of the new BMW Z4, but that’s not exactly right.
And while we’re still left pondering on the fine line between Toyota and BMW sports cars, I think it’s time to stop comparing the Supra to the Z4 and try looking at it from a different perspective.
Setting The Stage
Yes, the BMW has a more powerful version of the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, and I was among the first to voice my opinion on this matter. Toyota claims the new Supra has a stiffer and more rigid chassis than the Lexus LF-A, and that’s saying a lot. Honestly, if the supposedly inferior chassis of the LF-A can handle a stonking 4.8-liter V10 motor with 560 horsepower, what’s holding back Toyota from giving the Supra more oomph?
When you think about it, my arguments are valid. But then again, I’m acting based on emotion. From a more technical and tangible perspective, I’m beginning to think the 2020 Toyota Supra is the best Toyota sports car yet; and this is despite the things I find wrong with it – which I’ll be talking more about in a bit.
2020 Toyota Supra: Out With The Old
Naturally, I’m expecting the new Supra to be faster and more agile than the previous-gen A80 Supra. The new model has approximately 15 more horsepower than the 2JZ-GTE, and it also has a lighter body. The old Supra had semi-functional rear seats while the new model is strictly a two-plus-two, so I think the new Supra is more of a proper sports car than the old model. I can’t help but think if Toyota purposely went out of its way to wimp out the new Supra to, perhaps, glorify the Z4. I know it sounds ridiculous and that would be totally missing the point.
Let’s look at the nearest competitor of the Supra: the Nissan Skyline GT-R. Before the sixth-gen GT-R came bashing in with its 565 horsepower, turbocharged V6 motor, the fifth-generation Skyline with the RB26DETT inline-six only had 330 horsepower in stock form. That’s a huge jump! And now, the Nissan GT-R is regarded by many as a proper supercar.
Admittedly, I was expecting the new Supra to do the same. Instead, Toyota is talking about balance and how you don’t need a gazillion horsepower to have fun. The funny thing is, they’re right.
[bctt tweet=”@Toyota is talking about balance with the #Supra and how you don’t need a gazillion horsepower to have fun.” username=”Automoblog”]
Power When You Need It Most
It’s foolish to talk about the Supra’s new inline-six motor without paying homage to the iconic 2JZ-GTE. That engine catapulted the Fast and the Furious movie franchise to dizzying heights. If you had an A80 Supra back in the day, not even a Porsche 911 Turbo 3.6 is fast enough to catch up, and we’re talking stock versus stock.

Naturally, Supra fans were expecting a revival of the 2JZ-GTE. I wouldn’t bat an eyelash if Toyota shoehorned a proper Japanese motor in the Supra for obvious reasons. But instead, the new Supra gets a BMW-derived 3.0-liter, turbocharged inline-six with continuously variable valve timing and direct fuel injection. It produces 335 horsepower and 365 lb-ft. of torque, which sounds measly compared to the 382 horsepower in the BMW Z4.
But with an eight-speed automatic and active differential between the rear wheels, the 2020 Toyota Supra is no slouch. In fact, it is faster than expected. Depending on grip levels and weather conditions, the new Supra can rocket from zero to 60 mph in 3.8 to 4.1 seconds. It scoots towards the quarter-mile in 12.3 seconds.
When you think about it, these performance numbers are inching towards the Chevrolet Corvette, BMW M2 Competition, and Porsche Cayman GTS. The new Supra is basically a muscle car at heart!
Sporty Stance & Precise Handling
The 2020 Toyota Supra has the styling elements of the FT-1 Concept, albeit in a more subdued manner. Thankfully, the production model retains those bulbous rear haunches to give the new Supra an aura of sophistication. Although beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I think the new Supra looks cleaner in the rear.
Toyota GAZOO Racing envisioned the new Supra as having a perfect 50:50 weight distribution, and a lower center of gravity. As a result, the Supra today is riding on a new, double-joint spring front suspension with aluminum control arms. The rear consists of a multi-link rear setup with steel and aluminum components. All Supra models have variable-assist and variable ratio, sport-tuned electric power steering and an adaptive variable suspension.
In order to enhance grip, the wheels and tires in the rear are wider. Those 19-inch forged alloys come with 255/35R19 Michelin Pilot Super Sport Tires in the front, and 275/35/R19 in the rear.
2020 Toyota Supra Trim Levels
The 2020 Supra is available in two grades: 3.0 and 3.0 Premium. Both models have the same powertrain. The difference is on the inside. The lower 3.0 grade has Alcantara seats and a 6.5-inch center display with Bluetooth and iPod connectivity. Options include a navigation system and premium JBL audio for an additional $2,400. The Supra 3.0 starts at $49,990.
The Supra 3.0 Premium gets a larger, 8.8-inch touchscreen display with navigation, Apple CarPlay (no Android Auto at the moment), a 12-speaker JBL audio system, heated leather seats, wireless charging, Supra Connect telematics services, and a color heads-up display. This model starts at $53,990.

Convenience & Safety Features
Standard on both is a leather-wrapped steering wheel, keyless smart entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, rain-sensing wipers, rear camera, power-folding mirrors, and auto-dimming rearview mirrors. The new Supra comes with a bevy of standard safety features, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high beams. The Driver Assist Package is optional and includes blind spot monitoring, full-speed adaptive cruise control, rear cross traffic alert, and parking sonar.
There’s also a Supra Launch Edition at $55,250. This model comes with red mirror caps, 19-inch forged matte black alloy wheels, carbon fiber interior accents, and a red or black-themed cabin.
Color My World
There’s no doubt the 2020 Toyota Supra is still a fun sports car, and the paint colors make it even more so. The palette includes Renaissance Red 2.0, Downshift Blue, Phantom Matte Gray, and Nitro Yellow. If you wish for a more subdued look, go for Absolute Zero White, Nocturnal Black, Turbulence Gray, or Tungsten Silver.
Things We Don’t Exactly Like
There aren’t many, but we have a few caveats. First is the non-availability of a proper manual transmission. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure the eight-speed automatic is a delight to drive.
However, if Toyota gave the 86 a six-speed manual, would it hurt for the Supra to get one too?
Next is the interior. It pretty much resembles the cockpit of a BMW. This is not a deal breaker for most people, but many of the buttons and switchgear are clearly out of place in a Japanese sports car. More worrying are the expected maintenance costs given the nature of a car like the Supra. The Toyota name is known for two things: reliability and durability. Admittedly, it will be interesting to see if the new Supra lives up to the bulletproof reliability of the brand. We will find out when it goes on sale in July.
Future Considerations
Despite all this, the 2020 Toyota Supra is probably the best Toyota sports car ever made. It’s not the all-conquering hyper beast we’ve come to expect, nor is it the prettiest or the most exclusive among exotic sports cars. Yet, the Toyota Supra is still properly quick and agile without giving the driver an overwhelming sense of danger. It delivers the type of balance that normal drivers can enjoy each time behind the wheel.
And at the end of the day, isn’t this what we want from a Japanese sports car?

2019/05/16,2020 Hyundai Sonata: Right On The Money (Again),"The 2020 Hyundai Sonata strikes an ideal balance between performance and price.
A range of interior technology helps drivers stay connected on their daily commute.
Two engines are available and both return an EPA-estimated 30 plus mpg combined. 
Hyundai debuted the 2020 Sonata earlier this year at the New York International Auto Show. Whatever it brings to the table this time you better get used to it, because you’re going to be seeing a lot of these things around. Hyundai figured out the sweet spot for this a while back, and they have been honing it and refining it ever since. Like I said, get used to seeing a lot of Hyundais around, in particular the 2020 Hyundai Sonata.
Right On The Money
The sweet spot, in this case, is the convergence of style, available features, and above all, price. Somewhere along the way, Hyundai figured out how to make good cars that are right on the money with current automotive design trends; and without a high cost for the consumer. Think of Hyundai as a near-fashion brand knock-off. You’ll look great and a la mode, and by this time next season (i.e. when your lease expires) you can get rid of your old look for what’s contemporary but not break the bank.
“Sonata is our signature product,” explained Mike O’Brien, Vice President, Product, Corporate and Digital Planning, Hyundai Motor America. “Having been one of our first and most successful nameplates, Sonata is our legacy, and it needs to be special and memorable in all attributes.”
“The new-generation Sonata is a fully transformed vehicle packed with advanced personalization technology, a new platform, and an array of ADAS technologies,” added Albert Biermann, President of Hyundai Motor Group’s R&D Division. “We are confident that our customers will be pleasantly surprised by this innovative new model.”
Design Language: Contemporary Yet Pleasant
The 2020 Sonata embodies Hyundai’s “Sensuous Sportiness” design language with a “sophisticated four-door-coupe look,” or so says the company. Besides all the buzz words and corp. speak, you can look at the 2020 Sonata’s design like this: it’s pleasant, contemporary, and it’s impression will fade over time. Seriously, no Google’ing “what does a 2010 Hyundai Sonata look like?” We’ll be in the same spot in 2030 trying to describe Hyundai’s “Sensuous Sportiness” design language.
Now, I’m not saying Hyundai is incapable of having original designs – just look at the concepts they roll out at auto shows every so often. What I am saying is Hyundai is more interested in manufacturing cars that do three things: hit a price point, hit a feature set, and hit a fashion point. Which brings us to the 2020 Hyundai Sonata.

“Sonata signifies our vision for future Hyundai designs, great active safety systems, and cutting-edge technology that is effortless,” O’Brien said.
Related: Beauty is beyond skin-deep in the 2020 Sonata.
Power & Performance: Two Solid Choices
Easier to codify are the technical aspects, like how the latest Sonata gets down the road. This time around, you get your choice of two engines the South Korean automaker dubs as “Smartstream gasoline powertrains.” One engine is a 2.5-liter GDI (gasoline direct injection) and the other, a 1.6-liter turbo (designated as “T-GDI”). Either mill is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The “big” block Smartstream 2.5 engine cranks out 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft. of torque, returning a combined EPA-estimated fuel economy of 33 mpg. The other engine, the 1.6 turbo, puts out nearly the same power and fuel economy: 180 horsepower, 195 lb-ft. of torque, and 31 combined.
Hyundai never really explains why you should go with one choice over the other, so neither will I. But really, who cares about the motive power? Hyundai buyers seem focused on other things than just going fast. What is important is comfort, safety, and infotainment as you get from point A to B.
“Beautifully Smart”
The cabin of the 2020 Hyundai Sonata seeks to be defined by a “Beautifully Smart” theme, whatever that means. There’s a big, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster front and center. It’s customizable to suit different driving modes and your preferences. In the very center of the dashboard is another large, 10.25-inch HD screen that handles all the audio-video and navigation functions. This is known as AVN and get used to hearing that phrase. It will become as standard in the automotive lexicon as ABS.
Anyway, the Sonata’s AVN screen can be split so stuff like audio and navigation displays simultaneously.
Speaking of audio, the latest Sonata has a Bose Premium sound system with 12 speakers. Hyundai says audio and EQ adjustments are made automatically, depending on the vehicle’s speed, but I’m not really going to care. Cars are not concert halls, despite the best intentions of people like Bose and Hyundai.
Related: Virtual Showdown: Tesla Model 3 vs. Hyundai Kona Electric.
Dual Bluetooth & Digital Keys
All of this stuff is wrapped up in what Hyundai calls “convenience technology,” which pretty much hits the nail right on the head. The 2020 Hyundai Sonata features a bunch of comfort and convenience features you normally find luxury cars. The Sonata comes with a sunroof; heated and ventilated front seats, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Qi wireless charging pad includes a cooling fan and there’s Text-to-Speech via Bluetooth.
RELATED
2020 Cadillac CT4: Sportiest Cadillac Ever? Maybe So.
Dual Bluetooth support means two devices can be paired at the same time. Why? One for phone calls and one for streaming audio, duh.
Hyundai Digital Key utilizes Near Field Communication (NFC) so data communication takes place only when the device and the reader are close to each other. So the 2020 Sonata can tell when you’re near, and can lock and unlock the vehicle, activate the panic alert, and start the engine. Oddly, Hyundai Digital Key is compatible only with Android phones, so you’re kind of screwed if you’ve got an iPhone. Yes, Sonatas still come with traditional keys too.
Safety & Security
Of course there’s tons of driver assistance and safety tech. For a start, the new Sonata has three radar sensors, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and five cameras. These support such safety gizmos as Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Lane Keeping Assist, Advanced Smart Cruise Control with Stop and Go, and Highway Driving Assist. There are even more digital assistants: Lane Following Assist, Safe Exit Assist; Blind-Spot View Monitor and Blind-Spot Collision Warning, along with Reverse Parking Collision-Avoidance Assist, among others.
Shoot, even the door handles have a trick system called “Touch Sensor Outside Door Handles.” To lock the car, just touch the sensor on the outside of the door handle. If you pull the handle, you activate a larger sensor on the inside of the handle to open the door.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata starts at $23,400 for the SE trim, and goes as high as $33,300 in Limited form. Add on another $930 for destination and freight charges. A complete look at the pricing and trim levels for the 2020 Sonata can be found here. Production is underway at Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama.

2019/05/11,McLaren 600LT Spider Arrives In The USA: Sign Us Up!,"600LT Spider is the convertible version of the already impressive 600LT Coupé.
A new double-wishbone suspension system features re-calibrated dampers. 
The 600LT Spider hits 60 in 2.8 seconds and has a top speed over 200 mph. 
You know when a company’s press release starts with an apology, it’s bad news. To wit: “While all examples of the limited volume McLaren 600LT Coupé have been allocated . . . ” And as your anguished cries join mine, we can all take solace in the fact we couldn’t have afforded it anyway. Probably. But wait, McLaren gives us a shot at redemption! “Customers wanting the opportunity to own one of the brand’s signature LT models still have the opportunity to place an order for the 600LT Spider.”
Verbatim from McLaren. Well sign me up!
Blowing Your Hat Off
The 600LT Spider is the drop-top version of the very impressive 600LT Coupé (the British insist you pronounce it kooPAY but I still say coop). Essentially, the Spider adds the “exhilaration of open-air driving” when compared to the Coupé (or kooPAY). That’s a reserved and nice way of saying this thing can blow your hat off to the tune of 200 mph. Obviously, when you’re a car company known more for building race cars than street cars, it’s no surprise when a publication like Nobleman Magazine names you an Automobile All-Star and Best Track Car.
Works for me.
Related: One impressive hair dryer: Meet the McLaren 600LT Spider.
Track Mentality
The 600LT Spider exudes the Longtail’s (that’s what the LT stands for) philosophy of increasing power, reducing weight, optimizing aerodynamics, and keeping the availability limited. All of that rolls up into one very sleek and very desirable car. The 600LT Spider rides on the same carbon fiber Monocell II chassis as the Coupé. The bodywork consists of carbon fiber to further enhance performance and cut weight. The fixed rear wing highlights the Longtail’s silhouette and yes, it looks nice. However, that rear wing is for more than just show (of course), producing 220.5 lbs. of downforce at 155 mph.
So it’s like having a fat guy sitting on your rear decklid, only without the (obvious) aero penalty.
And that chassis is so well-designed and stiff that it requires no additional bracing or strengthening when McLaren took the top off. The roof is a three-piece, retractable deal that raises or lowers at speeds up to 25 mph. Bonus style points for that feature.
Sharp & Crisp
The 600LT Spider is powered by the same engine found in the Coupé, a 3.8-liter V8 plant that cranks out 592 horsepower and 457 lb-ft. of torque. That’s where the “600” terminology comes from, in case you were wondering. The 600LT Spider’s zero to 60 time is a sneering 2.8 seconds, and she’ll top out a little over 200 mph. Like I shouldn’t have to say, that’s fast!

2020 Honda CR-V: What's New & What's Changed
The corners are controlled by a forged aluminum, double-wishbone suspension system with re-calibrated dampers all around. McLaren says, for good measure, drivers can expect quicker steering and sharper responses from the throttle and brakes. Speaking of cornering and coming to a stop, the 600LT Spider features bespoke Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo R tires; real gumballs that probably have a lifespan on par with a fruit fly.
Pricing & Availability
McLaren is currently taking orders for the 600LT Spider, which again, has limited availability (they keep reminding us!). The brand’s newest convertible has a starting price of $256,500. Okay, maybe don’t sign me up. I ain’t got that much. But still. It’s hard to deny the 600LT Spider. Like every McLaren before it, the 600LT Spider will be hand-assembled at the McLaren Production Centre (MPC) in Woking, Surrey, England.

If you want to add any of the optional Heritage Design Package stuff, that’ll set you back about the cost of Honda Civic: $24,510. So like I said, step aside you plebes!
All Business & Motorsport-Inspired
You do, however, get some bang for your buck. Most notably, way back there in the engine bay you’ll find a 4.0-liter flat-six cranking out 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft. of torque. That is, to use the engineering term, a lot of power. More than enough to jet you from zero to 60 in 3.8 seconds and top out at 192 mph. Oh, and said plant revs to a 9,000 rpm redline. Spaß!
Of course this is going to be a fun car, because unlike a lot of other special models, the 2019 Speedster was not developed by the marketing department, oh no. It was the brainstorm of the Porsche Motorsport department in Weissach. The windshield and side windows are cut down for that traditional speedster style and the top is a manually-operated lightweight fabric deal. There are even two carbon fiber “streamliners” (headrest fairings) on the rear decklid for an added bit of functional panache.
The inside of the 911 Speedster is all business with a focus on driving fundamentals. The door panels are lightweight with storage nets and door pulls for weight reduction. The door sill guards get the “Speedster” script and are made of carbon fiber. The seats come in basic black leather, but if you want to get all flashy, you can get red stitching for the dashboard, and red “Speedster” stitching on the headrests. You can even get a GT Sport steering wheel with a red 12 o’clock center marker.

Slim Fast Diet
There’s enough weight loss found throughout the Speedster to make Colin Chapman proud (if not outright envious). The front lid, front fenders, and rear decklid are made from carbon fiber; and that rear decklid tips the scales at only 22 lbs. The front and rear fascia are constructed out of lightweight polyurethane. Further savings is found in the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, dropping about 50 percent in weight versus cast iron rotors. The fabric top is all manual and has no motors or gears or other stuff that adds weight for the sake of your lazy convenience.
Air conditioning? Gone! Unless you really want it, then you can add it as a no-cost option if you so desire.
The six-speed manual transmission saves around nine lbs. over the seven-speed manual in the 911 Carrera, and nearly 40 lbs. compared to the PDK dual clutch unit. Oh, did I mention the 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster comes with a manual box? Well it does! So all you neo-luddites should be happy now.
Add all this up, and the 2019 911 Speedster weighs 3,230 lbs. No, not as light as a Lotus, but hey, for a Porsche (which have been getting rather porky as of late) that’s not bad. So, like they say: to go fast, add lightness and stand on that 500 horsepower mill hanging way out back!!!
Related: Spending a day with the Porsche 911 GT3 RS.
And The Engine Too!
That engine is based on the 911 GT3 and GT3 RS, having been enhanced with individual throttle bodies for sharper response. The new, high-pressure fuel injection and exhaust systems shave a further 22 lbs. (roughly) of weight. Also, the chassis comes from the 911 GT3 and features rear axle steering and dynamic engine mounts for more precision and stability. Finally, the 20-inch, Satin Black center lock wheels with high-performance tires look super cool.
Limited Run
But like I said, step aside you plebes! Porsche is now taking $274,500 plus for the new Speedster. Porsche is only making 1,948 examples of this special 911 Speedster. Why such an odd number? Because 1948 was when Porsche got their start. To celebrate that anniversary, Zuffenhausen is making this Speedster on a limited run.

2019/05/07,2020 Toyota Highlander: The Truck-Like Station Wagon,"The Toyota Highlander SUV receives an extensive overhaul for 2020.
A gasoline V6 is available as well as a hybrid option with all-wheel drive.
Interior features include wireless charging and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. 
For those that look at the new Subaru Outback and say, “I need a little more truck than that,” might I direct your attention to the 2020 Toyota Highlander. If the Outback is a station wagon with off-road capabilities, consider the Highlander to be a truck with station wagon capabilities. It’s big enough, good enough and, most of all, it’s a Toyota; so it’s going to run (almost) forever.
Down To The Basics
The basics here are this: the 2020 Toyota Highlander is a big, two-box SUV that comes in L, LE, XLE, Limited, and Platinum grades. There’s a hybrid version with optional all-wheel drive. There are three colors carried over from 2019: Blizzard Pearl, Celestial Silver Metallic, and Midnight Black Metallic. Toyota added five new colors for 2020, however: Magnetic Gray Metallic, Moon Dust (which is actually a shade of blue), Ruby Flare Pearl (red obviously), Blueprint, and Opulent Amber.
Opulent Amber is a “deep, luxurious brown” but that’s a lie. It’s brown, and brown is a terrible color for a car. Don’t buy a brown car.
Meat & Potatoes: Traditional Vs. Hybrid
Non-hybrid Highlanders feature a 3.5-liter V6 with Toyota’s Dual Variable Valve Timing and D-4S Injection system; meaning direct fuel injection with port fuel injectors. The systems combine to increase performance and efficiency, according to Toyota. Mated to a Direct Shift eight-speed automatic, the engine puts out 295 horsepower and 263 lb-ft. of torque. All-wheel drive is optional and can send up to 50 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels.
There’s a standard stop/start feature to reduce fuel consumption too. Estimates from Toyota come in at 22 mpg combined for the gasoline V6.
The hybrids have a 2.5-liter DOHC four-cylinder, mated to two electric motors in a more compact and efficient manner than before says Toyota. The ICE engine employs a mouthful called “Variable Valve Timing-intelligent system by Electric motor” or VVT-iE on the intake camshaft; whereas the exhaust camshaft uses just the Variable Valve Timing-intelligent system (or VVT-i). The all-wheel drive Highlander Hybrid uses a separate, rear-mounted electric motor to power the rear wheels only when needed. To further improve efficiency, the hybrid uses a variable cooling system (electric water pump and electric thermostat) and a fully-variable oil pump.
Toyota says all that adds up to 240 total horsepower and 34 combined mpg (based on their estimates). Not bad, eh?

Related: On the road with the 2019 Toyota Highlander.
Extra Performance & Space (And Guidance)
In case you’re interested, the battery pack is installed under the rear seats, so cargo or passenger space is unaffected. The new Highlander offers 16.1 cubic feet of carrying space behind the third row; folding that third row flat nets you 40.6 cubic feet. Drop down the second row and you have 73.3 cubic feet for hauling just about anything you can think of.
Speaking of hauling, V6 Highlanders have a 5,000 lbs. towing capacity, thanks to a heavy-duty radiator with an engine oil cooler and improved fan performance. Trailer Sway Control is also part of the package and uses the Vehicle Stability Control system to help counter unwanted trailer movement.
The Highlander Hybrid will coach you on ways to drive as economically as possible. For example, an “accelerator guide function” suggests an acceleration level according to the driving conditions. The Highlander Hybrid’s Predictive Efficient Drive (PED) analyzes your daily driving habits, along with the upcoming road and traffic conditions. That data is then used to more efficiently charge and discharge the battery.
Interior Treatments: The TV Control Room
Comfort and convenience features abound in the new Highlander. “The 2020 Highlander offers its plushest accommodations ever,” says Toyota. And with softer padded surfaces and more tailored stitching on the door trim and instrument panel, who are we to argue? The center console offers Qi wireless charging and plenty of storage spaces, with USB charging ports and ambient LED lighting to set a relaxing mood. Interior colors run the gamut from Graphite or Black cloth, to Softex artificial leather in Harvest Beige, Graphite or Black.
Higher grades get those same color choices in real leather, and the top-of-line Platinum features embossed, perforated leather trim in those three colors, plus Glazed Caramel.
The 2020 Toyota Highlander has enough multimedia stuff to make you feel like you’re driving a television control room. All grades come standard with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Alexa In-Car compatibility, Waze (handy!), SiriusXM, and Wi-Fi connectivity through AT&T and Toyota Safety Connect. Service and Remote Connectivity is available as is navigation via a 12.3-inch screen. JBL Premium Audio is standard for Limited and Platinum, and comes with 1,200 watts of power and 11 speakers in nine locations.
Safety & Security
And of course, there are tons of safety systems, from blind spot monitors to rear cross-traffic alerts. Toyota’s Safety Sense 2.0 comes standard on all Highlanders and includes: Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection; Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control; Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, and Automatic High Beams. New for 2020 is Lane Tracing Assist and Road Sign Assist. There’s also a Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, offering automatic braking should you be an inattentive moron.

Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Toyota Highlander V6 will arrive in December with the Hybrid coming in February 2020. No word yet on pricing, but since this a Toyota we’re talking about, it’ll probably cost less than you’d expect. So, if you have a bunch of people and stuff to haul around, whether it’s to the ski slopes or to school and then to soccer practice, it’s real hard to ignore the latest Toyota Highlander.

2019/05/06,2020 Acura RDX Hits Dealerships: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2020 Acura RDX is now on the showfloor for a starting MSRP under $40,000. Designed and built under Acura’s Precision Crafted Performance mantra, this current generation RDX is the product of an extensive overhaul. The 2020 RDX features a VTEC turbo engine, 10-speed transmission, and an available torque vectoring all-wheel drive system.
The A-Spec variant is there for those who want a bit more flash and flare.
The 2020 Acura RDX arrives with some clout as well, recently named as the “Best Compact Luxury SUV for Families” by U.S. News and World Report and “Best New Car for 2019” by Autotrader. The available Acura ELS Studio 3D premium audio system was even named “Car Audio System of the Year” by Business Insider. During this brief walk around, we will provide you with a top to bottom look at the 2020 Acura RDX.
Design & Technology
The 2020 RDX is the first to fully encompass Acura’s new exterior and interior design language. Diehard fans may remember the Acura Precision Concept and Acura Precision Cockpit; this is, in essence, a combining of those two elements. Acura opted for a more athletic stance, achieved by the longer wheelbase, shorter front overhang, and overall wider track. New for 2020 is a sleek Platinum White exterior color.
Inside, brushed aluminum, stainless steel, and Olive Ash wood accents compliment the sport seats and panoramic moonroof. Acura’s True Touchpad Interface combines conventional touchscreen and remote-based approaches from its perch atop the center console.
Related: On the road with the Acura RDX A-Spec.
Additional Packages & A-Spec Treatments
The 2020 RDX can be upgraded with the Technology Package and range-topping Advance Package. Available new features, depending on trim, include 16-way power adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, a 10.5-inch full-color Heads-Up Display, and the aforementioned Acura ELS Studio premium stereo. Convenience and safety features include a surround-view camera, cross-traffic monitor, and blind spot information system.
Furthermore, on-board 4GLTE Wi-Fi enables services like emergency roadside assistance, remote locking/unlocking, stolen vehicle tracking, and geofencing.
The A-Spec appearance package includes 20-inch wheels and low-profile 245/45R20 tires, gloss black exterior accents, and larger exhaust finishers. An available red or black leather interior with black Ultrasuede inserts are among the treatments inside for the 2020 RDX A-Spec.
Power & Performance
Every cake has icing and the 2020 Acura RDX is no exception. The icing here is a turbo engine with direct injection under the hood. The 2.0-liter, 16-valve powerplant with its evergreen DOHC VTEC technology creates 272 horsepower and 280 lb-ft. of torque. With its 10-speed automatic, Acura says it delivers 40 percent more low-end torque than the V6 once found within the RDX’s engine bay. With front-wheel drive, the 2020 Acura RDX delivers an EPA estimated 22/28 city/highway and 24 combined.

Where the RDX cake really gets sweet is with Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, an available torque vectoring system often written as “SH-AWD.” The system increases rear-wheel torque capacity 40 percent versus the prior generation. Up to 70 percent of the available torque can be distributed to the rear wheels; and up to 100 percent of that torque can be distributed to either the right-rear or left-rear wheel. This will provide drivers better stability and control, especially during rough weather. EPA ratings fall sightly to 21/27 city/highway and 23 combined with the SH-AWD system.
Available drive modes include Snow, Comfort, Sport, and Sport+, each one changing up the overall dynamics of the vehicle to suit differing road conditions. The drive modes utilize the Drive-by-Wire throttle, transmission, electric power steering, traction and sound control, and if equipped, the SH-AWD system accordingly.
Pricing & Manufacturing
In general, pricing for the 2020 Acura RDX (including destination) ranges from about $39,000 to $49,000, depending on how its equipped. For example, the entry-level RDX with front-wheel drive starts at 38,595. At the top end, the 2020 RDX with the Advance Package and SH-AWD starts at $48,695. An A-Spec package with front-wheel drive starts at $44,795 or 46,795 with SH-AWD.
The 2020 Acura RDX is manufactured in East Liberty, Ohio.

2019/05/01,2020 Subaru Outback: A Brand New Beast (With A Few Old Tricks),"The Subaru Outback receives updates across the board for the 2020 model year. 
For the first time in the model’s history, the Outback has a turbo engine option. 
Safety features are numerous as are the connectivity and infotainment features. 
The 2020 Subaru Outback is here, and when I say new, I mean all new. New body, new interior, new safety features; lots and lots of new stuff. The only thing that isn’t entirely new is Subaru’s fantastic boxer engine and the use of all-wheel drive. But why would you even mess with something as good and as proven as that?
Really, when you get down to it, Subaru will always have two aces up its sleeve. The first is that all-wheel drive system. If you live anywhere north of a line stretching from Mendocino to Atlanta, you already know why having all four wheels putting out power is a good thing.
The other is that flat-four-banger engine. It’s good but not outstanding in a lot of engineering terms. But what it does bring to the table is a laughable low center of gravity. You put that engine together with that all-wheel drive system and you get capital “G” grip for days. To top it all off, you get Subaru’s Active Torque Vectoring along with a number of the automaker’s vehicle control systems.
But what else is Subie bringing to the party for 2020?
Power & Performance
A first for 2020 is the availability of a turbocharger, previously unseen in the Outback lineup. This 2.4-liter turbo plant kicks out 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft. of torque, more than enough to get me into trouble. If you opt for the standard naturally-aspirated engine, a 2.5-liter flat-four, you get 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft. of torque. Subaru says almost 90 percent of the 2.5-liter’s parts are new. The transmission is a Lineartronic CVT with an eight-speed manual mode accessed via steering wheel paddle shifters, which is fun.
You can get up to 3,500-lb. towing capacity, the most of any Outback in history, from the turbo 2.4. Perfect if you need to tow things like a trailer with a bunch of kayaks for a weekend camping trip. Even the mileage figures are pretty good now, with the 2.5-liter getting you 26/33 city/highway and the turbo returning 23/30 city/highway. Note these are Subaru’s estimates and not the official EPA ratings.

Suspension Setup
The suspension is entirely new, lighter, and more responsive. There are MacPherson struts up front with a new internal rebound spring, aluminum lower L-arms, and a 23mm hollow stabilizer bar. It’s hard to miss the weight savings in all of those components. The rear end has a double-wishbone with a subframe, coil springs, and a 19mm hollow stabilizer bar. There’s 8.7 inches of ground clearance on all Outbacks, so that’ll come in handy if you’re one of those camping/skiing/hiking types.

Safety & Security
As you would expect, there’s lots of safety features in the 2020 Subaru Outback. The vehicle structure itself is 70 percent stiffer in both torsional and front-suspension rigidity, and 100 percent stiffer in both front lateral flexural and rear subframe rigidity, compared to the previous Outback. That is impressive in and of itself because it improves crash protection. If that isn’t enough, the Outback comes with eight standard airbags. Ultimately, Subaru expects the Outback to achieve top safety scores during testing later this year, including a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
Speaking of safety stuff, Subaru’s EyeSight Driver Assist Technology is standard and includes Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control with Lane Centering; a DriverFocus Distraction Mitigation System and LED Steering Responsive Headlamps; Reverse Automatic Braking, Blind Spot Detection, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Lane Change Assist; and finally, the EyeSight Assist Monitor with a heads-up display.
New for 2020 is a Front View Monitor that captures images within the driver’s blind spots in front of the vehicle. It then displays them on a 180-degree view inside. In other words, if you run over anything in the 2020 Subaru Outback, you must be a complete idiot and should take cabs from now on.
Related: An in-depth look at the 2020 Subaru Legacy.
Connectivity & Technology
In addition to all the safety tech, the 2020 Subaru Outback has enough connected vehicle and entertainment technology to make you feel like you’re driving a block of downtown Tokyo. Subaru’s STARLINK system allows you to control entertainment and vehicle settings via the touchscreen display, although now it has new on-screen controls. It also has smartphone and app integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth capability, and audio streaming connectivity. That tablet-style touchscreen is an 11.6-inch, full HD setup with voice-activated navigation powered by TomTom.
SiriusXM radio and SiriusXM Travel Link come with complementary subscriptions. Tunes are provided by a 12- speaker Harman Kardon audio system, with Clari-FiTM compressed audio restoration technology and a GreenEdge amplifier and speakers.
The 2020 Subaru Outback offers the new Chimani app that provides a guide to more than 400 national parks in the U.S., including park history and highlights written by local experts. You can’t say Subie doesn’t know their buyers backwards and forwards.
Interior Treatments
On top of all this technological goodness is a great deal of creature comforts. Limited and Touring models feature 10-way power front seats with lumbar support and adjustable cushion length. Both the front and rear seats are heated with more coverage – up to your shoulders – for 2020. Ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel are also available, as are four USB ports and two 12-volt DC power sockets.

There’s lots of cargo space, with up to 75.7 cubic feet of space on tap and a cargo floor length of 78 inches. More than enough for half a Marshall stack and a couple of guitars in hard cases!
There’s even a new feature that opens the rear hatch by simply waving in front of the Subaru emblem. For those on an outdoor adventure, the Outback offers roof rails with retractable cross bars and tie-downs. In other words, if you can’t fit it in the 2020 Outback, you should be able to fit it on the 2020 Outback.
Pricing & Availability
Pricing for the 2020 Outback will be announced closer to this fall’s on-sale date. The 2019 Subaru Outback starts at $26,345, so expect the 2020 version to be at least that much. The Onyx Edition XT will also be available in the Outback lineup. It features black exterior elements, 18-inch alloy wheels, and a gray two-tone interior.

2019/04/29,2020 Cadillac CT5: Reviving the American Sport-Luxury Sedan,"Inspired by the Escala concept, the 2020 Cadillac CT5 is the replacement for the CTS.
Cadillac’s Super Cruise system for the CT5 utilizes LiDAR map data and high-precision GPS.
Two engines and three different trim levels will be offered when the CT5 becomes available. 
The 2020 Cadillac CT5 needs to fulfill a demanding role. It strives to resuscitate the dying sports sedan segment while giving buyers a worthy alternative to the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4, and BMW 3-Series. Unfortunately, it is also battling with the wonderful Genesis G70, Audi A5 Sportback, and the beauteous Alfa Romeo Giulia, which are not exactly pushovers to begin with.
The 2020 Cadillac CT5 is the venerable replacement for the aging CTS. Despite having smaller dimensions, the CT5 wants to address the shortcomings of the existing CTS by having more room, sportier handling, and the latest tech gadgets to match.
The 2020 Cadillac CT5: Designed To Impress
First and foremost, a sports sedan should look the part. How else would it attract potential buyers who are otherwise looking to purchase a crossover or SUV? Thankfully, the new Cadillac CT5 has all the bases covered with its sporty and luxurious vibe in terms of styling. The model range at launch includes the Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Sport trims. Each is graphically different, but each retain the aggressive and sporty styling of the Escala concept car. For example, the luxury versions of the CT5 receive brighter exterior accents and unique grille inlays. On the other hand, the Sport model has darker accents, performance-inspired detailing, 19-inch wheels, and a rear spoiler.
“From every angle, the CT5 exudes athleticism, sophistication, and confidence,” said Andrew Smith, Executive Director of global Cadillac design. “Cadillac’s signature hard-edge cues have evolved to a more sculptural and fluid expression of the brand’s design language.”
The sportier profile of the Cadillac CT5 is due in large part to the longer, 116-inch wheelbase and the sweeping fastback profile, which is remarkably similar to the silhouette of the Kia Stinger. The new CT5 sits on top of GM’s Alpha platform. The result is a sedan with lower proportions, taut character lines, and shorter overhangs in the front and rear.
“The first-ever Cadillac CT5 showcases Cadillac’s unique expertise in crafting American luxury sedans,” said Steve Carlisle, Cadillac President. “Its details elevate every drive and reward the senses.”
Turbocharged Power
Based on looks alone, the Cadillac CT5 is a welcome relief from the angular styling cues of the CTS. When viewed entirely from the front, the new CT5 has subtle hints of the Mazda 6 and Chevrolet Camaro. Meanwhile, the controversial rear pillar design is lifted directly from the aforementioned Cadillac Escala concept car.

But all this beauty is for naught without a powerhouse motor. The 2020 Cadillac CT5 is available with two engine options. The Luxury trim receives a 2.0-liter four-banger with twin twin-scroll turbocharging to produce 237 horsepower. This engine benefits from a three-step sliding camshaft for greater torque delivery across the power band.
Higher trim models get a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 with 335 horsepower and 400 lb-ft. of torque. Both engines are connected to a 10-speed automatic with standard rear-wheel drive and an optional all-wheel drive system. Cadillac went further by equipping both engines with direct injection, cylinder deactivation, camshaft phasing, and an automatic stop/start system.
Related: Cadillac enters the “Goldilocks zone” with the new XT6.
Enhanced Driving Dynamics
Performance, comfort, and refinement: these are the qualities that define the new CT5, according to Cadillac. In order to achieve all this, the CT5 makes good use of the double-pivot MacPherson front and five-link independent rear suspension. It also comes with ZF MVS passive dampers and a Bosch rack-mounted electric power steering system to further enhance handling, ride comfort, and steering feel.
The car even gets selectable drive modes to make it run with the rest of the German and Japanese pack. Drivers can select Tour, Sport, Snow/Ice, and My Mode to calibrate the transmission shift points, steering firmness, braking feel, and the torque split in the front and rear wheels (for AWD models). Toggling between each mode will also alter the audible character of the CT5.
Plush Interior
Cadillac wasn’t looking to reinvent the wheel in designing the interior of the CT5. The primary focus is on material quality, attention to detail, and overall craftsmanship. You’ll find carbon fiber, open-pore wood trim, and soft leather inside the CT5. The Platinum Package adds heated and ventilated front seats, upgraded leather trim in the armrest and center console, magnesium paddle shifters, and alloy pedals. Perhaps the most prominent part of the instrument panel is the standard 10-inch touchscreen.
The new Cadillac CT5 will also come with AppleCarPlay and Android Auto, wireless charging, and a premium Bose audio system.
Super Cruise Hands-Free Driving
If Tesla has Autopilot, Cadillac has Super Cruise. I don’t know about you, but Super Cruise sounds better and is less geeky. Whatever the case, Super Cruise allows CT5 drivers to enjoy the benefits of a self-driving car. First seen in the CT6 sedan, the 2020 CT5 is the first Cadillac to have Super Cruise since then.
Cadillac is planning to make Super Cruise available on all models beginning next year, with other GM brands to follow after that time. Super Cruise can automatically steer, brake, and keep the vehicle positioned on the highway in certain, optimal conditions. This driver assistance feature utilizes LiDAR map data, high-precision GPS, and an innovative driver attention system, along with radar sensors and data from a network of cameras. The technology gives you the freedom to drive the Cadillac CT5 hands-free on more than 130,000-miles of limited-access freeways in the United States and Canada.

If this means cruising on the highway while eating a cheesesteak sandwich, I’m all in.
The 2020 Cadillac CT5 also features adaptive remote start technology and a hands-free, foot-activated automatic trunk. The former allows you to remotely activate the ventilated seats, climate control system, and heated steering wheel so the CT5 is all cozy when you enter the car.
2020 Cadillac CT5 Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Cadillac CT5 is built at GM’s Lansing Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan. It will be available for ordering this fall. No word yet on pricing, but we’re guessing the CT5 will start between $47,000 and $50,000.

2019/04/26,2020 Lincoln Corsair: The Skull & Bones Clubhouse On Wheels,"The 2020 Lincoln Corsair looks quite promising, with strong levels of performance and luxury.
As the market shifts away from sedans, Lincoln is looking to capitalize on new consumer tastes.
“Lincoln now has a full family of SUVs to exceed the needs of our clients,” says the brand’s president.
Lincoln rolled out a new SUV, the Corsair, at the 2019 New International York Auto Show. And this just might be the one that saves Lincoln. Lord knows it won’t be another cool sedan, which is all Lincoln used to make. And the sad fact of the matter is that no one is buying sedans today, even if they’re as cool as can be. In fact, Ford remains confident their decision to shift away from sedans in their product line was the right move. Hence, we will see more SUVs from Dearborn, the latest being the 2020 Lincoln Corsair.
“P” Is For Presence
Look, I’m a sports car guy. I make no bones about that and I make no apologies for it. But there is something to be said for big, imposing sedans. Something with capital “P” Presence to burn. Something like a 1962 Lincoln Continental, for instance. You pull up to the curb in one of those, and buddy, you know you’ve arrived. But, like I said, people aren’t into sedans any more. People are into SUVs. I get that. Practicality, blah-blah-blah. Usability yadda-yadda-yadda. Whatever. It’s your dollars making the payments and it’s your butt in the seat, so it’s your choice.
However, Lincoln found themselves in a bit of a conundrum. If all they had to do was make sedans with more than enough power and comfort (and capital “P” Presence), easy-peasy, job done. But, try as they might, they couldn’t make that work. And so Lincoln teeters on the brink of doom (for decades now) trying to convince people to buy sedans. Well, they finally cottoned to what was what, and voila, we now have the 2020 Lincoln Corsair to consider.
And it is very worth considering.

Defender of the Skies
For starters: Great name. Corsair. It’s either taken from sort-of-bad-guy pirates or (my belief) one of the nastiest fighter planes of the Second World War. Next, it’s got capital “P” Presence. It doesn’t have the hulking mass of its bigger brother, the Navigator, but it’s hard to miss and ignore. Also, that roll out color? Perfect! A darkened blue that looks like an used gun barrel. That’ll make ’em pay attention!

“Entering the fastest-growing luxury segment, the all-new Corsair is artistically crafted, expertly designed and infused with our unwavering attention and commitment to detail; it’s unapologetically Lincoln,” said Joy Falotico, Lincoln Motor Company President.
Lincoln calls the Corsair a luxury SUV, which is exactly what it is. You will never, ever see a Corsair at the end of 12 miles of bad road picking up a bunch of muddy, greasy lumberjacks done with another long day of work. The Corsair is an SUV, but it’s not that kind of SUV. There’s a bit in the Lincoln press materials about the Corsair titled “sanctuary for the senses” and that pretty much defines what it’s like on the inside. Imagine if the Skull & Bones clubhouse was on wheels, and you pretty much got it.
The seats are 24-way adjustable, have massage capability, and additional lumbar support for drivers and front passengers. The second-row passengers get tons of legroom, thanks to the sliding seats that offer up to six inches of travel; and a 60/40 fold-flat or split-bench option. Lincoln says the Corsair offers more legroom in the second row than larger SUVs like the Mercedes-Benz GLS and Tesla Model X.
Pin Drop
“Quietness is paramount for Corsair,” Lincoln says. And they get there by the most elaborate means imaginable. The dashboard is a dual-wall design, isolating you from the engine compartment and its troublesome noise. That’s not enough though. Rather than normal buzzers, there are six unique symphonic chimes that inform you of everything from an open fuel door to an unbuckled seat belt. The chimes were recorded by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. No. Really. The Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
The stereo is a specially-tuned Revel system specific to each individual Corsair. In other words, the placement, tuning, calibration, and number of speakers is unique to each vehicle. Wireless charging for your mobile devices? Of course! (no unsightly wires). There are multiple power outlets throughout and Wi-Fi comes standard. Integrated SYNC 3 technology of course (this is a Ford product, after all) with AppLink. Drivers can access their apps from an available eight-inch touchscreen. Nice!
Keys? Not with the Corsair. Now your smartphone is your key. You can remotely start and unlock your Corsair; open the rear liftgate, and trigger a personal profile that automatically adjusts up to 80 features to your preferences.

Safety & Security
Standard driver-assist features include Pre-Collision Assist with automatic emergency braking and Pedestrian Detection; Blind Spot Information System, Lane-Keeping System, rear backup camera, and and auto high-beams. If you’d like, there’s also adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist. Evasive steer assist offers assistance to the driver to help avoid a collision with a slower or stopped vehicle. Reverse brake assist can help you stop if the rear sensors detect an obstacle behind you. Active Park Assist Plus even parks the beast for you.

Power & Performance
Power, oh, it’ll have enough of that. The 2020 Lincoln Corsair comes with your choice of two turbo four-cylinder engines. The standard 2.0-liter plant puts out 250 horsepower and 275 lb-ft. of torque, while the 2.3-liter mill packs 280 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. of torque. Both are hooked up to a new eight-speed automatic transmission. The all-wheel drive system switches between front- and all-wheel drive, depending on road and weather conditions.
Powertrain performance can be further customized by using one of five drive modes: Normal, Excite, Slippery, Deep Conditions, and Conserve.
Serious Contender
But the real bottom line here is how the new Corsair is a serious choice for people with serious money to spend. And that means Lincoln just might make it back from that brink. Which is fine with me. Expect the 2020 Lincoln Corsair in dealerships this fall.

2019/04/24,2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS: Inside The S-Class of SUVs,"The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS is the brand’s most luxurious SUV.
It’s bigger inside for 2020 to give passengers more comfort and space.
An available powertrain combination produces over 500 lb-ft. of torque. 
SUVs are, or at least started out, as barely civilized work trucks designed to haul people and their stuff from point A to B no matter the road conditions. Over time, people wanted a less truck-like demeanor and more car-like comfort. Which leads us directly to this, the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS.
The title just about says it all, doesn’t it? The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS is big, safe, and loaded with everything a driver or passenger could want. Sounds like an S-Class, no? It’s like an S-Class, only shaped like a big friggin’ box with all the subtly and styling of a half-track.
For me, that’s a good thing. I like my SUVs devoid of pretense.
Space & Comfort
Mercedes-Benz goes in a different direction with the GLS, stating right up front how it’s the “largest and most luxurious SUV” in their lineup. Further, the Germans say the new GLS is about offering more: more space, more comfort, and more luxury. For 2020, the GLS is 2.4-inches (60 mm) longer, wheelbase-wise, so the interior is more spacious, especially for second-row passengers. For example, legroom here is increased by 3.4 inches when the seats are in their rearmost position, which also makes it easier to jump in.
There are three, fully-electric and adjustable seat rows so all passengers get a generous amount of space and comfort. The third-row seats can lower into the floor to increase the trunk space, while the second-row seats fold flat. In other words, you’ve got tons of space for stuff if you need it, and when you don’t need it, you’ve got lots of space for people.
Speaking of space for people, there is a six-seater variant of the GLS that has two luxurious captain’s chairs for the second row, a first for 2020.
Executive Treatments
There’s an Executive Rear Seat Package with a separate seven-inch Android tablet for controlling the comfort and entertainment functions from the rear. It is even possible to order a lumbar massage function for the rear seats. HVAC? Shut up and get out! Five-zone automatic climate control for the rear seats, each set by the tablet. Also standard is the Easy-Entry function for getting into and out of the third-row seats (meaning all of the rear seats simply move forward and/or fold down via a button).

Acura MDX PMC Edition Arrives: Here's How It's Different.
The center console also offers a wireless charging compartment for smartphones and additional USB ports.
But that’s just the start of everything the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS packs.
Between Gas & Hybrid
Also hitting the road for the first time in 2020 is the GLS 580 4MATIC. This big-block V8 variant has Mercedes’ EQ Boost system, a 48-volt on-board electrical setup with an integrated starter generator. Running the higher 48-volt setup allows for, in this instance, what would be a normal starter as a generator; and as a continually-available power source. This EQ Boost system sort of halves the way between hybrids and gas engines. It’s pretty clever.
By comparison, the GLS 450 4MATIC comes with a turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, also with EQ Boost. But c’mon, you’re going to go for the 580!
The V8 gasoline engine with the 48-volt, on-board electrical system and starter generator creates 483 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. of torque; with a further 184 lb-ft. of torque and 21 horsepower available via the EQ Boost over short periods. By comparison, the six-cylinder with the same 48-volt technology produces 362 horsepower and and 369 lb-ft. of torque; with a further 184 lb-ft. of torque and an extra 21 horsepower available via the EQ Boost over short periods.
All variants of the new GLS feature a nine-speed automatic. The electronically-controlled, multi-plate clutch transfer case allows for a “variable transfer of drive torque” from zero to 100 percent (torque on demand) between the axles.
Handling & Aerodynamics
The new GLS also features Mercedes’ sophisticated E-Active Body Control, an active suspension system paired with the aforementioned 48-volt technology. The result is a more comfortable ride and agile handling, and a higher degree of off-road capability. For example, the off-road functions on the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS include a “rocking mode.” Say your new GLS has become bogged down in the sand because you were out catching the waves. Well, the suspension level will automatically raise and lower several times, changing the ground pressure of the tires to improve traction. This, according to Mercedes-Benz, helps the GLS “rock itself free.”
Furthermore, Mercedes says the GLS has impressive aerodynamics with a Cd of 0.32. They’re right, that is impressive, for something that’s shaped like the crate it’s shipped in. With regard to aerodynamics, special attention was paid to the underbody and the air flowing through the engine compartment because of the vehicle’s shape. With the GLS, engineers had to address the more upright front end and higher ground clearance when it came to air flow. Ultimately, the new GLS was subjected numerous computation loops, CAE simulations, and wind tunnel measurements in Sindelfingen, Germany.

Oh, and get this: there’s a new Carwash function. Push a button and “woosh,” the mirrors retract, the side windows and sunroof close; the climate control goes to air-recirculation mode, and the 360 camera shows what’s directly ahead so you have an easier time getting into the wash. All that stuff you would normally do with several steps is now done with a single button. Ain’t life grand?
Manufacturing & Availability
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS will go on sale in the U.S. by the end of the year, with production taking place in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Look, I’m not usually one to advocate for this sort of thing but if (and this is a big if); you’re rich and have a large family, it sure sounds like the new GLS is the ride for you.

2019/04/23,2020 Nissan GT-R 50th Anniversary & GT-R NISMO: Godzilla Gets Bigger Teeth & New Clothes,"New for 2020 are the Nissan GT-R 50th Anniversary Edition and GT-R NISMO.
The GT-R 50th Anniversary Edition harks back to the Nissan GT-R Skyline R34.
The 2020 Nissan GT-R NISMO receives carbon fiber body panels to save weight.
Nissan fans rejoice! The Japanese car maker has something good in store for the 2020 Nissan GT-R supercar. Making its debut at the New York International Auto Show is the Nissan GT-R 50th Anniversary Edition, and alongside it, the new GT-R NISMO. But for the new variants, Nissan didn’t want to tamper with the GT-R’s proven racing formula.
“The GT-R is about total balance management,” said Hiroshi Tamura, Chief Product Specialist for the GT-R. “It is not about chasing power figures, but creating a new GT-R where no aspect has been overlooked.”
The Nissan GT-R has always been the quintessential Japanese supercar. It gave the Audi R8 and Porsche 911 quite a scare when it graced the market in 2008. And even though the 2020 model is still part of the first-generation, Nissan saw it fit to equip Godzilla with bigger teeth and new clothes.
Nissan GT-R 50th Anniversary Edition
Commemorating 50 glorious years of racing heritage is the 2020 Nissan GT-R 50th Anniversary Edition. This is purely an appearance package that pays homage to the dominance of the original R34 Skyline GT-R. The car receives a new Bayside Wangan Blue paint job with white racing stripes. If this color looks familiar, you’re right. It’s the same color of Paul Walker’s original right-hand drive R34 Skyline in the 2 Fast 2 Furious movie.
“The Nissan GT-R has been the icon of our company’s driving performance for the past half century,” explained Shinichiro Irie, GT-R Program Design Director. “While the exterior and interior changes may seem subtle at first glance, they’re still impactful, especially with the new paint schemes, keeping the car’s lines and overall presence modern and edgy.”
The paint job consists of a four-coat, double-heat treatment process to achieve a genuine old-school feel. The wheels also get blue accents on the spokes to complete the new look. But if you don’t like this color, don’t fret. The 50th Anniversary Edition GT-R is also available in pearl white with red stripes, and silver with white stripes.
In the meantime, the interior also receives numerous updates including a special gray color scheme along with exclusive trim for the steering wheel and shift knob. The dashboard and the seats are covered in hand-selected Nappa leather to exude a premium vibe. The center console houses an eight-inch touchscreen monitor with NissanConnect, an integrated navigation and communications system. This feature allows potential owners to lock and unlock the doors remotely or summon emergency services using an app. The car also gets special embossed seats, and an Alcantara-covered headliner and sun visors.

Refined Performance (With A Little Growl)
Who could forget the mighty RB26DETT straight-six motor in the original R34 Skyline GT-R? Nissan outdid themselves with the VR38DETT V6 motor in the current-generation GT-R. But for 2020, Nissan’s engineers went for subtle upgrades to further improve the performance and efficiency of the raucous V6 motor.
The 2020 Nissan GT-R receives new turbochargers to improve the low rpm response of the V6 motor. New exhaust manifolds and optimized turbo flange attachment points are in the mix. The result is the same 565 horsepower and 467 lb-ft. of torque, but the 3.8-liter V6 is now more responsive and engaging. The six-speed dual-clutch automatic features a new adaptive shift control algorithm too. This means more aggressive downshifts with better gear selections on both the street and racetrack.
Rounding up the performance-enhancing mods is a retuned, electronically-controlled suspension to provide the right balance between handling prowess and ride comfort; along with new steering calibrations and a new brake booster. Also new is a titanium muffler with burnished blue titanium tips to produce the signature GT-R exhaust growl.
2020 Nissan GT-R NISMO
The 2020 Nissan GT-R NISMO remains an absolute beauty among high-performance street and track machines. This hardcore version of the GT-R is nearly 44 lbs. lighter, courtesy of carbon fiber components like the hood, roof, trunk, front and rear bumpers, and the rear spoiler.
The front fenders now come with scalloped vents directly from the GT3 GT-R race car. More than just an aesthetic piece, these vents serve multiple purposes. Besides channeling hot air away from the engine bay, they also provide more downforce over the front tires for better handling and agility.
“The 2020 GT-R NISMO has evolved into a balanced, yet extreme, performance car,” Tamura said. “Pursuing driving pleasure is the most important concept behind GT-R.”
Lacing Up The New Shoes
The 2020 Nissan GT-R NISMO comes with lightweight 20-inch RAYS forged aluminum wheels with a nine-spoke design. The car also receives newly-designed Dunlop tires with wider tread and fewer grooves to increase the contact patch by 11 percent. The semi-slick tires enable the GT-R NISMO to achieve higher cornering forces with better steering response.
Of course, what good is going fast if you can’t stop on a dime? Thankfully the GT-R NISMO comes with larger Brembo calipers and carbon ceramic brake rotors (16.1 inches front, 15.3 inches rear). The rotors, in particular, were crafted using a carbon and silica carbide structure. When paired with the new racing-derived brake pads, the brakes generate more friction, but also greater resistance to high temperatures; temperatures of more than 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit!
“Brembo and Nissan have a rich performance history,” said Dan Sandberg, Brembo North America President and CEO. “Our engineers worked in concert with the Nissan team to take data from the track, and combined that with lessons learned on the previous generation GT-R, to design the next evolution stopping package for this road-going supercar.”
Blistering Performance
The 2020 GT-R NISMO receives a 600 horsepower version of the 3.8-liter V6. The hike in power is courtesy of a turbocharger inspired by no less than the GT3 race car. The turbo comes with fewer blades and a modified turbine shape to optimize the flow rate. With 481 lb-ft. of torque available from 3,600 to 5,600 rpm, the new turbocharger improves acceleration response by 20 percent without compromising horsepower.

2019/04/23,2020 Mustang 2.3L Performance Package: From Engine Swap To Reality,"This special 2020 Mustang began as a one-off passion project with a Focus RS engine swap.
The Mustang team went to Spain to convince management there to help them with the engine.
The 2.3L High Performance Package provides the 2020 Mustang with a more responsive power band. 
A five-person skunkworks project in the Ford Performance garage, an engine swap, and a trip to Spain. Each played an important part in Ford’s new 2.3L High Performance Package for the entry-level Mustang EcoBoost. With the package, Ford says the 2020 Mustang Ecoboost becomes the most powerful four-cylinder sports car from any American automaker.
And just in time for the pony car’s 55th anniversary.
The Engine Swap
Reminiscent of the original Mustang in 1964, this Ecoboost variant started as a five-person, one-off project in the Ford Performance garage. The team wanted something that could handle everything from coastal mountain roads to autocross courses; braking and aerodynamics were considered at length, but where to find an engine?
“The Ford Performance Focus RS 2.3-liter engine is a high-revving marvel, and anyone who’s driven this EcoBoost engine instantly loves how quickly it responds and delivers power,” said Carl Widmann, Mustang Chief Engineer. “When our team got the chance to try this specially-built engine in a Mustang, we immediately agreed, ‘we have to do this.’”
After doing the Focus RS engine swap, the Mustang team realized they had something special. By taking advantage of Ford’s new product development times, they were able to complete the design-to-approval process for the 2.3L High Performance Package in under 10 months.

Across The Ocean
The swap was one thing, but getting the actual engine was another. So the Mustang team caught a flight to Valencia, Spain, traveling to Ford’s Valencia Engine Plant, home of the 2.3-liter. The goal? Convince plant management to build a new variant of the turbo four-cylinder specifically for the Mustang. Spoiler alert. They said yes.
From there, it was about honing in on the already strong attributes of the Ford Performance engine. After meeting with plant management in Spain, the Mustang team had the essentials; the die-cast alloy block and higher-performance cylinder heads, for example. However, the team specified a five percent larger (63 millimeters total) twin-scroll turbo compressor and a larger radiator. After calibrating it to run both Ford’s 10-speed SelectShift automatic and six-speed Getrag manual, things were really shaping up.
“It’s not just the horsepower gains over the standard 2.3-liter EcoBoost, it’s the broader torque curve that delivers 90 percent of peak torque between 2,500 and 5,300 rpm, which is 40 percent wider than the base EcoBoost engine,” Widmann said.

Estimates come in at 330 horsepower and 350 lb-ft. of torque (premium fuel) for the 2.3L High Performance Package. Zero to 60 happens in the mid-four-second range, with top a speed of 155 mph. This represents a 10 mph gain over the 2019 EcoBoost Performance Package.
“Plus, horsepower holds stronger up to the 6,500-rpm redline – enabling more usable power and torque for enthusiasts and weekend autocrossers to enjoy,” Widmann added.
Related: On the road with the Ford Mustang GT.
Balance & Control
A fully-independent suspension, a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear axle, and a near-balanced 53/47 weight distribution keep the Mustang and its 2.3L High Performance Package planted on the road. Up front, the new Mustang features a 32-millimeter sway bar and a 21.7-millimeter tubular bar at the rear. For greater steering precision, the team added an alloy strut tower brace to stiffen the chassis at the front. To improve stopping power and fade resistance, the 2.3L High Performance Package adds larger four-piston fixed calipers and 13.9-inch front rotors (from the Mustang GT).
To increase overall performance, drivers can opt for the EcoBoost Handling Package. It includes semi-metallic brakes, MagneRide dampers, and 19×9.5-inch aluminum wheels with 265/40R Pirelli P Zero Corsa4 summer tires.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Ford Mustang with the 2.3L High Performance Package arrives at dealerships this fall. New colors for 2020 include Grabber Lime, Iconic Silver, Red Hot Metallic Tinted Clearcoat, and Twister Orange. As of this writing, Ford has not disclosed the starting MSRP for the 2020 Mustang.

2019/04/22,Acura TLX PMC Edition: A Brief Walk Around,"The Acura TLX PMC Edition is hand-built at the company’s Performance Manufacturing Center.
Special exterior color using nano pigment technology was developed for the limited edition TLX.
The TLX is the first Acura model to receive “PMC Edition” treatments with the MDX to follow. 
Another surprise for this year’s New York International Auto Show was Acura’s roll out of the 2020 TLX PMC Edition. The PMC, which stands for Performance Manufacturing Center, is sort of like Acura’s version of BMW’s M division or Mercedes-AMG, only if it actually went faster. The 2020 Acura TLX PMC Edition gets some nice finishing touches here and there, and is assembled with greater care, but that’s about it.
Wishing For Slightly More
The TLX PMC Edition is a limited edition car, although Acura does not say what the actual production numbers will be. At this point, my guess it will be a special edition until they run out of the little glue-on serial plaques that say “Special Edition.”
Sad, really, given what Honda is capable of in the performance arena, but they have always been a conservative car company. Their vaunted NSX came out powered by a V6 when everyone else was going for much higher cylinder counts. Branding something as “PMC” and building it alongside the NSX at the actual Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio; but not giving us a hot-rod version seems like kind of a waste.
Power & Performance
The 2020 Acura TLX PMC Edition sits atop the TLX lineup, powered by an i-VTEC V6 engine with direct-injection. The 3.5-liter V6 makes 290 horsepower and is paired to a nine-speed automatic. Acura’s torque-vectoring system, Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive, is on-board and a godsend in slippery conditions. When the hand-assembly process is complete, each TLX PMC Edition will undergo the same quality controls as the NSX; including dyno checks, final paint inspection, rough-road simulation, and water leak tests.
It is not, however, a factory stripper; it is still loaded with the full-zoot of premium features from the TLX Advance Package. The exterior is anything but run-of-the-mill, featuring PMC Edition exterior treatments and interior design elements from Acura’s A-Spec line.
Shiny & New
The easiest way to spot the 2020 TLX PMC Edition is by the Valencia Red Pearl pain, which Acura says is “deeply lustrous and grade-exclusive.” It’s made using something called nano-pigment technology that can only be applied in the bespoke factory’s advanced paint facility. (It was previously reserved for the NSX only). Acura goes into excruciating detail about the hows and whys of their ever-so-cool paint, but it’s basically candy apple red and seems, to my eyes, not all that dissimilar to what hot-rodders and low riders have been doing since 1959.
RELATED
2020 North American International Auto Show Canceled Amid Coronavirus Outbreak
Only Acura takes five days to paint this TLX. I guess it’s worth it.
Other goodies include lots of gloss black stuff. There’s gloss black 19-inch, split-five-spoke wheels with black lug nuts; a gloss black roof panel, door handles, and grille with body-colored surround. There are shiny bits too, like the dual four-inch black chrome exhaust tips. The heated seats feature black Milano leather with Alcantara inserts, black piping and red stitching; those look quite nice. There’s a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel with red stitching and paddle shifters, and there’s red stitching on the door panels, center console, and armrest as well.
A-Spec Treatments
Even the floor mats are special, with metal A-Spec badging. Speaking of A-Spec, the PMC gets a trainload of that stuff too: A-Spec exterior and interior appearance packages, along with jewel-eye LED headlights, LED foglights, and GPS-linked navigation with Apple Carplay and Android Auto. The stereo is this great big whompin’ thing, an Acura ELS Studio premium audio system with 10 speakers and enough power to make you go deaf.
Tech & Safety
Wireless charging for phones? Check. Surround view camera system? Check. Power-folding door mirrors with auto-dimming? Of course! Front and rear parking sensors, blind spot information system, rear cross traffic monitor? Duh! And of course, there’s the full suite of AcuraWatch safety technologies to keep you from doing anything egregiously stupid.
Pricing & Availability
Like I said, this is a limited-run TLX, but final numbers are so far absent. Deliveries of the 2020 Acura TLX PMC Edition will begin this summer with pricing around $50,000.

2019/04/18,2019 Audi TT RS: This Little Guy (Really) Packs A Punch!,"The 2019 Audi TT RS features a powerful 2.5-liter TFSI engine.
Styling treatments include 20-inch wheels and red brake calipers.
The new TT RS joins the Audi Sport model line and is available now. 
Audi is showing off the latest hot rod version of the TT sport coupe, the TT RS. The RS goes a long way to dispel any notions of the TT being all show and no go thanks to a *check notes* – holy smokes! How much power does this little guy have?! Jumpin’ August Horch on a pogo stick, are you kidding? The 2019 Audi TT RS really packs a punch!
The answer to that question is “no I am not kidding” (and certainly neither is Audi). More to the point: 394 horsepower and 354 lb-ft. of torque thanks to a reworked 2.5-liter TFSI engine. That is, to use the technical term, a lot of power. Especially for a car this small.
Action & Traction
Yes, the TT, like all Audis, are heavier than you’d expect. They’re chunky guys loaded with lots of machinery, this one weighing in at 3,300 lbs. Still, nearly 400 ponies is worth respecting. This 2.5-liter TFSI plant is that good, old school five-banger derived from the Ur-Quattro, cracking away in the “so ugly it sounds beautiful” 1-2-4-5-3 ignition sequence. Add this all up and the latest, hottest TT can jet to 60 mph in a very respectable 3.6 seconds.
The five-cylinder mill is hooked up to a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Audi says the launch control program allows a “heightened level of acceleration,” which just cracks me up. Heightened? Yeah, like Genghis Khan had a “heightened” appetite for land acquisition. Speaking of land acquisition, thanks to the standard quattro permanent all-wheel drive setup; and the ability to send nearly 100 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels; and a traction control system, this thing can grab the tarmac with all four paws and just m-o-v-e.
Rain? So what. Snow? Who cares. Mud and gravel? Not my problem. The 2019 Audi TT RS is all about optimal acceleration with minimal slip.
Styling & Design
The exterior of the new TT RS got a slight going over with a matte black Singleframe grille and the signature quattro script in matte titanium. Audi says there are additional radiators (plural!) behind the honeycomb grille for improved cooling. Lateral air inlets now extend to the front wheel wells and a continuous front spoiler gives the car a lower, Motorsport-inspired look. Full LED headlights with LED daytime running lights are on the front end with LED taillights hanging out back. Also out back is a fixed rear wing and large oval tailpipes, adding to the TT’s overall aggressive appearance.

2019/04/17,2019 Porsche 911 Speedster: Consult Your Doctor Before Driving!,"Gorgeous and rare, the 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster makes its debut in New York. 
The flat-six engine revs to an impressive 9,000 rpm as it cranks out 500 horsepower. 
Expect it at U.S. dealers near the end of the year but the ordering windows open soon.
Who says nothing interesting ever comes out of the New York International Auto Show? Porsche just dropped a new 911 Speedster powered by the engine found in the GT3 and GT3 RS. And great googly-moogly can this thing rip. They’ll sell it to anyone with a check that won’t bounce, but you better get in line now for your 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster.
That’s sort of the bad news or, more accurately, half of the bad news.
Big Checks & Limited Runs
Porsche is only making 1,948 of the 2019 911 Speedster. Why such an odd number? Because 1948 was when Porsche got their start, and to celebrate that anniversary, Zuffenhausen is making the Speedster on a limited run. The other half of the bad news is this: $275,750. That’s how big that check must be before you can drive it. Sure, sure, that’s a lot less than, oh, a Ferrari Pista Aperta, but Porsches have always been the value-conscious choice. Still, that’s nearly 300-thousand dollars, or about the equivalent of three-bedroom home in suburban Indianapolis.
Then again, a three-bedroom home in suburban Indianapolis won’t blow your hair back like the 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster.
And the Speedster can do this thanks in large part to the naturally-aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine, sourced from the current 911 GT3 and GT3 RS. Spinning up to 9,000 rpm, it’s good for 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft. of torque which (checks slide rule, punches some numbers into calculator, consults astrolabe) is a fricken ton. Given this thing tips the scales at only 3,230 lbs., the Speedster should simply fly down to the next corner. Which it does. With ease. Zero to 60 mph ensues in just 3.8 seconds. Top speed is 192 mph.
If erection lasts for more than four hours, consult your doctor.

The Essentials: Nothing More, Nothing Less
The Speedster is more than just an engine (I’m surprised I’m saying that like its a bad thing). Porsche cut down the windshield and side windows and dropped the height of the manually-operated, lightweight fabric top. This is always a cool choice, both for chop-top hot-rodders like myself and for harkening back to the original Speedster and its cut-down greenhouse look. Carrying on with that semi-retro look are the two headrest fairings – Porsche calls them streamliners for some reason – on the rear decklid. These are carbon fiber for a bunch of obvious reasons.

Speaking of weight savings, the interior of the 911 Speedster is nicely paired back to the more-or-less essentials. The door panels are lightweight and have storage nets and fabric loop pulls for weight reduction. More weight savings measures are found in the front luggage compartment lid, front fenders, and rear the decklid. Each are carbon fiber, while the front and rear fascias are lightweight polyurethane.
The Spartan Approach
That fabric top? No power up/down for you, my friend. Manual operation only. Air conditioning? Gone. (But it can be added at no cost if you so desire.) And the final weight-saving cherry on top: the six-speed manual transmission. This saves nine lbs. compared to the seven-speed manual transmission in other 911s, and almost 40 lbs. compared to the PDK dual clutch tranny. Yes, the PDK is a better way to shift gears. Yes, you’re a neo-Luddite if you think old-school manuals are the way to go.
But you can keep all that to yourself when it comes to the 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster.
Related: An in-depth look at the Porsche 911 GT3 RS.
Chassis & Braking
The chassis is a derivative of the 911 GT3, with a re-calibrated rear axle steering system and dynamic engine mounts for a supreme amount of precision and stability. The wheels are even kinda attractive: 20-inch center lock, satin black jobs wrapped with high-performance tires. Porsche doesn’t say but they’ll probably end up being Michelins or Contis for seriously high levels of grip.
Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes are standard and save about 50 percent in overall weight from the cast iron setup. According to the company, it delivers “very powerful and consistent braking performance.” Which is a nicely understated way of saying it’ll nearly pop your eyeballs out if you mash on the binders.
It has always been this way: Porsche makes great brakes!
And A Few Extras
Oh, and for those of you swayed by tchotchkes, buyers of the 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster will get a Porsche Design 911 Speedster Chronograph timepiece (i.e. watch). It comes with tons of gee-gaws and stems and calibrations and ways to calculate the rotational mass of the cup holder if you were driving on Venus and stuff like that.
If you’d like, you can get red stitching for the dashboard and a “Speedster” script on the headrests of the black leather seats. The door pulls are also red and so is the 12 o’clock center marker on the GT Sport steering wheel.

2019/04/16,Mercedes-AMG A 35 Sedan: The Nemesis For Audi & BMW Hot Shoes,"The Mercedes-AMG A 35 Sedan shows how big things can come in small packages. 
Under the hood, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo engine provides over 300 horsepower. 
The individual AMG-tuned drive modes are complimented by a special “RACE-START” feature. 
Mercedes-Benz recently dropped one of their typically huge press releases on their (relatively) small A 35 performance sedan. And small though it may be, it is still very much a Mercedes. Given the performance, it’s still very much an AMG. It’s the three-pointed star version of an Audi S4 or BMW M3. And in a lot of ways, the latest Mercedes-AMG A 35 Sedan is the opposite of what you think of a Mercedes as being.
It’s small and powered by an even smaller engine, for starters.
Smiles & Burning Rubber
Usually, Mercs are these big Bahn cruisers powered by engines derived from tanks. The A 35, on the other hand, doesn’t take up that much space with its little 2.0-liter four cylinder power plant. Then you thumb though the performance stats and find out the little four-banger puts out 302 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. torque. Mercedes has squeezed the livin’ daylights out of this little guy with some good old German engineering.
For example, the engine’s crankcase is lightweight die-cast aluminum to reduce weight; and the housing of the twin-scroll turbocharger divides into two parallel ducts. This makes it possible to channel the exhaust gases separately on the turbine wheel in the interest of efficiency, so says Mercedes-Benz.
But the end result? Smiles and burning rubber!
Power & Performance Tech
Throttle response is said to be fantastic, since the twin-scroll turbocharger is optimized to reduce back pressure and improve efficiency. On top of that, the engine features CAMTRONIC (German VTEC), high-precision piezo injectors, multi-spark ignition, and intelligent thermal management. The engine is mated to an AMG-spec seven-speed with a standard RACE-START function. This allows maximum acceleration from a stand-still, which sounds like a lot of fun!
Downstream from there, you’ll find the AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive system that, given the short wheelbase and abundance of power, must come as a Godsend. It can vary the power distribution from front-wheel drive only, to a 50:50 split front to rear. Interestingly, a multi-disc clutch pack is integrated in the rear axle, being electro-mechanically controlled for sharper driving dynamics and significantly faster response.
Of course, all this happens by more than just your right foot. There are five AMG Dynamic Select drive programs on tap: Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport + and Individual. They pretty much do what the name says, with the differences between Sport and Sport+ being how Sport+ gives you louder exhaust notes and deactivates the start/stop system. Sport+ also double-declutches during downshifts and uses partial cylinder cut-offs at full load.

Handling & Braking
Mercedes says “special axle geometry” provides more agile handling while aluminum components reduce unsprung mass. Working with the suspension is the AMG Dynamics system, which integrates the car’s handling control system with the ESP stability control. This applies a little bit of differential rear braking to enhance cornering and comes in two basic flavors: Basic and Advanced. AMG Ride Control takes care of the suspension itself with adaptive, adjustable damping and three different configurations, from comfort-focused to sporty. The fully-automatic system adapts the damping for each wheel according to the driving situation and road conditions within milliseconds.
The steering is a speed-sensitive, electro-mechanical setup with variable ratios. There are two “characteristic curves,” depending on which drive program is running.
Even though this is a little guy, it has brakes that could stop a freight truck. Up front you’ve got four-piston monoblock calipers and 350-millimeter brake discs; the rear has single piston sliding calipers and 330-millimeter brake discs. The discs are internally-ventilated, natch, and perforated, also natch, to dissipate heat and prevent fading. The silver-painted calipers even have black AMG lettering for a little bit of flash.
Interior Treatments
The interior of the Mercedes-AMG A 35 Sedan is awash in Star Trek levels of technology. Humorously, Mercedes calls its multimedia control system MBUX, and we will not let them live it down. Mitigating that name is the fact it works astonishingly well. MBUX shows you “emotionally appealing presentations” with maximum-resolution 3D graphics. The “Widescreen Cockpit” has two displays but under one shared glass.
The Alexa-like voice control system is brought to life by saying “Hey Mercedes.”
Essentially MBUX turns all the usual dials and gauges and such into one, integrated, tablet-like display system. You can reconfigure and setup the MBUX system for any given driver. So dad’s version of the dash can have the Supersport mode with its central, round tachometer, for example.
Pricing & Availability
All this adds up to a zero to 60 time of less than five seconds (4.7 to be precise), and a top speed Mercedes prefers not to tell us at the moment. Same goes for exactly when this little guy will be in stores and how much it will cost. By all accounts, expect it in dealerships later this year as a 2020 model. Now, it’s not the big open highway cruiser you might choose; but for more urban environments, the new Mercedes-AMG A 35 Sedan will probably be a nemesis for all you Audi and BMW hot shoes out there.

2019/04/15,VW Tarok Concept Has Potential But Will We Actually See It?,"The VW Tarok concept is about balance more so than brute force.
VW says they don’t have plans to bring it to the U.S. market.
However, it will be on display during the NY Auto Show. 
Could the traditional players in the U.S. truck market soon see a new participant in the game? Well, no says Volkswagen but reading between the lines, it does seem like a strong possibility. Meet the VW Tarok concept, a lean, mean hauling machine, set to enter production in South America in the near future. VW will show the concept at the upcoming New York International Auto Show, saying they will use the occasion to gauge market reaction.
VW Tarok Concept: By The Numbers
At 193.5 inches long, the Tarok concept is one of the largest on VW’s evergreen MQB platform. Overall, it’s 72 inches wide (without wing mirrors) and 66 inches high (without roof rails). The wheelbase is a comparatively long 117.7 inches, with shorter overhangs in both the front and rear (36 and 39.8 inches respectively). And within these dimensions VW is rather creative in terms of cargo and payload.
For example, the bed actually extends into the cab to accommodate larger items. The available space increases via a mechanism for folding down the bottom of the passenger cabin’s rear panel. The width of the load area between the wheel arches is 42.9 inches, with a bed length of 47.5 inches. Drop the tailgate and the load area is extended by 27.4 inches. Opening or folding the door to the cabin, and folding the rear seats, extends the load area by another 25.8 inches.
Total payload is a healthy 2,271 lbs.
Finding Balance
Power and performance. These two words carry a lot of weight (both literally and figuratively) in the truck market, although they are not the only metrics on which to measure success. For example, the current Honda Ridgeline is nicely-balanced between performance and efficiency, placing its eggs in several different baskets. Versus its body-on-frame counterparts, the uni-body Ridgeline tows less; but it still tows a reasonable amount (max 5,000 lbs.), and an amount more realistic to everyday use cases.
Yet what it lacks in towing capacity, it makes up for in fuel economy. It also handles much better than a rear-wheel drive truck with its on-board i-VTM4 torque vectoring system. Going through the Ridgeline, spec-by-spec, it becomes apparent balancing each one of the truck’s features was the end goal. Although we don’t have that level of detail yet on the Tarok concept, it looks like a similar approach.

  Drive Modes & Custom Settings
The Tarok concept employs VW’s 4Motion Active Control, an all-wheel drive system with selectable driving modes. In the mix are Comfort, Normal, Sport, Eco, and Individual with four other “higher-level modes.” If drivers move the switch to the left, they find the “Onroad” and “Snow” profiles. Turning the switch to the right yields both “Offroad” and “Custom Offroad” settings. In general, the profiles alter the throttle response, transmission, steering, and climate control accordingly.
Under the hood is a 147-horsepower, 1.4-liter turbo four cylinder with direct injection. The engine is paired to a six-speed automatic. While this is fine in concept-form, VW would almost certainly increase the horsepower before breaking into the American market. Doing so in concert with the 4Motion AWD system would make the Tarok a nicely-balanced truck for everyday use. With a turbo engine, there are benefits concerning both power and economy for the Tarok. Tack on the all-wheel drive system, and handling becomes more stable off-road, and during nasty weather.
Brute strength is one thing; balanced and refined performance is another. Taking a guess here, but it seems VW is after the latter with the Tarok concept.
Styling & Design
The Tarok concept’s horizontal bars in the grille transition into the LED headlights and daytime running lights. The aluminum frame extends from one side to the other, covering the Tarok concept’s rear panel. VW’s infamous “tornado lines” return, this time as a “sharp undercut” above the door handles, complimented by the “powerful shoulder section.” The A-pillars come finished in gloss black while a continuous LED strip adorns the rear.
A glass-covered 9.2-inch infotainment screen and the configurable Volkswagen Digital Cockpit system underscore the interior. The Tarok concept lacks very little in the connectivity department, with a range of online services and apps, and Bluetooth capability.
In Person
The VW Tarok concept will appear at the New York International Auto Show, beginning on April 19th. Expect the Tarok in Brazil first but if things go well in the Big Apple, VW may consider bringing it to North America. While that remains to be seen, it’s hard to deny – at least from the initial specs – the Tarok’s great potential. It looks fun and functional, and would likely be an excellent daily driver for John Q. Public.
We will have to start sending a bunch of letters to VW headquarters, asking them nicely to consider our request.

2019/04/12,2020 Audi R8: The German Supercar In Italian Clothing,"The 2020 Audi R8 receives updated styling and new Decennium limited-edition trim.
The R8 V10 also gets 30 more horsepower when compared to the the previous model.
Audi is still offering the R8 V10 Performance version with a whopping 602 horsepower.
Audi fans, mark your calendars. The 2020 Audi R8 will make its first appearance at the upcoming New York International Auto Show. What better way to introduce the next-generation of Tony Stark’s favorite supercar than in the glitz and glamour of the Big Apple!
But to make the event more special, Audi will also feature the limited-edition R8 V10 Decennium. This model commemorates ten years of V10-powered goodness in the R8 supercar, with only 50 units allocated for North American buyers.
2020 Audi R8: The German Supercar In Italian Clothing
First, allow me to express my thoughts. The original Type 42 first-gen R8 with the venerable 4.2-liter V8 motor is still the best R8 in my book. It also happens to be the best-looking R8 too. Shame on Audi for killing the V8 FSI motor!
There, I said it. Now I can breathe and we can move on.
On a different note, the 2020 Audi R8 is morphing into a dapper German car in Italian clothing. It receives an updated front bumper with a new honeycomb grille and an R8 badge. The front also comes with lateral air intakes and new front spoiler lip. Audi also threw in darkened headlights to complete the new aggressive face.
I don’t know about you, but the new Audi Singleframe grille is a bit too extreme for my liking. However, the looks are entirely subjective at this point. And to be quite honest, I don’t want my R8 looking like a Lamborghini from afar with all those sharp creases, but that’s just me.
Thankfully, things look better in the back. The new Audi R8 gets an updated rear bumper with honeycomb air outlets, a new rear diffuser, and oval exhaust pipes. It also gets 19-inch, double-five-spoke wheels in a bi-color finish. If you think 19-inch wheels are so last year, Audi is offering 20-inch rollers with a 10-spoke Y-design in a high-gloss anthracite finish. The V10 Performance model gets unique 20-inch wheels and forged rims in a titanium finish.
More Powerful V10 Motor
No mid-cycle refresh is complete without adding heaps of power, most especially in a supercar. The new Audi R8 V10 Coupe and Spyder receive a 562-horsepower version of the oversized mill, which is 30 horsepower more than the previous model. With 406 lb-ft. of torque, the car launches from zero to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds (3.5 seconds for the convertible). Top speed is 201 mph (200 mph in the Spyder).

The R8 V10 Performance in both the Coupe and Spyder receive a 602-horsepower version of the 5.2-liter V10 engine. And while this is the same output as the previous R8 V10 Plus, it’s still good for a zero to 60 mph time of 3.2 seconds, and a top speed of 205 mph. Whichever you choose, you get Quattro all-wheel drive and a seven-speed S-Tronic automatic, so the new R8 is still outrageously nippy if you know what I mean.
Notice the new top speed? The good news is all R8 models have a top speed of at least 200 mph. Now, this type of velocity is useless in the real world, but it matters in the face of stiff competition from the McLaren 570GT, Acura NSX, and Lamborghini Huracan.
Related: A spec by spec comparison of the Audi e-tron GT and the Tesla Model S.
Racing-Inspired Interior
The 2020 Audi R8 receives the Audi virtual cockpit with a fully-digital gauge cluster. It also gets MMI navigation as standard, along with LED interior lighting and a Bang & Olufsen audio system with 13 speakers. You also get the Audi phone box with a signal booster and wireless charger. This feature is included in all models of the new Audi R8.
Again, this may sound like I’m nitpicking, but the conventional shift handle looks out of place inside the new R8. If the Lamborghini Huracan gets buttons for the shifter, why can’t the R8 have those too?
Audi R8 V10 Decennium
Celebrating ten years of V10-powered goodness is the V10 Decennium. There are only 222 examples of the Decennium with the last 50 units (numbers 173 to 222) reserved for U.S. buyers. If you think the unique name gets you a more forceful version of the V10 engine, I’m sorry to burst your bubble. And if you want your limited-edition Audi R8 in pearl white, sunburst orange, or blue crystal, you’re out of luck.
All 50 examples of the Audi R8 V10 Decennium receive a Mythos black metallic paint job. It also gets the same 602 horsepower engine as the R8 Performance. Want a Spyder version? Umm no. It’s only available in Coupe form.
The biggest changes are mostly cosmetic with a plethora of Decennium logos on the inside and outside, and milled 20-inch wheels in a matte bronze finish. The side sills, rear diffuser, and front spoiler have a gloss black finish. The Audi rings and badges are also blacked-out while the side blades, rear wings, and mirror housings have a glossy carbon fiber finish.

You also get new door lights that project the “Decennium” logo, and the limited-edition build number on the ground; which is a nice way of saying you own the most special Audi R8 ever as you open the door at night.
2020 Audi R8 Pricing
At the time of this writing, the 2020 Audi R8 V10 Coupe starts at $169,900 while the Spyder will set you back $182,100. The V10 Performance version starts at $195,900 for the Coupe and $208,100 for the Spyder. The R8 V10 Decennium starts at $214,995, around $19,000 more than the V10 Performance.

2019/04/08,Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer Concept: A Glimpse of Magnificence?,"Mitsubishi says the Engelberg Tourer Concept can handle any and all weather conditions.
Total driving range of the plug-in hybrid – engine and batteries combined – is over 430 miles.
A special home charging system with solar panels accompanies the Engelberg Tourer Concept.
The Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer is more than a glimpse of magnificence from the once-mighty Japanese diamond star. It is proof that future crossover vehicles – whether plug-in hybrids or full-electric – will be far from boring. And they won’t look the same, either.
Look at this thing, for example. The Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer is hard to figure out, which is probably the reason I’m loving it already. There’s a shock and awe factor when you first catch this SUV. There’s no denying the sporty and adventurous DNA; Mitsubishi vehicles are known for their sportiness anyway.
Yet viewed from the side and rear, the Engelberg Tourer has subtle hints of rugged luxury, similar to the Range Rovers and Land Cruisers of the world. Folks, you are looking at Mitsubishi’s next-generation plug-in hybrid SUV.
Brutish & Modern Style
Sadly, the Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer is just a concept. Then again, this SUV is actually pretty close to reality, and similar to the Nissan IMQ concept CUV in some ways. Although different in size and scope, both concepts would likely find promising markets, given consumer demand for SUVs and crossovers today. But unlike the Nissan (which seems like the offspring of a Nissan supercar and Lexus crossover), the Mitsubishi Engelberg bears a striking resemblance to current Mitsubishi vehicles.
Are you familiar with either the Mitsubishi Triton/Strada/L200 pickup; Montero Sport/Pajero Sport SUV; or the Xpander MPV? The common denominator between each is the “dynamic-shield” face. But with the Engelberg Concept, the dynamic-shield design is cleaner and more defined. The design is a bit polarizing, I’ll give you that, but the brutish face grows on you like a goatee.
What’s In A Name?
But compared to existing Mitsubishi SUVs, the Engelberg Tourer is chunkier and more purposeful. There’s no doubt the Engelberg Tourer concept is a vehicle for active lifestyles. Even the “Engelberg” appellation is derived from a well-known ski resort in Switzerland. I’m sure you’ll agree, it doesn’t get sportier or more outdoorsy than being named after a Swiss alpine resort.
But if I were Mitsubishi, I’ll choose Outlander or Pajero Sport as a final name. And if I’m betting my hard-earned dollars, I have a feeling this concept will shed the odd name for something more familiar or appealing like, umm, Outlander or Pajero Sport.

Mustang Mach-E: An Inside Look At What All The Buzz Is About
Advanced Electrification
As the Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer made its entrance during the Geneva International Motor Show, most of the hype focused on the Twin-Motor 4WD plug-in hybrid system. Now that’s quite a mouthful, so allow me to break it down. Similar to other plug-in hybrids, the Engelberg Tourer comes with a 2.4-liter gasoline engine. But it also comes with a rather large battery pack and two electric motors – one for the front and one in the rear. This allows the vehicle to achieve an impressive all-electric cruising range of 43 miles or 70 kilometers.
But if you take into account a fully-charged battery pack and a tankful of delicious petrol, the Engelberg Tourer has a cruising range of 434 miles or 700 kilometers. This is because the gasoline motor is acting as an onboard generator to charge the battery pack in series-hybrid mode.
Combined with the sleek shape and active radiator shutters, the Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer is aerodynamically-enhanced to achieve every ounce of range, according to the company. And Mitsubishi was able to do all this without scrimping on cabin space. This vehicle is roomy enough to accommodate seven.
All-Wheel Control Technology
But the talk of the town is the twin-motor, full-time 4WD system. This is enough to make Mitsubishi fanboys blush with excitement. The Engelberg Tourer utilizes Active Yaw Control (AYC) and Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) in the powertrain.
Now, where did I hear that before? If you answered Lancer Evolution, you’re right on the money!
Active yaw control allows the electric motor to tailor the torque split between the front wheels. In the meantime, S-AWC alters the braking force at each wheel. It also monitors the power output in the front and rear electric motor. What does this all mean exactly? Picture the handling dynamics of a rally car combined with the ruggedness of an off-road SUV fed by electrons. If you add other abbreviations like ASC (active stability control) and ABS, the Engelberg Tourer is an SUV you can definitely throw around.
What’s next? The Dakar Rally or World Rally Championships, perhaps? Come to think of it, that’s not a far-fetched idea considering Mitsubishi’s affiliation with all things related to rallying and off-road endurance.
Green Charging Options: DENDO Drive House
It’s nice that Mitsubishi is making an initiative towards sustainable energy options. The DENDO Drive House (DDH) technology is proof of that. The goal is to package the DDH system with the Engelberg Tourer. It consists of a bi-directional charger, solar panels, and home battery.

Yes, it’s remarkably similar to Tesla’s Powerwall. The DDS system will basically absorb power from the sun and store the energy in a larger battery pack. This means you can charge your plug-in hybrid vehicle using pure solar energy. This also means you can power your home at night using the juice from the home batteries and PHEV.
The DDH system will be available at Mitsubishi dealers in select markets around the world, but the Japanese car maker will start offering the service initially in Japan and Europe later this year. The dealer will handle installation and after-maintenance.
Pricing & Availability
All of this sounds promising, but how much will it cost? Considering a pair of Tesla Powerwalls will set you back around $15,000, it will be great if Mitsubishi bundles the DDH system at a lower price. As for the Mitsubishi Engelberg Tourer, it’s just a concept for now. It’s our best guess as to when we will see it on the market, if at all.

2019/04/06,Bentley Continental GT Number 9 Edition: The ‘Blower’ Reimagined,"The Continental GT Number 9 Edition pays homage to Bentley’s racing heritage. 
Bespoke elements include a popular race car and aviation finish from the 1920s and ‘30s. 
Mulliner will handcraft only 100 of the Number 9 Edition cars, making them a rare collector’s item. 
Here’s a limited edition I can get behind: the Bentley Continental GT Number 9 Edition by Mulliner. That’s a bit long-winded, so I’ll go with the Number 9 Edition. True, it’s more of a grand tourer than an outright sports car, but it’s still plenty cool.
And plenty fast. And plenty comfortable.
Did I mention fast?
Love Potion #9
You don’t really think of Bentley as being a performance brand these days. Oh sure, they’ve got enough power to dust a bunch of cars on the road, but the public perception is one of luxury first, then performance. It was not always that way. Back in the 1920s and 30s, Bentley made serious sports cars. Sports cars you could drive to Le Mans, race, and win with. Sure, they were large and heavy and rather agricultural in their chassis design, but with a big enough engine and, more to the point, an even bigger blower bolted to that big engine, you can outrun the competition.
The Bentley Continental GT Number 9 Edition is a version of their Conti GT, which celebrates the company’s racing heritage. The big “9” on that lovely mesh grille harkens back to their victorious Le Mans racer, and is such a cool touch that it’s worth buying the car for that alone. While there is no denying the rich history, the Conti Number 9 is more than just a number spray-panted on the grille. A lot more.
Related: The quest for more power: the story of the ‘Blower’ Bentley.
Bespoke Body Work
For starters, this guy features a Mulliner body. Mulliner is one of those olde-school companies that used to build the bodies for cars back when you bought everything separate. They are very, very good at what they do and are also very, very British. For Bentley and Bentley buyers, nothing less than Mulliner would ever do my dear boy. Their roots date back to the 1500s and the creation of luxurious horse-drawn carriages. Mulliner showcased work on a Bentley chassis for the first time in 1923, exhibiting a two-seater Bentley at the Olympia Show in London, four years after Bentley Motors was founded.
Today, Bentley’s Mulliner team helps customers personalize their Bentley with bespoke themes, some of which are really elaborate.
The Number 9 Edition is also noticeable by No. 9 badge work throughout the car. The exterior colors are up to the customer: Viridian green or Beluga black. Now, the Beluga black is very nice and shows the lines ever so well, but England expects you to go with the Viridian green option. And if that’s not enough, W.O. expects it as well (and if I have to explain to you who W.O. is, then I will have to most strongly question your upbringing sir, most strongly!).

Turned Aluminum & Jaeger Clocks
On the inside you have the choice of Cumbrian Green or Beluga heritage hides, each with higher gloss levels applied to the seats, inner door panels, and other areas. There’s debossed ‘B’ logos on the headrests and door panels, just like they did on the original ‘Blower’ back in the day. The dashboard is uniquely crafted and features “Engine Spin” on the center console. Often known as “Turned Aluminium,” Engine Spin was a popular race car and aviation finish in the 1920s and ‘30s as it limited light reflection.
In yet another classy move referring back to the good old days, there’s an exclusive British Jaeger clock face in the center console. It’s inspired by the original ‘Blower’s’ dials and uses the same traditional manufacturing methods of race car dials from the vintage era.
Slivers of History
Also – and this is one of the coolest moves I’ve seen a car company pull off in a very long time – the Continental GT’s Rotating Display features a wood insert from the seat of Sir Tim Birkin’s No. 9 Le Mans race car. This backlit piece is set in resin and situated in the middle of the center dial of the rotating display, and I am floored by the gracefulness and classiness of this move. You get a car and you get a piece of racing memorabilia. Bentley is only making 100 of these bad boys, and each will feature 18K gold-plated organ stops like those found in the original.
Power & Performance
As with the other Continentals in the line, the Bentley Continental GT Number 9 Edition is lighter, faster, and even more refined. Powered by the company’s W12 TSI engine, it hits 60 mph from a standstill in 3.6 seconds, topping out at 207 mph. No, you’re not going to confuse it with a Lotus Elise, but Land o’Goshen this guy hauls the mail!
All I can say is you better buy yours in Viridian green or you will deserve the slap The Queen of England will lay on you.

2019/04/06,Aston Martin AM-RB 003 (Valhalla): One Rare Grocery Getter,"The AM-RB 003 joins the Valkyrie and Valkyrie AMR Pro as the third mid-engine Aston Martin.
A material called FlexFoil, developed by FlexSys Inc. and validated by NASA is found on the car.
Update as of June 2019: Aston Martin officially names the AM-RB 003 the Valhalla. 
It was called Project 003, now Aston Martin has made it official, saying they will produce an all new, mid-engine sports car called the AM-RB 003. The Aston Martin AM-RB 003 joins the Valkyrie and Valkyrie AMR Pro as the third mid-engine car from the brand. The RB in there stands for Red Bull (that would be the racing team, not just the drink maker) meaning there is lots of direct technology bleed-through from an F1 team into what will soon be seen on the streets.
This is, in short, a good thing.
“When Aston Martin secured the services of Red Bull Advanced Technologies to embark on the extraordinary journey that became Aston Martin Valkyrie and Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR Pro, it was always my hope that it would lead to a long-term collaboration,” said Andy Palmer, Aston Martin Lagonda President & Group CEO. “As these projects enter an incredibly exciting phase with the commissioning of the first running development prototypes, it gives me tremendous satisfaction to confirm that this exceptional partnership is continuing with the AM-RB 003.”
Taking On The World
Aston Martin has been on a bit of a tear lately, releasing a whole slew of concept cars or, actually, concept drawings. To me, this could mark a dangerous decent into Silicon Valley vaporware, but let’s leave that be for the moment. A few of these Aston drawings/show cars are actually destined for the roads, the AM-RB 003 being the latest one.
What the Aston Martin AM-RB 003 is, is a mid-engine V6 two-seater aimed squarely at the same sort of cars coming out of Maranello or Woking or Stuttgart. This is both a marketing solution and an engineering one. You can only get so far with front engine/rear-wheel drive cars (something that before now was all Aston Martin made). From a performance standpoint, and marketing-wise, if you don’t have anything to offer your potential buyers in that arena, then you are guaranteed not to have many sales.
“We were quite deliberate in AM-RB 003 to not disguise its lineage, but we were equally emphatic that it would be a distillation of Aston Martin Valkyrie and not a dilution,” explained Miles Nurnberger, Aston Martin Director of Design. “The design isn’t as extreme in some areas, but it pushes just as hard in others, and is even taking certain ideas and concepts a step further. That’s a natural function of design evolution, but also testament to just how great an influence working with Red Bull Advanced Technologies on Aston Martin Valkyrie has had on our approach to everything that’s come since.”

One Rare Grocery Getter
The AM-RB 003 follows in the wheel tracks of the upcoming Aston Martin Valkyrie hypercars. It will incorporate concepts and technologies taken directly from F1 racing and those first used on the Valkyrie. Think of it as Aston’s 488 GTB or Cayman. The 003 will not be as all-out performance-oriented as the Valkyrie, and will have greater concessions to practicality and road use. In other words, you could use it to drive to work or get groceries.
They will only produce 500 copies of the AM-RB 003, so they will be a fairly rare sight.
One of the biggest differences between the two Astons will be inside, with the 003 being more usable day-to-day and more comfortable. The doors open forward, like LMP1-style doors, taking a section of roof with them for easier ingress and egress. The center console is wider and there is luggage space on a “terrace” behind the seats. Aston says there will be storage areas for “oddments such as a wallet or mobile phone.”
Which is really stretching it, if you have to point out stuff Toyota has been doing since 1973.
There is a display screen on the steering column for the best possible view through the steering wheel. Aston Martin says the infotainment system utilizes a “bring-your-own” technology approach for maximum functionality, simplicity, and flexibility. In other words, your smartphone will run stuff inside the car. This is a good move.
Performance & Aerodynamics
At the moment, Aston is not saying much about the motive power behind the 003. Just that it will be “the first car to receive Aston Martin’s new hybrid turbo V6 engine, marking Aston Martin’s return to in-house designed engines.” So sorry, no in-depth specs on displacement, power output, hybrid power or any of that stuff. We’ll have to wait.
The aerodynamics, on the other hand, look to be very cutting edge. Although not stated outright, it’s easy to see this is all bleed-through from Adrian Newey’s involvement in the Valkyrie. The 003 will have a noticeable front keel and huge rear diffuser. The underfloor will generate the bulk of the downforce. On the top of the AM-RB 003, you will find next-generation aircraft morphing technology that creates a variable airfoil across the rear wing. Named FlexFoil, Aston Martin is the first to deploy it in the automotive industry.
Although to my eyes, it seems like a similar deal to McLaren’s bendy-foldy stuff on their upcoming Speedtail.
Aston’s version allows the downforce to be changed without changing the angle of the wing itself. So you know, it’s like a flap. Obviously, going this route allows for higher performance, improved efficiency, and reduced wind noise.

In the meantime, Aston Martin has revealed the official name of the AM-RB 003: The Valhalla.

2019/04/05,2019 Ram Heavy Duty: Drugstore Cowboys Need Not Apply,"Hey Cool! I get to write about a truck for once. Normally this is Carl Anthony’s end of things, but this time the truck news finally ended up on my desk. I like trucks. They’re no BS, no screwing around kind of deals. They’re tools that exist to get the job done, and everything else; the bells and whistles, the frills and things like that, just don’t really matter. In this case, we’re talking about the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty.
Posers Need Not Apply
Before we get into how good of a tool the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty is, we should deal with the growing trend of (shudder) trucks heading upmarket. The very top of the line trucks these days are getting as fancy as Buck Owens’ stage get up. Near as I can tell, the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty is not aimed at the drugstore cowboys of this world. No, thankfully, even with its luxurious treatments, the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty is aimed at those who need to haul stuff to and from a work site.
Powerful Tools
In that respect, the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty fits the bill. The standard 6.4-liter Hemi V8 with cylinder deactivation and variable cam timing provides 410 horsepower and 429 lb-ft. of torque. Remember, this is the base model engine. The specs just get better and better from there.
For example, the all-new 6.7-liter Cummins I-6 High Output Turbo Diesel cranks out 1,000 lb-ft. of torque at 1,800 rpm. Yes, that is a lot. But it’s also not overkill either. If you have to tow something really heavy, or have the bed weighed down with a bunch of stuff and you’re starting out on a slope . . . in the rain . . . in the mud and sand . . . you get the idea. Speaking of that stuff, the new Ram HD can tow 35,100 lbs. and carry 7,680-lb. of payload when properly equipped.
If you’re a numbers kind of guy, that’ll pretty much settle the argument for you.
Related: An in-depth look at the 2019 Ram 1500.
By The Numbers
The new 6.7-liter Cummins High Output Turbo Diesel features a compacted graphite iron block, cast-iron cylinder heads, stronger pistons with low-friction rings, and new exhaust valves, springs, and rocker arms. A new exhaust manifold serves as the mounting point for the variable-geometry turbocharger, delivering boost pressures up to 33 psi. The standard Cummins Turbo Diesel improves to 370 horsepower (2,800 rpm) and 850 lb-ft. of torque (1,700 rpm).
Attached to the High Output Cummins is an Aisin AS69RC electronically-controlled six-speed automatic. The standard Cummins runs an upgraded version of the 68RFE six-speed automatic; and the 6.4-liter Hemi receives the TorqueFlite 8HP75 eight-speed automatic with more than 40 shift maps to optimize performance and fuel economy.

These powertrains aim to make your job easier, whatever that might be.
Essential Foundations
Ram’s engineers placed an even greater emphasis on strength, reworking the frame to yield the highest levels of torsional rigidity yet. The new frame is over 98 percent high-strength steel with six separate cross-members, hydro-formed main rails, and fully boxed rear rails; all meant to increase durability and efficiency. Furthermore, new lightweight materials in the frame and powertrain, along with an aluminum hood, cut the overall weight by 143 pounds.
You’ll also notice the redesigned Ram HD is the best riding and handling truck they’ve ever made. For example, two “Active-Tuned Mass Modules” mounted on the frame rails search out unfavorable vibrations and apply countermeasures to eliminate them. Active-Level rear air suspension (meaning air bags replace coil springs) is available, and includes a new bed-lowering feature to help when hooking up trailers. Ram says the supplemental air bags help soften the feel of a heavily-loaded truck.
They also upped the ride quality with Frequency Response Damping shocks, more progressive springs, and re-engineered bushings. The braking system receives upgraded calipers and booster and master cylinders to help shorten stopping distances and improve brake-pedal feel.

Interior & Technology Treatments
But hey, this is a 2019 truck we’re talking about here, so it’s not all Spartan minimalism. That refinement is enhanced by active noise cancellation, various anti-vibration devices, and acoustic glass; each contributing to the quietest cabin yet for a Ram HD truck. The interior receives new materials, colors, and textures, including hand-wrapped leather instrument panels. The Uconnect 4C NAV, with its 12-inch configurable screen, is complimented by SiriusXM and a 750-watt, 17-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. In the center console, there are 12 different storage configurations with dedicated and assignable switches, a wireless charging dock, and five USB ports.
Finally, the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty has more than 100 safety and security features, including adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning.
Pricing & Manufacturing
Add all this up and the 2019 Ram Heavy Duty is a tool you can use and trust; around home and to and from the job site. Or, in my case, towing a race car to and from the local track. Starting MSRP varies greatly: between $35,000 and $90,000 depending on trim level and preferred options.
The 2019 Ram Heavy Duty is built at the Saltillo Truck Assembly Plant in Coahuila, Mexico.

2019/04/04,2020 Acura TLX: Letting Those Colors Fly!,"From nano pigments to powerful engines, the 2020 Acura TLX has a lot going for it.
Starting MSRP is fairly modest, although there are plenty of ways to upgrade the car. 
The Acura/ELS premium stereo is good for all kinds of music, from Metallica to Manilow. 
No Aprils Fools joke here! The 2020 Acura TLX arrives with a long list of premium features, four new exterior colors, and two performance-inspired powertrains. According to data from Urban Science, the TLX outpaced segment competition from BMW, Lexus, Audi, and Infiniti in retail sales last year. Acura is certinately aiming for that crown again with the 2020 TLX.
Let’s take a brief walk around and see what’s in store.
Let Those Colors Fly
An already sharp car, the 2020 Acura TLX receives four new premium paints: Performance Red Pearl (yes!), Majestic Black Pearl (oh baby!), Canyon Bronze Metallic (hold the phone!), and an A-Spec exclusive Apex Blue Pearl (swoon!). These coats are not just slathered on either; Acura gives them the deluxe treatment during final assembly. State-of-the-art pigmentation techniques are applied to the micas, metal flakes, and nano pigments, the latter of which Acura notes as “super-high transparency.”
Furthermore, each color benefits from additional coats to enhance intensity, depth, and luster. This means after the final swipe of the chamois cloth, the 2020 Acura TLX should shine like Spica.
Related: Quick and composed: on the road with the Acura TLX A-Spec.
Power & Performance: The Motherload
The 2020 Acura TLX offers two engines: a 2.4-liter i-VTEC with 206 horsepower, or a 3.5-liter i-VTEC V6 with 290 horses. The former comes with an eight-speed dual clutch transmission, versus the latter with its nine-speed auto. Both engines employ direct injection to increase overall performance and efficiency, although the V6 does feature Acura’s Variable Cylinder Management system.
Front-wheel drive configurations benefit from Acura’s Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS). The system offers better low-speed maneuverability and high-speed stability by allowing precise left and right-rear-wheel toe angle control. The result should make the 2020 Acura TLX feel smooth, be it through a parking lot or over the highway.
Optional for the TLX V6 is Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD). It’s not the most creative name but we give Acura props for being blunt. SH-AWD does exactly what it says: makes the handling superb. For example, SH-AWD allows up to 70 percent of the available torque to be distributed to the rear wheels; and up to 100 percent of that torque to be transferred to either the right-rear or left-rear wheel. This type of power transfer creates a stronger sense of control, balance, and agility, regardless of weather conditions.

Infotainment & Technology For Days
Toss on the Barry Manilow (don’t judge) because the 2020 TLX comes with a 10-speaker Acura/ELS Studio audio system. According to Business Insider, it’s one of the best on the market. Complementing said stereo is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Pandora and Aha compatibility, SiriusXM, and an auxiliary input jack. Now, our recommendation is Barry Manilow II from 1974 but they’re all good.
Bonus points if you name your 2020 TLX “Mandy.”
Elsewhere on the tech front is the AcuraWatch suite of advanced safety gizmos. The robust package includes things like collision mitigation braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane-keeping assist among others. The available 360-degree surround view camera provides an extra set of eyes for those busy parking lots.
Related: Sporty and budget-friendly: meet the 2019 Acura ILX.
A-Spec In The House
When the TLX goes A-Spec it becomes more sporty and athletic. In our minds, it’s hard to justify a TLX without an A-Spec package; it really adds a new dimension. Treatments on the front include a matte-black diamond grille with a dark chrome border, and a more aggressive lower fascia with LED fog lights. Out back, the A-Spec adds a gloss-black spoiler, “smoked” LED taillights, and four-inch round dual exhaust finishers.
The 19-inch Shark Gray wheels are wrapped with 245/40-series tires, an A-Spec exclusive.
Inside, the TLX A-Spec features aggressively bolstered front seats with high-contrast stitching and piping, and plenty of brushed aluminum trim throughout. Interior themes include a black leather array with Alcantara inserts; or if you’re feeling really fiery and feisty, full-on red leather. Red ambient lighting adds to the interior warmth.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Acura TLX is available now for a starting MSRP of $33,995. The premium paint colors mentioned above are an additional $400.

2019/04/03,2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback: The Bulldog For The Budget-Minded,"The 2020 Toyota Yaris is ideal for anyone living on a strict budget. 
It packs a lot of punch with a peppy engine and plenty of connectivity.
Safety features are numerous, including three advanced braking systems.
We no sooner take the 2019 Yaris sedan on an extensive test drive, and Toyota is already previewing the 2020 Yaris Hatchback! Zipping through Denver and around the mountain curves outside the city, the 2019 Yaris is a blast to drive. The little car hugged the road and entertained us with its six-speaker sound system. For around $20,000, it’s hard to beat. And by all accounts thus far, the 2020 Toyota Yaris will be as well.
Setting The Stage
Toyota describes it as the physical representation of the modern hatchback formula; meaning a fun, efficient, and affordable car. With the 2019 Yaris, we were impressed by the amount of standard features, something not readily expected given the price point. The general assumption is an inexpensive car warrants the bare bones in terms of features and technology. While the 2020 Toyota Yaris certainly won’t contain what a Lexus will, the automaker is still hoping to surprise us with just how much they can stuff in the little cruiser.
Case and point: there’s even a first aid kit inside the 2020 Yaris Hatchback.
Technology On Tap
The 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback receives a seven-inch touchscreen and a display audio system that runs through six speakers. Connectivity treatments include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, voice recognition, USB ports, and an auxiliary input for various devices. Drivers can control the phone and audio functions from the steering wheel. The XLE trim receives a leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob, and parking brake.
LE and XLE grades now have navigation, although an accessory SD card must be purchased through the dealer to activate it. Navigation is a fine addition to the 2020 Toyota Yaris, despite the extra cost. (Hopefully it won’t be too expensive).
Premium Treatments
Every 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback comes with 16-inch aluminum alloy wheels, body-color side mirrors and door handles, and a chrome tailpipe tip. The heated and power-adjustable outside mirrors have built-in LED turn signals. Other standard features include keyless entry, push-button start, and a backup camera. Automatic climate control, rain-sensing wipers, and automatic LED headlamps are standard on the higher XLE trim.
The Bulldog Bites
The 2020 Yaris Hatchback benefits from a “cab-rearward” design, something Toyota says gives the car its “hunkered-down, bulldog-like stance.” Styling aside, Toyota wants to make sure this puppy can park. The new Yaris has a tight 32.2-ft. turning circle, despite a wheelbase nearly 2.4 inches longer than the prior model. City dwellers will appreciate this, especially as they navigate the grocery store parking lot at 5:30 pm on a Friday with the rest of planet.

2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric: Longer Range & Faster Charging
The 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback is a bulldog with a backbone. For example, the body structure is 65 percent ultra-high tensile strength steel, part of a continuous framework using straight beams wherever possible for maximum strength. Toyota says the higher structural integrity means the MacPherson strut front and torsion-beam rear suspension will yield better driving dynamics. This type of steel-intensive structure will transition to better fuel economy and greater safety as well.
On the steering and braking front, Toyota employs a rigid steering mount for a lighter, more direct feel. The bake pedal is tuned specifically for corners; smooth to the press when entering a turn, then getting stiffer as lateral forces come into play through the corner. During our review of the 2019 Toyota Yaris sedan, we thought the brakes were nicely balanced for daily driving. And that will likely be the same with the 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback.

Safety & Security
One of the bigger concerns with a smaller car like the Yaris is safety. Completing the steel-intensive structure are numerous standard safety features, like Toyota’s Low-speed Pre-collision Safety System. If a potential frontal collision is detected, an audio/visual alert and braking assistance are designed to automatically activate. Should the driver not respond, the system may automatically apply the brakes.
Diving deeper, we see three essential (and standard) braking systems meant to give the smaller Yaris a stronger footprint. Electronic Brake-Force Distribution (EBD) is the first; then Brake Assist, and the Brake Override System.
Electronic Brake-Force Distribution
In so many words, this helps keep a vehicle stable when braking. During a sudden stop, for example,  momentum can cause a vehicle to tilt forward, reducing the braking effectiveness of the rear tires. EBD balances this by redistributing that brake force accordingly. When carrying cargo – say everything from groceries to laundry – sensors recognize the weight on the rear axle. Thus, brake pressure increases on the rear wheels because of the extra weight.
Brake Assist & Brake Override System
In a similar fashion, Brake Assist detects sudden or “panic” braking and applies full pressure in an attempt to mitigate or prevent a collision. The Brake Override System automatically reduces engine power when the brake and accelerator pedal are applied simultaneously under certain conditions.

Power & Performance
An appetite for fun versus fuel! The 2020 Toyota Yaris Hatchback features a 1.5-liter in-line four with 106 horsepower. The high compression ratio (12.0:1) and direct injection system should provide plenty of zip. The six-speed automatic’s torque converter locks in all gears for quicker shifts and better fuel efficiency. And there’s even a Sport Mode!

2019/04/02,2019 VW Arteon: Tremendous Value But Will It Actually Sell?,"The 2019 VW Arteon arrives at dealerships this month.
Front-wheel drive models start at $35,845; $37,645 for all-wheel drive.
VW says the Arteon combines the space of a sedan with the design of a coupe. 
So they’re really making this thing? “This thing” being the 2019 VW Arteon, a top-of-the-line, all bells and whistles halo car VW seems to think everyone wants. Every so often, VW does something like this. They made a Passat with half of a Veyron engine, a W8, 15 years ago. They made this big luxo sedan, the Phaeton, a couple of years after that. Nobody bought them. Why? A couple of good, solid reasons.
So what makes Volkswagen think it’s going to work this time around with the 2019 Arteon?
Lessons Learned?
Near as I could tell, the W8 Passat and the W12 Phaeton failed to hit sales targets for two main reasons. One, when something went wrong with either of those engines (and sooner or later, something always did), it’s like you had to suddenly write a check for a new sailboat. And two, why buy a top-of-the-line VW loaded with every possible performance and luxury feature on the planet, when, for a few dollars more, you could buy nearly the same thing from BMW or Mercedes-Benz or Audi – shoot, Audis are pretty much Volkswagens already!
But whatever, VW does not seem concerned with those questions, but they do seem concerned with people knowing about the Arteon.
Value Proposition
So here we are. The Arteon (I will not make a comment on that name, no I will not) is loaded down with every high-tech means to move you, stop you, change directions for you and, in the meantime, keep you warm and dry and safe and happy. VW says the Arteon will do this for . . . holy smokes, this thing only costs $36,000?! That’s nuts. That’s about what an Audi A4 goes for, and the Arteon has all the features of an A8 (okay, an A6 at least).
In other words, VW is going down the same road it did with the W8 Passat and W12 Phaeton; lots of bang for your buck, but nobody bought them.
Here’s what you get for that $36,000 starting price (they top out around $45,000 for the full-zoot model). There are three trim levels: the SE, SEL, and SEL Premium. Even the “base” SE has most anything a modern luxo-barge buyer would want these days.
2019 VW Arteon SE
The front-wheel drive Arteon SE, starting at $35,845, features a 2.0L four-cylinder turbocharged TSI engine. Not very impressive in the engine department, sure, but everything else is. For an extra two grand you can get an Arteon SE with 4Motion all-wheel drive. Standard exterior goodies include 18-inch aluminum wheels, LED headlights and taillights, a chrome grille, and dual trapezoidal exhaust tips.

On the inside, the SE has leatherette seating surfaces, heated front seats with 12-way power adjust, and four-way lumbar support. Keyless access with push-button start fires the whole thing off, and there’s three-zone automatic climate control for when you’re underway. The SE also comes with a leather-wrapped and multi-function steering wheel, rearview camera, rain-sensing wipers, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The brushed metallic décor bits are all over the place, along with stainless-steel door sills and pedal caps.
There’s tons of multimedia stuff crammed into the dash: an eight-inch Composition Media infotainment system with SiriusXM, Bluetooth connectivity (of course), two USB ports, and eight speakers. Volkswagen’s Car-Net App-Connect includes Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and MirrorLink. Standard driver assist features include Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking, Side Assist, and Rear Traffic Alert.
And all that stuff is in the “entry-level” SE!
Related: An in-depth look at the 2019 VW Arteon.
2019 VW Arteon SEL & Premium
VW ups the game with the Arteon SEL, which starts at $39,995 for front-wheel drive; $41,795 for all-wheel drive, neither of which are unreasonable. The standard LED headlights now have an Adaptive Front-lighting System. There’s a panoramic sunroof, power-folding mirrors with memory, remote start, Nappa leather seating surfaces, and ambient lighting. This time, it’s an eight-inch Discover Media infotainment system with navigation and a 12.3-inch Volkswagen Digital Cockpit display.
There’s also Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go along for the ride.
At the top of the heap, we have the Arteon SEL Premium starting at $44,945. The SEL Premium, riding on 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, is only available with all-wheel drive. The interior receives a heated steering wheel, paddle shifters, ventilated front seats with a massaging driver’s seat, heated rear seats, and again, brushed aluminum décor all over the place. The 700-watt Dynaudio stereo with 12 speakers should be loud enough to make even Nikki Sixx want to turn it down.
A Great Vehicle Indeed
So yes, the new Volkswagen Arteon is an amazing car, loaded down with features you’d expect in something costing twice as much. And yes, the 2019 VW Arteon would be the smart choice concerning cost versus value. But no, VW probably won’t end up selling enough of them. More’s the pity. They seem like great cars.

2019/03/29,AutoSens Returning To Detroit: Conference Plays Vital Role In Autonomous Tech,"AutoSens, a leading and influential global summit on autonomous driving, is returning to Detroit.
Technical sessions and presentations from from Microsoft, Sony, General Motors, and MIT are planned.
AutoSens takes aim at the biggest challenges facing autonomous driving by encouraging collaboration. 
Not long ago, self-driving cars were figments of science fiction; the ideal centerpiece of a quasi-Utopian yet technologically-advanced society in the far away future. For over a century, we humans have piloted our own automobiles to theaters and bookstores alike to indulge our imaginations with these stories of a distant time. Yet, the reality is different. Self-driving cars? “Not in my lifetime,” one might say.
But you’d be surprised what you might see in your lifetime.
Big Dreams & Grand Visions
Autonomous cars are no longer science fiction but science fact. They are coming to our roads; it’s only a matter of time. However, the decisions we make now as an industry beforehand are vitally important. Because once they’re here, they’re here. And consumers are already skeptical of the technology. We either get it right now or we pay a substantial price in the long run. Indeed, there are many concerns, from the supply chain and infrastructure, to the legal and financial. Yet the biggest should be this: if our autonomous cars miscalculate, someone dies.
When our goals, as an industry, include zero traffic fatalities, it’s not hard to see why right now matters. And one of the best ways to achieve such a remarkable goal? By working with and learning from each other.
Content & Collaboration
These are central themes of AutoSens, and why it remains the world’s most influential summit on autonomous driving. When AutoSens returns to Detroit on May 14th, the conference will explore the biggest challenges facing autonomous cars. By combining cutting-edge academic research, industry R&D, and OEM insights, AutoSens is an invaluable resource for the engineering community.
“Engineers can ‘take the boxing gloves off’ for three days and just be engineers and scientists working on shared challenges and pursuing high-quality technical work,” said Robert Stead, Managing Director, Sense Media, the parent company of AutoSens. “We strive for high-quality technical presentations at AutoSens every year, so all attendees will go back to their office or lab with some new solutions, food for thought, or novel information.”
Organizers say returning to Detroit is essential when it comes to facilitating those types of outcomes.
“From sensors to software; systems to simulation, hardware, testing and services; there’s plenty to see over the three days,” Stead continued. “Detroit has the dual advantage of its history and future potential; recent developments combined with the scale of the existing automotive expertise in the region makes it the perfect melting pot for discussions driving the future of automotive product development.”

Robust Agenda
The Michigan Science Center will host AutoSens Detroit for the second year with another robust agenda. Highlights include the opening plenary with presentations from the U.S. Highway Loss Data Institute on the impact of current ADAS technologies on road safety. Technical workshops include a session from Osram about infra-red sensing and a hands-on demonstration from 3M regarding material-sensor interaction systems. Microsoft will host a tutorial on the Robot Operating System, while DeepScale will present energy-efficient approaches to autonomous driving.
“The technical presentations focus on these topics, but we also cover the wider issues facing development of ADAS and autonomous vehicles in the conference plenary sessions that open and close the event,” Stead said. “This might include the regulatory, financial, or legal context for the development of vehicle perception systems.”
“I would say the biggest challenge for people is trying to understand the different technologies,” explained Phil Magney, Founder and Principal Advisor, VSI Labs, during AutoSens Detroit last year. “This conference has been good for us because we meet like-minded people that are facing similar challenges; we talk, we exchange our views, and we learn from each other.”
Going Deeper
Those curious to learn more about the inner-workings of an autonomous car will be in good company. For example, the Detroit Autonomous Vehicle Group is planning a hackathon for future engineers to learn the basics of self-driving cars. As is common at AutoSens, attendees can see how an autonomous car works, piece by piece.
“By this we mean the sensors, cables, processors, other hardware and software that give a vehicle’s computer a picture of its environment so it can make decisions,” Stead explained. “These technologies are applied in many currently available road-going models, but they are also used in R&D for more advanced systems that will hit the market in the future, including fully autonomous vehicles.”
“We wanted to talk to the sensor companies because cars are getting a larger chunk of sensors now, especially for advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous applications, and for next-generation cockpits,” said Soshun Arai, Director of ADAS and Automated Driving Platform Strategy for the company. Arai and his team attended AutoSens Detroit last year to look more specifically at the individual components that affect their overall business.
“We came to AutoSens because we wanted to understand the technology and trends of sensors,” he said.
For Engineers, By Engineers
Keynote for AutoSens Detroit this year is Ed Bernardon, VP of Strategic Automotive Initiatives at Siemens. Bernardon will examine how autonomous technology will impact the future of transportation. In preparation, he and his team interviewed experts working on 3D-printed autonomous shuttles, intelligent traffic systems, and even flying cars. In addition, technical presentations from General Motors, Changan, Aptiv, Daimler, NVIDIA, Valeo, Sony, and TomTom are planned. Academic sessions include those hosted by Wayne State University, University of South Carolina, and MIT.

“AutoSens exists simply to support and help engineers and scientists, and when we hear stories from attendees about the new people they met, the things they learned, the business connections made – that’s what keeps us motivated,” Stead said. “It’s about creating a meeting place and community that can be a catalyst for others, in their pursuit of good science.”
For conference organizers, sometimes it’s about what attendees won’t experience.
“I’ve run more conferences than I can remember during my 14-year career in this sector, and sadly I’ve seen some of them suffer from an overly protective and pushy sales approach,” Stead continued. “I can understand the individual motivations for this, but it’s counterproductive at learning and networking events like this.”
“It’s a great community and we are very happy to be part of this ecosystem; it’s an excellent event,” added Paul Fleck, Founder of Dataspeed.
Tickets, Location & More Information
AutoSens Detroit 2019 begins on Tuesday, May 14th at the Michigan Science Center and runs through the 16th. Organizers say they are happy to see so many returning exhibitors alongside plenty of new brands. A demonstration event is also planned for the 14th, where attendees can take laps in vehicles equipped with autonomous technology.
Tickets, including discount packages for females in the engineering community, are available now.
“AutoSens is all about nurturing the global community of bright minds who are driving forward this revolution in automotive,” Stead said. “A truly international audience will assemble in downtown Detroit to collaborate and learn from each other’s experiences, meet new people, and catch up with old friends.”

2019/03/26,Nissan IMQ Concept: The Future of Hybrid Crossovers Is In Good Hands,"The IMQ concept is Nissan’s vision for the future of transportation. 
The concept’s styling and design is inspired by Japanese kumiko woodwork.
Invisible-to-Visible (I2V) technology is one of the IMQ concept’s top safety features. 
Nissan is riding high on the success of the Nissan Leaf. We give credit when it’s due, so kudos to Nissan for being one of the EV pioneers in the industry. And while the Nissan IMx and IMS electric vehicles are still fresh in the minds of Nissan lovers alike, the Japanese car maker is singing a different tune with the IMQ concept hybrid crossover.
Yes, it’s a hybrid. And a pretty one at that.
Taking The Stage
The Nissan IMQ concept made quite an impression during the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show. Because unlike other concept vehicles with ridiculous features and polarizing designs, the IMQ concept feels – for lack of a better word – closer to reality. Now, we all know how concepts turn from good to not-so-good when the production version hits the shelves, so it’s better to calm your appetite until we get to the juicy parts.
But if by some stroke of magic Nissan infuses the design cues of the IMQ in the production model, then I’m all in. From the looks of it, it seems the future of hybrid crossovers is in good hands.

Stealth Attack Fighter
This is where it gets interesting. Where the Nissan IMx crossover and IMS sedan carry the familiar V-motion grille, the IMQ Concept is brandishing a different face; and it’s all for the better. I find nothing wrong with the front face of the IMx and IMS, but the IMQ Concept is the most desirable among the three.
And it has to be. The IMQ Concept marks a bold new direction in Nissan’s design language. The new V-motion grille is more subtle and blends vertically into the sharper hood. It also wraps in the front bumper horizontally, creating outer edges similar to what you see in the F-117A Nighthawk stealth attack fighter. The windshield wraps around the body with ultra-thin A-pillars and no B-pillars, which necessitates the use of rear suicide doors.
On some angles, the Nissan IMQ looks like the lovechild of a Nissan GT-R and Lexus RX Hybrid. From the rear, it manages to resemble the BMW X6, but in a better way. There’s a vertical character line that drops from the “boomerang” light clusters to literally split the air as it passes down the side. This not only improves aerodynamic performance, but it gives the crossover the gait of a much sportier vehicle.

See those darkened lower sections in the body? Those are detailed layers called “lamellas” and are splattered all over the exterior. Not sure if this feature makes it to production, but it shows the traditional Japanese side of Nissan.

Driven by e-POWER
The Nissan IMQ concept may be a hybrid, but it’s a different breed of hybrid. For one thing, it comes with Nissan’s next-generation e-POWER electric motor drive system. Now we can nerd on this tech all day, but I’ll make it simple: e-POWER allows you to experience the sensation of driving an EV without worrying about charging the damn thing.
The vehicle comes with four electric motors at each wheel. Nissan claims a combined output of 335 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. of torque. It also comes with a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline mill to charge the battery pack, although why you’ll need a turbo for this purpose is beyond me – maybe to “super-charge” or “turbo-charge” the charging, perhaps?
And since all four wheels have their respective motors, the power is channeled directly to a new multi-motor all-wheel drive system. This allows the IMQ concept to deliver precise and independent control of each wheel. This means conquering snowy, rocky, or rougher patches of tarmac; because nobody said you can’t go off-roading in a hybrid. The upcoming Jeep Renegade and Compass plug-in hybrids are proof of that.
Of course, no concept SUV is complete without a set of evocative 22-inch alloy wheels and smart tires. If the Imagine by Kia Concept came with Goodyear Intelligrip EV concept tires, the Nissan IMQ makes do with bespoke Bridgestone Connect tires. The rollers transmit data to the vehicle ECU to precisely calibrate the performance of the vehicle. Cool stuff, but I’m wondering how much it costs to fix a puncture in these tires?

Technological Showcase: A Throwback
If the exterior emanates a high-tech presence, wait until you get inside. The controls and displays are clearly oriented toward the driver. It has a humongous 33-inch digital display (take that, Tesla!) along with a secondary screen above the center console. Even the steering wheel is not spared from the modern touch. Just look at that thing. It’s like piloting the Millennium Falcon in there, which 40-year-old kids will surely appreciate.
RELATED

Technological Showcase: Innovative Safety
But the biggest tech showcase in the Nissan IMQ concept is not the outrageously huge display or the funky tiller. The distinction belongs to Nissan’s Invisible-to-Visible (I2V) Technology. It merges the real world with the virtual one. It allows the driver to see through buildings, obstacles, and larger objects. This helps you see better around corners and intersections to prevent and reduce accidents. Again, we can salivate like geeks, because this is space-age tech.
Nissan’s innovative safety feature utilizes Omni-Sensing technology to collect “real-world sensing information,” both inside and outside the cabin. The vehicle also benefits from Nissan’s ProPilot Assist system via the barrage of sensors, radars, and cameras located throughout the vehicle.
[bctt tweet=”It’s like piloting the Millennium Falcon in there, which 40-year-old kids will surely appreciate.” username=”Automoblog”]
Next-Generation Nissan Crossover
So far, so good. The Nissan IMQ Concept is clearly targeted at a different niche. It’s a hybrid crossover for those who aren’t ready to take the full-EV plunge. Whether all this makes it to production is the million dollar question.
We’ll just have to wait and see.

2019/03/25,Alfa Romeo Tonale: When Concepts Cars Become Social Creatures,"The Tonale concept is Alfa Romeo’s first plug-in hybrid and premium compact SUV.
Styling elements include throwbacks to the brand’s history but take into account future designs.     
New infotainment features allow drivers to be “fully connected” to the social communities around them.
Normally, if you try and cram too many interesting things together into one package, it ends up being a mish-mash and the end product isn’t very good. For example, if you try to combine a plug-in hybrid with a premium, compact SUV it might not work. Add to that mix Alfa Romeo, and you’d think you’d be heading down the wrong road. But check out the new Alfa Romeo Tonale concept from the recent Geneva International Motor Show.
It’s a compact SUV that’s easy on gas and even easier on the eyes.
The Showcase Car
First off, this is a show car, so don’t get your hopes up. Secondly, this isn’t a totally radical show car powered by stellar gasses filtered through rare earth substrates. The Tonale seems to be more of a showcase car than a show car, so maybe do get your hopes up. What Alfa has done here is demonstrate two things: One, you can have an SUV-like vehicle that is stylish and, two, a lot of the stuff you find within the Tonale you could easily find in other Alfas.
A lot could be said about the overall design and styling of the Tonale. And Lord knows I could say it, but I really hesitate to go into that sort of thing. Whether a car looks “good” or not is ultimately up to you and your eyes. What can be said is that Italians have a real gift for making even mundane vehicles (like SUV/crossovers) look like the hottest thing to come down the road since forever. To my eyes, this is a really well done car. The surface tension harks back to Alfa styling moves of the past  – the Brera-like headlights, big phone dial wheels and such – all show that while German and Japanese car designers struggle to make stuff work, Italians do it without breaking a sweat.

At Your Fingertips
Where the Tonale gets more concrete is on the inside. Not so much the styling, but what Alfa has decided to pack in there. Where modern cars currently are with concern to dashboards is becoming well-established. Screens are ideal, if not outright required. Fancy touchscreens and multi-function displays are no longer confined to the Rolls Royces and Bentleys of the world. So, if they are everywhere now, what will our dashboards of the near future look like and how will they function?
RELATED

Alfa thinks it can answer that question.
The Tonale features a 12.3-inch, full-digital cluster and a 10.25-inch touchscreen in the central head unit. The main instrument cluster does what you’d expect, measuring speed, revs, and vehicle status stuff, while the big screen in the center handles all the infotainment. That’s pretty standard. What Alfa concentrates on is, of all things, the UI and software to make a seamless and fluid interface. Thus, multitasking becomes easier, more intuitive, and natural. Alfa says the driver will have all the latest features and functionality readily available at their fingertips.
And here’s where Alfa goes over the top, saying the Tonale allows you to be fully connected to the Alfa Romeo Lifestyle and Social communities through features like “Alfista” and “Paddock.”
Entering The World of Alfa Romeo
Alfista is an “immersive” Alfa Romeo Lifestyle experience. Which kind of makes me shudder. When Alfa tries to explain itself, it doesn’t make me feel any better. Alfista aims to connect you with select Alfa Romeo clubs and community events. You know, get togethers, gatherings, drives and such; you receive live news and updates about all that as well as the current happenings of the Alfa Romeo brand. Ugh. It’s not a completely bad idea, but I don’t see why your car has to do what your phone already does.
Paddock is the “in-vehicle garage and market.” Paddock allows for the real-time viewing and purchasing of all the latest interior and exterior performance upgrades, equipment, and Alfa Romeo merchandise and apparel. All of which can be ordered direct via the touchscreen. Again, this makes me ask why you should do this with your car and not your phone.
What Alfa is pointing to here, however, is interesting. The problem is they are trying to tie their software to their hardware. What they should be doing is providing Alfista and Paddock to customers as a software download for their phones. Watch, I bet Alfa ends up doing that anyway in a few years. Alfista and Paddock are good ideas, just delivered through the wrong medium.
Power & Performance: Slim Details But Promising
Sadly, Alfa does not give many technical details on the drivetrain, other than to mention the obvious. It’s a full-on, plug-in hybrid system. You can run on electricity or gasoline or both, and you can charge the batteries by hooking up to the grid. What Alfa does say is that they’ve tweaked the software so that as you drive the Tonale – or any other future hybrid with this system – you can go from electric to gasoline without noticing where the power is coming from. No need to worry, the Tonale figures it out for you. Just aim your nose down the via and go!
RELATED

They say it still drives and feels like an Alfa Romeo (i.e. a total blast) but it’s now much more eco-conscious on your behalf.
“The Tonale marks the debut of the brand in the premium compact utility vehicle segment and does so in line with the characteristics that have always identified each Alfa Romeo model,” reads a statement from the company. “The goal is to deliver the best driving dynamics in the segment and to apply electrification in perfect Alfa Romeo style.”
Strangely, this mish-mash of stuff that shouldn’t work at all sounds really good to me.

2019/03/22,2020 Porsche Cayenne Coupe: Now With “Broader Shoulders”,"The 2020 Porsche Cayenne Coupe has a lower profile than the normal Cayenne. 
Two engines are available, including a more powerful and turbocharged V8.
Porsche says to expect the new Cayenne Coupe in the U.S. later this fall. 
Porsche is extending the Cayenne model line with a new Coupe body style. Highlights include sharper lines, an adaptive rear spoiler, individual rear seats, and either a standard panoramic fixed-glass roof, or an optional carbon fiber roof. The 2020 Porsche Cayenne Coupe also has a Turbo variant for those wanting a few more ponies.
“The Coupe includes all the technical highlights of the current Cayenne, but has an even more dynamic design and new technical details that position it as more progressive, athletic, and emotional,” said Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG.
Broad Shoulders & Sport Seats
Porsche’s designers went for an athletic and dynamic look. For example, the front windshield and A-pillar are shallower versus the Cayenne; the roof edge is roughly 0.78 inches lower than the standard design. The rear doors and quarter panels also receive a makeover in an effort to “broaden the shoulders.” Even the licence plate bracket gets special treatment. It’s now part of the bumper, making it look as if the Cayenne Coupe sits lower to the ground.
Cayenne Coupe drivers will enjoy the eight-way Sport Seats that offer generous lateral support, according to Porsche. In the rear, the Coupe receives a bench but with characteristics of individual seats. Rear passengers sit 1.18 inches lower than in the Cayenne, meaning headroom is unaffected despite the lower profile. Cargo volume is 22 cubic feet and increases to 54.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.
By comparison, the Cayenne Turbo Coupe has 21.2 feet with the rear seats standing; 53.3 cubic feet folded.
Power & Performance
The Cayenne Coupe features the same 3.0-liter mono-turbo V6 as the standard Cayenne, generating 335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft. of torque. The standard Coupe hits 60 in 5.7 seconds; 5.6 seconds with Porsche’s optional lightweight-sport packages. By comparison, the Cayenne Turbo Coupe employs a 4.0-liter, twin-turbo V8 with 541 horsepower and 567 lb-ft. of torque. The Turbo Coupe hits 60 in 3.7 seconds with a top speed of 178 mph.
All Cayenne Coupe models come with the Sport Chrono Package standard. For the Cayenne Turbo Coupe, Porsche’s Sport Exhaust System is available.
The current Cayenne Turbo was the first Porsche to feature an adaptive roof spoiler, something the new Cayenne Coupe adopts. Every Cayenne Coupe receives both the roof spoiler and an adaptive rear spoiler as part of the Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA) package. The spoiler extends by 5.3 inches to increase downforce to the rear axle at speeds above 56 mph.

2019/03/22,2020 Hyundai Sonata: When Beauty Is Beyond Skin-Deep,"Hyundai’s new platform for the 2020 Sonata enhances the sedan’s safety.
The 2020 Sonata is the first model in Hyundai’s lineup to utilize the platform.
Hyundai will expand the new platform to include other vehicles in their portfolio. 
Sensuous Sportiness design concept. Try saying that three times fast! Despite the phrase being a tongue twister, it’s the inspiration behind the 2020 Hyundai Sonata. Last year, at the Geneva International Motor Show, Hyundai revealed how their future cars might look with the Le Fil Rouge concept. “Sensuous Sportiness” was the Le Fil Rouge’s central theme, united by four distinct traits: proportion, architecture, styling, and technology.
Ultra-Wide, Layered & Long
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata is sharp and sporty, its refined dimensions giving it an edge over its predecessor. For example, the new Sonata drops by 30 mm yet receives a width extension of 25 mm. The wheelbase grows by 35 mm, as does the car’s entire length by 45 mm. At the rear, the “ultra-wide” taillights convey a sense of width and breadth. We could spend more time pouring over the technical design details, but the big takeaways are the layered (and long) hood, low stance, and sleek roofline. These elements bring home the styling of the 2020 Hyundai Sonata.
“A short overhang, sloping roofline, and low deck lid create a balanced feel, and Hyundai’s signature chrome accent now goes all the way into the hood, making it look even longer,” said Sang Yup Lee, Senior Vice President and head of the Hyundai Design Center. “These cues bring the Sensuous Sportiness design to life.”
But the real sweetness is hidden from view.
Essential Foundations
The 2020 Hyundai Sonata floats down the road on the automaker’s latest vehicle platform. The new Sonata’s foundation is lighter to improve fuel efficiency and handling; the center of gravity drops and lateral stiffness increases, both of which accentuate the Sonata’s handling. Considering the Sonata is an ideal family car, crash protection is paramount. Thus, the new platform employs super-high tensile strength steel and hot stamping. Further, the new platform benefits from a multi-load path structure to better absorb and redirect crash energy.
Testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety finds small overlap crashes often bypass a typical vehicle’s main front structure. IIHS commonly finds that small overlap crashes on the driver’s side force that tire rearward and into the footwell. This increases the chances of leg and foot injuries because the “intrusion” of an exterior component is now greater. With Hyundai’s new platform, the Sonata’s tires now move outward during small overlap collisions. This change should, in theory, lessen such intrusions, while reducing the likelihood of uncontrolled spins, during an accident, that cause secondary collisions.
The hot stamping also mitigates “deformation” of the interior, meaning the vehicle’s body is less likely to intrude on the occupants during an accident.
Sailing On The Smartstream
On the performance front, we run into another tongue twister in Hyundai’s “Smartstream Powertrain.” The automaker says this was done to accommodate a possible application of a “next-generation engine,” but as far as the new platform is concerned, it’s about aerodynamics and cooling. For example, the platform directs air to the engine bay for better heat dissipation, while minimizing air resistance around the Sonata’s lower body.
Future Plans
Hyundai says they will expand the new platform to future vehicles. Applying it across their range will help the automaker stay competitive by allowing for greater flexibility during vehicle and product development. On the consumer end, however, the immediate benefits will come in terms of efficiency and safety.
Expect the 2020 Hyundai Sonata stateside this fall.

2019/03/21,New Volvo Tech Could Intervene During Distracted & Intoxicated Driving,"Volvo’s new monitoring system aims to reduce the impacts of distracted and impaired driving.
The technology allows the vehicle to automatically intervene if a driver fails to respond to warnings.
As part of a larger conversation, Volvo asks if automakers have an obligation to produce such technology. 
Volvo is showcasing new technology that may prevent fatal accidents involving impairment, speeding, and distraction. The automaker is doubling down on their vision of a future with zero traffic fatalities, saying it’s necessary to address these three main “gaps.” This news follows Volvo’s more recent announcement about limiting the top speed on all their cars to 111 mph starting in 2021.
Volvo says they want to start a conversation about whether automakers have the right, or maybe even the obligation to install technology that can change a drivers’ behavior.
“When it comes to safety, our aim is to avoid accidents altogether rather than limit the impact when an accident is imminent and unavoidable,” explained Henrik Green, Senior Vice President, Research & Development at Volvo Cars. “In this case, cameras will monitor for behavior that may lead to serious injury or death.”
What The Data Shows
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, nearly 30 percent of all traffic fatalities in 2017 involved intoxicated driving. Further data from the National Safety Council determined around 80,000 total roadway deaths occurred in the United States through 2017 and 2018. The latest statistics reflect a slow leveling off, with the number of fatalities in the first six months of 2018 dipping slightly. (Less than 0.5 percent from six-month 2017 estimates).
However, experts believe it may only be a “stabilization” of the largest two-year increase in over 50 years; between 2014 and 2016.
“When it comes to this leading cause of accidental death, we aren’t making progress – we’re treading water,” said Ken Kolosh, Manager of Statistics, National Safety Council. “We cannot accept more than 18,700 deaths as the price of mobility.”
Proactive Approach
Volvo believes fatal accidents involving intoxication and distraction can be addressed via cameras and sensors that monitor the driver. If an impaired driver does not respond to warning signals, and is risking an accident, the vehicle can automatically intervene. Intervention measures include automatically limiting the car’s speed, alerting the Volvo on Call service and, as a final course of action, actively slowing down and safely parking the car.
“There are many accidents that occur as a result of intoxicated drivers,” said Trent Victor, Professor of Driver Behavior at Volvo Cars. “Some people still believe that they can drive after having had a drink, and that this will not affect their capabilities. We want to ensure that people are not put in danger as a result of intoxication.”

Recognizing Patters
Volvo’s driver monitoring system looks for certain telltale signs involving distracted and intoxicated driving. For example, a lack of steering inputs for extended periods of time, extreme weaving across lanes, and slow reaction times. The system even detects if a driver closes or takes their eyes off the road for too long. Volvo’s technology could intervene if say a driver is texting behind the wheel.
“It takes on average 4.6 seconds to send a text message,” said Special First Lieutenant and Traffic Safety Specialist Jim Flegel of the Michigan State Police. “At 55 mph, that is like driving the length of a football field blindfolded.”
According to NHTSA, distracted driving accounted for 3,450 deaths in 2016. The Traffic Safety Facts Research Note on Distracted Driving, also conducted by NHTSA, found drivers under the age of 20 had the highest proportion of distraction-related fatal crashes in 2015.
Implementation & Future Considerations
Volvo plans to introduce the cameras starting in 2020. The camera’s position, location, and number thereof is still being determined. In the meantime, experts say driving defensively is the best way to stay safe on the road. Always buckle up, ignore text messages, obey all posted signs, and designate a sober driver.
“The sad part is that 100 percent of crashes related to distracted and intoxicated driving are preventable,” Flegel said.

2019/03/18,Imagine By Kia: New Concept Electric Aims To Please The Senses,"This car/SUV/crossover is the first pure-electric vehicle from Kia. 
The familiar Kia “tiger nose” makes way for the “tiger mask” front design. 
Kia unveiled the “Imagine by Kia” concept at the Geneva International Motor Show.
Ah yes, another concept EV. The Imagine by Kia is the South Korean car maker’s first-ever, pure-electric four-door car. It fuses the design attributes of a muscular SUV, athletic family saloon, and a versatile crossover.
I have no idea how Kia did it, but the initial results are satisfying, to say the least. It didn’t take long to discern that Kia is serious about coming up with better-looking cars.
Case in point, the Kia Stinger GT.
And with the Imagine by Kia Concept EV, we can rest in the knowledge that future electric cars will have none of the weird and polarizing quirkiness of early hybrids and electric vehicles. I’m looking at you, first-gen Nissan Leaf and Peugeot iOn! Thankfully, Nissan has moved on from the dreary first-gen Leaf to the more normal-looking second-gen car. Sadly, Peugeot remains stuck in the past with the iOn, which remains to be a rebadged Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric car.
And this is where we see Kia trying to break that mold in terms of styling.
SUV Design Cues, Compact Size
Sport-utility vehicles are so popular that a large majority of concept cars are now carrying SUV design cues. Consider the recent Infiniti QX Inspiration Concept. That vehicle is Infiniti’s first foray in the EV segment, and it’s an SUV! Kia is doing something similar here. But instead of being an actual SUV, the Imagine by Kia is a large C-segment car. Think Nissan Sentra, Volkswagen Golf, and Toyota Corolla. Or in Kia world, the Forte.
“It hints at something familiar but is something entirely new,” said Gregory Guillaume, Vice President of Design, Kia Motors Europe, about the Imagine by Kia. “I think of it as a category-buster, and a disruptor – it’s familiar and understood but at the same time progressive and new.”
Instead of the familiar three-box design layout, the Imagine by Kia is styled like a crossover. At some angles, this concept resembles a Stinger on steroids. However, in the front, the Imagine by Kia is oozing with old school charm. If you squint, the new “tiger mask” front has the aura of the Alfa Romeo Montreal and the De Tomaso Mangusta from the 1970s.
“The inspiration for the ‘tiger mask’ was to create the look and feel of the headlamps being suspended within a transparent block of glass,” Guillaume said. “This identifiable lighting signature could potentially be deployed as a unifying design element across Kia’s future electric vehicle range.”

9 Tesla Concepts We Desperately Hope Become Real
Unique Paintwork
In order for the crisp shoulder lines and tautly-drawn sheet metal to further stand out, the Imagine by Kia EV boasts a unique paint job. The car benefits from six layers of chrome-effect silver paint – applied by hand, of course – along with a tanned bronze tint. The result is a surface that is warm and inviting to the touch.
And as you may have figure out by now, the paint is sensitive to changing light conditions. The effect is hard to ignore. The depth of sheen plays with the light as it hits the surface, further enhancing the curves and contours of the vehicle.
“Kia prides itself on its power to surprise, which is why we wanted to move away from the rational and focus on the emotional, and embrace a warmer and more human approach to electrification,” Guillaume added.
Efficient Aerodynamics
Electric vehicles are not just about powerful acceleration and silent driving. These vehicles need to slice the wind like a hot knife over butter to improve real-world driving range. From this aspect, it seems Kia has all the bases covered.
“The front air curtain; the way the double-skin bonnet channels air through the nose, up and over the front screen and roof; the double skinned C-pillar that creates an air spoiler; the completely enclosed underbody; the wind-cheating ‘wingcams’ and the hard-edged break-away around the car’s rear,” Guillaume explained. “All these features collectively boost aerodynamic efficiency and reduce turbulence and drag.”
The same goes for the wheels. Those 22-inch rollers contain inserts crafted from transparent acrylic glass, which will hopefully survive curb damage. The goal is to refract and reflect light as the wheels move while reducing air turbulence. The wheels are shod in Goodyear Intelligrip EV concept tires. The tires have sensors that feed information to the vehicle ECU.
Fascinating Interior
The first thing you’ll notice in the interior of the Imagine by Kia is not the single sheet of glass for the windscreen and roof, nor the floating center console or the rear-hinged suicide doors. While those certainly command attention, they are nothing compared to the immersive front display consisting of 21 individual screens on top of the dashboard. We all know distracted driving is dangerous but this is crazy.
Thankfully, Kia’s design team has a sense of humor after all, which is refreshing for a global car maker.
“Those 21 incredibly thin screens are a humorous and irreverent riposte to the on-going competition between some automotive manufacturers to see who can produce the car with the biggest screen,” explains Ralph Kluge, General Manager of Interior Design, Kia Motors Europe. “We wanted the interior to have a twinkle in its eye, to be full of surprising and delightful touches that amuse, engage, and attract both driver and passenger alike.”

Pure Electric Power
We know for a fact the Imagine by Kia is a pure-electric vehicle. However, Kia is mum on the battery specs and powertrain information. At least for now. What we know so far is how the vehicle benefits from a low-mounted, induction-charged battery pack and compact drivetrain.
Whatever the case, the Imagine by Kia concept has huge shoes to fill. It not only needs to be good, but it needs to be good enough to run with the forthcoming Tesla Model Y, Polestar 2, and Audi Q4 e-tron. This means Kia’s first-ever EV must have a range of 230 to 300 miles and go from zero to 60 mph in less than five seconds.
Kia, I hope you’re reading this.
Future Considerations
Besides the ridiculous screens on the dashboard, Kia is on the right path. But remember, the Imagine by Kia is a concept vehicle. We hope the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree when the production model arrives in the near future.

2019/03/16,Vanquish Vision Concept: Aston Martin Goes Mid-Engine!,"Vanquish Vision Concept is a preview of Aston Martin’s first series production mid-engine supercar.
The decision takes Aston Martin into a mid-engine sector previously defined by other key competitors. 
Aston Martin has been cranking out the concept cars, er, renderings lately. In this instance, we’re talking about the Vanquish Vision Concept. In a lot of ways, it’s both remarkable and unremarkable. Low, sleek, dripping with performance and desirability; it’s everything a concept show car is expected to be. But then you think about it and realize the engine sits in the middle. A mid-engine Aston Martin? Aston doesn’t make mid-engine cars.
Well, they do now.
The Heartland of Luxury Sports Cars
The Vanquish Vision Concept will be one of four mid-engine cars from Aston Martin: The Valkyrie, Valkyrie AMR Pro, AM-RB 003, and the Vanquish Vision (the letter V is flying around Gaydon). Until now, Aston Martins have been very traditional, very British performance cars, with the engine in the front, just the way the Queen and country prefer it. Performance-wise, however, having the lump in the middle is better, so Aston Martin is finally jumping on that old bandwagon and will now start making mid-engine cars.
“Firstly, what a pleasure to revive the Vanquish name. Synonymous with our series production flagships, it felt entirely appropriate to attach it to such a significant car. The Vanquish Vision Concept marks another pivotal moment in Aston Martin’s history, and another critical step in delivering the Second Century Plan,” explained Andy Palmer, Aston Martin Lagonda President and Group CEO. “Our first series production rear mid-engined supercar will be a transformational moment for the brand, for it is the car that will propel Aston Martin into a sector of the market traditionally seen as the heartland of luxury sports cars.”
Related: How Sir David Brown built a car for the “discerning owner driver.”
Less Negative Space
You can think of the Vanquish Vision Concept as sort of a baby Valkyrie, in much the same way a Ferrari 488 is a baby LaFerrari. The latest Vanquish is not as full-blown crazy as the Valkyrie. For example, the Vanquish gets a new V6 plant sitting amidships versus the V12 hybrid monster found in the Valkyrie. (Although that V6 is a non-hybrid, non-turbo version of the same engine found in the AM-RB 003).
So you can see the range of mid-engine Astons as being a spectrum of choice, from the vanilla of the “plain” V6 in the Vanquish, through the spiced up turbo-hybrid of the AM-RB 003, to the full zoot, straitjacket bent of the Valkyrie.

“The Vanquish Vision Concept has a more seductive and less technical appearance than the Aston Martin Valkyrie and AM-RB 003, but it’s still extreme in terms of visual gestures,” said Miles Nurnberger, Aston Martin Director of Design. “For example, it has a very distinctive clamshell front fender, with openings so you can see through onto the tire. There’s less of the negative space that defines the look of the Aston Martin Valkyrie and AM-RB 003. It’s a prettier car, and purposely so, as it’s been designed to thrive in a less extreme performance envelope.”
Sounds like Aston Martin has all the bases covered.
Glued & Screwed
Technical info is rather lacking at this point, sadly. The only gearhead stuff Aston Martin mentions is how the chassis of the Vanquish Vision Concept is a custom-made, bonded aluminum affair, developed by mid-engine specialist and Aston Martin Chief Technical Officer, Max Szwaj. Aston Martin employed a more state-of-the-art, all-carbon fiber construction for both the Valkyrie and AM-RB 003, but went with a more established “glued and screwed” bonded aluminum approach for the Vanquish Vision Concept.
No outright reason is given but, to my experience, it comes down to cost. Carbon fiber is expensive to work with and very expensive to repair (assuming you can repair it). Meaning that insurance costs for a car with a chassis made of metal will be lower. Aston Martin has worked with aluminum for chassis bits and sub-structures in the recent past. For example, the DBS Superleggera utilizes the latest generation of the lightweight bonded aluminum structures first seen on Aston’s DB11. Much like Lotus’ work in the same arena, it shows how a semi-high tech, not exactly bleeding edge approach is still a good path to follow.
“Although it takes Aston Martin into new territory, it does so with the benefit of hard-won knowledge, ground-breaking ideas, and an uncompromising mindset,” Szwaj said. “The full engineering story of this car is yet to be told, but what you see here should tell you this car will not only compete at the highest level, but it will do so in a manner and style unique to Aston Martin.”
Pricing & Production
The Aston Martin Vanquish Vision Concept is scheduled for production in 2022. Although, you know what they say about schedules, especially when it comes to concept cars. No word yet on price. It will likely be less than its other mid-engine stablemates but still more than your house.

2019/03/14,Jeep Electrifies Renegade & Compass With Plug-In Hybrid Powertrains,"The Jeep Renegade and Compass are going green in 2020. 
However, Jeep isn’t exactly jumping on the typical EV bandwagon. 
Both plug-in hybrids feature a revolutionary electric all-wheel drive system.
Jeep found a better way to make a lasting impression at the Geneva International Motor Show recently. The brand unveiled two new plug-in hybrid versions of the Jeep Renegade and Compass for all the world to see.
Yes, you read that right.
After dominating last year’s headlines with the all-new Gladiator pickup truck, Jeep is taking a different route.  I never thought I’d get a chance to say this. But soon, you can order a new Jeep Renegade or Compass with a plug-in hybrid powertrain.
But wait! Before you storm FCA’s headquarters with pitchforks in hand, listen up.
Capturing A Slice of The Growing EV Market
Jeep and Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are on a roll. FCA reported a 14 percent increase in U.S. sales for 2018. The Jeep brand enjoyed a 17 percent increase in sales alone. The Jeep Wrangler, in particular, is a best-seller with 240,032 units sold.
Believe it or not, this has something to do with the rugged, go-anywhere appeal of Jeep vehicles. Mind you, other SUVs are faster, more comfortable, and have more usable space. However, only a select few can offer the clobbering off-road abilities of a Jeep. And a Jeep like this won’t cost more than a loaded midsize sedan.
Naturally, the next step is to go green. In this ever-changing automotive landscape, it’s either go green or go bust. Who would have thought a Jeep would come with an electric motor and battery pack straight from the factory? This is not a surprising move. In fact, Jeep is doing the right thing. If the brand wants to capture a slice of the growing EV market, something needs to be done instead of just harking back to the past.
But rather than jumping straight onto the EV bandwagon, Jeep made the wiser move by engineering a brilliant plug-in hybrid powertrain for the most affordable vehicles in their lineup: the Renegade and Compass. Consider this for a second: both the Jeep Renegade and Jeep Compass have low base prices of $18,000 and $21,000 respectively. Throw in an electric motor and battery pack, raise the base price by $3k to $5k, and you got yourself an eco-friendly, off-road capable, and affordable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV).
Still not convinced? Wait until we get to the juicy parts.
Evolutionary Powertrain
Jeep remains tight-lipped on battery specifications, but the new Renegade and Compass PHEV promise to deliver high power and long range. Similar to other PHEVs, the battery pack is rechargeable from an external power outlet. Both vehicles will have a pure electric range of approximately 31 miles (50 kilometers) and an electric top speed of 80 mph (130 kph).

The electric motor works in unison with a new 1.3-liter turbocharged gasoline motor. Power output for the Jeep Renegade PHEV is around 190 to 240 horsepower. The Jeep Compass PHEV is good for 240 horsepower as well. The result is zero to 60 mph in around seven seconds for both the Renegade and Compass.
Considering a 2017 Jeep Compass Sport 4×4 only musters a zero to 60 time of 8.4 seconds, while a Jeep Renegade 2.4 Sport 4×4 does the same in nine seconds, the PHEV versions offer faster acceleration, better engine response, and cleaner CO2 emissions.

New Electric Drivetrain: Off-Road Capable
What good is a Jeep if it can’t hack it off-road? Fortunately, the Jeep Renegade and Compass PHEV come with an entirely new electric all-wheel drive system or eAWD. This is the kind of stuff you can find on the Audi e-tron SUV. But since the Audi is a full EV, Jeep threw in something different for the PHEV versions of the Renegade and Compass.
Torque in the rear axle comes courtesy of the electric motor (in the rear of the vehicle) while the front axle is turned by the turbocharged gasoline motor. Due to this setup, there is no need to employ a propeller shaft.
As an added bonus, the torque between the two axles is controlled independently as you forge over rocky terrain or snow-covered roads. The eAWD system will not only benefit you off-road, but on the daily drive as well. But since a fully-charged battery pack is good for 31 miles of pure-electric driving, you can tackle the most extreme off-road trails in total silence. And you can do it while basking in the rugged appeal of your Jeep Renegade or Compass.

Pricing & Availability
The new Jeep Renegade and Jeep Compass PHEV will arrive at Jeep dealers in early 2020. Pricing is yet to be announced for either vehicle. If you want to experience hybrid technology in a Jeep, the Wrangler with the mild hybrid eTorque system is available now.

2019/03/13,2019 Toyota Camry Receives Updates Across The Board,"The Camry, one of Toyota’s best-selling cars, soldiers on with new updates for 2019.
Toyota’s Safety Sense P suite provides a number of advanced driver-assistance systems. 
Three powertrain choices are available, including a hybrid with an updated Power Control Unit.
If you’re looking for a car that is the automotive equivalent of a manila envelope stapled to a beige wall, then the new 2019 Toyota Camry is for you. Oh sure, Toyota seems to be serious when they say the Camry has an “Exciting Style” and “Sport Performance” but I’m not ready to believe them. This is a Camry after all. This is solid, dependable, reliable transportation.
Fun and excitement and sportiness have no real place here.
That isn’t a bad thing, per se. If someone were to say that about the latest Porsche, it would be terrible news. We’re talking about Toyota’s bread and butter, middle of the middle-of-the-road vehicle here. In this realm, lack of personality is a good thing. And, in this realm, the latest Camry is packing. Even with its new on-board tech, it gets great gas mileage and is still as reliable as an anvil.
Styling & Design: Some Sporty Elements
The 2019 Toyota Camry carries over the same body design as last year, so there’s not really much to talk about on the styling front. It’s still somewhat sharper, a little wider and lower than you’d first expect, but no one is going to mistake this for an Alfa Romeo Giulia. The SE and XSE are the sportier versions with special rocker panels, 19-inch machined-finish alloy wheels (standard on XSE), a subtle rear spoiler lip, more aggressive front bumper, and a rear bumper with a lower diffuser.
Interior Treatments
Likewise the interior has been tarted up here and there, but the main improvements are to the displays, infotainment, creature comforts and the like. And yet again, when you look at what you get in this arena, the Camry comes in as a great value. The passengers, and most importantly, the driver, receive information through three displays: a 10-inch color Heads-Up Display (HUD); a seven-inch multi-information display within the instrument cluster itself, and an eight-inch audio/navigation/HVAC control panel integrated into the center console.
Toyota says it’s all intuitive in how it operates, and I assume they’re right, because they better be right. Steve Jobs made intuitive operation a by-word of modern day living, and people are used to it now, so Toyota better deliver.
Related: Camry and Avalon get the TRD treatment for 2020.
Further Emphasis On Technology
The new Camry gets the latest Entune 3.0 multimedia system, with Apple CarPlay compatibility and Amazon Alexa. Four-cylinder and hybrid models come with Entune 3.0 Audio, Toyota’s App Suite, and Scout GPS Link. The audio end includes an optional JBL system (nine speakers plus a 10.1-inch subwoofer) complete with Clari-Fi. Toyota describes Clari-Fi as something that “un-compresses” music to help restore an audio track’s dynamic range.

Speaking of dynamic, Camry V6 models offer a Dynamic Navigation system with wireless map updates and over-the-air map downloads for recently added roads and points-of-interest.
There is also Remote Connect, which gets you a remote start and door unlock capability, vehicle status notifications, a guest driver monitor (I bet this is for you nervous parents out there), and a vehicle finder. Service Connect provides up-to-date information on fuel levels, maintenance alerts and that sort of thing. Wi-Fi? Why yes, there’s Wi-Fi Connect powered by Verizon, so you can hook up five mobile devices.
Safety & Security
Would you expect the latest Camry to look the other way on safety measures? No, you wouldn’t, and here we are treated to a buffet of safety goodness. There’s the Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, and Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist. There’s a Blind Spot Monitor, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Intelligent Clearance Sonar, and a Rear Cross Traffic Braking system.
Other safety measures include 10 standard airbags, Toyota’s Star Safety System with Enhanced Vehicle Stability Control, Traction Control, Electronic Brake-Force Distribution, Brake Assist, Anti-lock Braking System, and Smart Stop Technology. There’s even a standard backup camera.
Powertrain & Transmission Options
There are three powertrain choices for the 2019 Toyota Camry, including a hybrid option.
The “normal” engines are hooked up to a Direct Shift eight-speed automatic. The ratios are new as is the torque converter with a wider range of lock-up for improved fuel efficiency. For the Hybrids, Toyota says their Sequential Shiftmatic technology allows the driver to “shift” the electronically-controlled, continuously variable transmission via paddle shifters (SE grade) or with the console-mounted shift lever.
Really, I can’t say which powertrain is better. They all work, and they will all work well for daily driving. It’s up to you which one you pick. However, let’s take a quick look at each of them a little further so you can decide.
Gasoline Engines
The 2.5-liter, inline-four-cylinder (D-4S) gasoline engine, is a solid and reliable choice. Peak horsepower is estimated at 206 at 6,600 rpm (176 horsepower at 5,700 rpm in the hybrid configuration) with torque estimated at 186 lb-ft. at 5,000 rpm (163 lb-ft. at 3,600-5,200 rpm for the hybrid). Fuel economy for 2.5-liter gas models is an EPA-estimated 29/41 city/highway and 34 combined mpg.
The 3.5-liter V6, with D-4S Fuel Injection, is the more powerful choice with an enhanced variable valve timing system to provide optimum torque at all engine speeds. The V6 delivers 301 horsepower at 6,600 rpm, 267 lb-ft. of torque at 4,700 rpm, and an EPA-estimated 22/33 city/highway and 26 combined mpg. This marks an increase of eight percent for combined mpg versus the Camry’s previous V6.

Hybrid Drive
The 2019 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes in at 51/53 city/highway and 52 combined mpg on the LE grade. By comparison, the SE and XLE grades come it at 44/47 city/highway and 46 combined mpg. Toyota says the updated and more compact Power Control Unit (PCU) of the hybrid system plays a key role in improving efficiency. Improvements in the conversion efficiency of the PCU and the transaxle/electric motor reduce energy loss by nearly 20 percent.
Furthermore, Toyota says cooling system improvements now reduce energy loss by 10 percent.

2019/03/12,Lagonda All-Terrain Concept: The EV With The Floating Key,"Aston Martin Lagonda aims to be the world’s first zero-emission luxury brand.
The company will leverage electrification and autonomous driving technologies.
The Lagonda All-Terrain Concept is set for production in 2022 and includes a floating key.
It’s called the Lagonda All-Terrain Concept, and its name is the most uncreative thing about it. Basically, it’s an uber-luxo SUV crossover thingo from Lagonda (i.e. Aston Martin), powered by equal parts electricity and style, and the owners smug sense of entitlement. Aston Martin Lagonda says they’re serious, and they’re really going to make it at a new facility in St Athan, Wales.
Lagonda says it will enter production in 2022, but that sounds rather ambitious. I’ll believe it when I see one on the road. Then again, I said that about Bentley making an SUV, and then I actually did see one, in rural Arizona, of all places, so what do I know?
Near-Future Study & Forces of Gravity
Lagonda calls the All-Terrain Concept “The Future of The Luxury SUV,” and in a certain way, they’re right. By going the EV route, Lagonda is betting that future, rich SUV buyers are going to pay a premium for luxury EVs. If you take the mode of motivation out of the equation, the All-Terrain Concept does give that market segment what they’re looking for.
The Lagonda All-Terrain Concept is, as Lagonda puts it, a “near-future” study. That means it’s just a bunch of renderings, drawings, and ideas lashed together around this “vision” of what rich people in the near future will want. Then again, that motivation could come in the form of growing regulations, coupled with the growing sense of environmental doom wrought at the hands of engine emissions. In fact, a growing number of people believe EVs are the way of the future.
They are totally over the top when trying to explain the styling, saying it drew inspiration from the likes of the Concorde SST and the world of super yachts. Lagonda uses terminology like “relaxed elegance” and “rear-leaning gesture of the belt line” and “forms and shapes that look like they have been created by the huge, planetary forces of gravity fields,” without a hint of irony.

Styling & Design: Red Carpet Treatment
I’m not saying the thing looks ugly, far from it. It’s rather pleasing overall, but just try to imagine the Lagonda All-Terrain Concept splattered with mud, carrying a couple of bales of hay and spools of barbed wire. Funny, no? Then again, you’ll never see a Bentley Bentayga or a Rolls Cullinan doing that either, so I guess the guys in marketing shouldn’t worry.

2020 Hyundai Venue: Practical & Efficient; Did Hyundai Hit a Homer?
Auto designers are starting to clock to the fact that EVs really do free up a lot of design possibilities. The Lagonda All-Terrain Concept is no different. Its batteries are located in the stiffened floor, lowering the center of gravity and opening up a lot of interior space. The interior space is further amplified by the rear-hinged back doors that not only give you a “spectacular ‘red carpet’ moment as the interior and its occupants are revealed” (no seriously, they said that), but also that cool factor that suicide doors always have.
The “tailgate” of the All-Terrain is a wide clamshell rear hatch affair which might work, practically; but if nothing else, it does look spectacular. That’s also aided by the slick light strip that hides the LEDs and only lets you see the beam.
The rear shelf/loading area slides out from the floor, which is nice, and functions sort of like a slide-out shelf in your kitchen. When not in use, it’s hidden flush with the body and stowed. When not used for loading and unloading, you can sit on it and watch the polo match; or bet on which of your servants will survive this fortnight’s battle to the death. There’s also lots of glass so the All-Terrain’s occupants can “survey the landscape.”

Floating Keys
The interior has a limousine atmosphere with a lack of visible vents and speakers. There’s tons of space, and although no dimensions were given, this thing looks to be the size of a tank. Which makes the available seating (four) seem like some sort of joke. The biggest, flashiest show piece is, of all things, the key. The Lagonda All-Terrain does have one, but you don’t slide it into a lock, oh no; when placed in position, the key floats, levitating between the front seats, thanks to the wonder of electromagnets. Sheesh.
And if you take the mode of motivation into the equation, then the All-Terrain Concept gives rich people the sheen of being eco-conscious and green and all that sort of thing. In a lot of ways, the All-Terrain Concept is the green icing on the cake.
Production & Manufacturing
The aforementioned St Athan facility, once a Ministry of Defence Super Hangar, is undergoing renovations. St Athan will be Aston Martin Lagonda’s second facility and will become their electrification hub.
The St Athan site will commence with Aston Martin DBX production, with the Lagonda All-Terrain Concept following in 2022. Over 70 Welsh employees have now joined the already 100-strong St Athan team. Those employees spent the last two-and-a-half years at Aston Martin Lagonda’s Gaydon Headquarters.

2019/03/09,"2020 Jaguar XE: Proper, Precise & Sporty In All Ways British","The 2020 Jaguar XE debuts with two engines; one comes standard with all-wheel drive. 
18-inch wheels, electric leather seats, LED headlights, and signature graphics are also standard.
Jag is still at it with their XE sports sedan. Aimed squarely at those who might want a BMW or an Audi, the refreshed 2020 Jaguar XE aims to hit all the right spots. And, more or less, they do. The real question here is will anyone actually buy a Jaguar over something German? And look, I can’t really answer that question. That’s up to you to decide, but Lord knows Jag has been trying very hard to get you to decide in their favor for a long while.
For 2020, the cats from Coventry updated their XE sedan in four areas: exterior, interior, and performance, along with ubiquitous tech goodies.
Styling & Design: A Sporty Character
Jaguar says the 2020 XE is even more striking, but that’s obviously in the eye of the beholder. However, it’s hard not to agree with them as far as it being sharper and having a more assertive stance. The front receives a different bumper and a wider grille for a more planted appearance. The rear bumper and rear valance, also new, increase the visual width and aim to highlight the car’s sporting character. The R-Dynamic S model, that would be the factory performance option (the one we’d buy), has “aircraft winglet-inspired” lower front apertures.
Do they do anything besides look cool? Probably not.
Hold The Brandy
The interior is just what you’d expect from Jaguar; no, it’s just what you’d expect from a British car company: it is Proper. Sure, the Brits might be stuffed and hide-bound with things like this, but they sure know how to make everything seem like an Edwardian drawing room; even if it happens to be an automobile driving down the road.
In the case of the 2020 Jaguar XE, the interior is all-new and beautifully-appointed. There is heightened attention to detail, with premium materials and finishes throughout the cabin. There’s a new, optional InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system and 12.3-inch interactive driver display. It allows for further customization, with Jaguar saying it’s both intuitive and responsive. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come standard.
The high-tech stuff everyone has come to expect these days includes an optional ClearSight Rear View Mirror with a high-definition display screen for better rearward visibility. “Smart Settings” technology uses artificial intelligence to learn your preferences and adjusts the seats, mirrors, audio, and climate automatically, because touching one button is just too hard nowadays.

[bctt tweet=”You’ll feel like you’re sitting in a leather armchair with a brandy at the gentleman’s club. Minus the brandy, my good man!” username=”Automoblog”]
Power & Performance: Engine Mapping & Toggle Switches
Now, about what’s under the hood of the 2020 Jaguar XE. Customers get to choose between two Ingenium turbocharged four-cylinder engines, the P250 or P300. Roughly speaking, that’s the power output. More precisely, we’re talking either 247 or 296 horsepower. Revised software programming, new engine mapping, and updated hardware components give the P300 an advantage versus the P250. The P300 models benefit from better throttle response and acceleration, thanks to 295 lb-ft. of torque. The P300 is standard with all-wheel drive and hits 60 mph in 5.4 seconds.
The P250 models come in either rear or all-wheel drive, and even though the P300 is the sportier option, methinks a lighter, rear-wheel drive car might be more fun. It will have more traditional views with regard to handling, feel, and balance. In terms of handling, the 2020 Jaguar XE employs a double wishbone front suspension and an Integral Link rear suspension. 75 percent of the XE’s body structure is aluminum.
Gearing is handled by an eight-speed automatic that allows for manual shifts. Picking your cog is accomplished via the SportShift selector and JaguarDrive Control “toggle switch” inspired by, if not lifted whole, from the F-TYPE. Be gone rotary control gear selector of Jag sedans past!

Pricing & Availability
How much? Not all that bad. Prices start at $39,900 for the S P250 with rear-wheel drive; tack on another $2,000 for all-wheel drive. The R-Dynamic S P300 with all-wheel drive starts at $46,295. In other words, right in BMW 3 Series territory. The 2020 Jaguar XE is available for order now.

2019/03/08,"Mercedes-AMG GLE 53: Looks Sharp, Smells Fresh","The Mercedes-Benz GLE receives a special treatment courtesy of Affalterbach.
An AMG-tuned six-cylinder produces over 400 horsepower and 380 lb-ft. of torque.
Interior highlights include red accent stitching and a special fragrance named “AMG#63.” 
Did you know there are still straight six engines out there? There are, and not only that, but there’s an in-line six that AMG has monkeyed with. And the Germans saw fit to drop it into their new SUV, the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53. Yes, it works, but also yes, it features some rather interesting technology.
The GLE is just what the modern and well-off SUV buyer wants these days: big, roomy, safe, giving the appearance of off-road capability and, probably most importantly, brand recognition. That three-pointed star on the grille tells every other soccer mom and drama king who’s who in the parking lot.
And who is that? You! That’s right. But you still gotta check out this engine.
Tricks of The Trade
It’s a 3.0-liter, six-cylinder in-line plant, cranking out 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft. of torque. On top of that, a trick starter/generator, part of the EQ Boost system, briefly provides an additional 21 horsepower, plus 184 lb-ft. of torque. It also feeds the 48-volt on-board electrical system. Apart from that trick alternator, it’s all pretty standard, right? Oh no, check this: The GLE’s engine is both turbo and supercharged, and even the supercharger itself is weird. The blower is an electrically-powered affair – not the traditional belt-driven, off-the-engine arrangement – and its there more as an auxiliary compressor to build up boost pressure without delays until the turbocharger kicks in. Clever.
Quicker engine response and less turbo lag is the idea. Yes, it’s complex. And yes, I would bet that when something fails, it will be an absolute bear to fix. It will also put a big dent in your bank account, but let’s not worry about that now. Let’s just worry about this: zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds!
Related: An in-depth look at the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE.
Transmission & Drivetrain Tech
Now, the even the more “mundane” stuff, in comparison to the engine’s forced induction trickery, is still pretty interesting. Gear selection is handled by an AMG-spec nine-speed automatic transmission. Even though it’s a slush box, Merc says the transmission is very responsive, and can be controlled by the steering wheel shift paddles so you can feel like Lewis Hamilton. From there, all that Germanic power hits the road (or gravel or mud or whatever) through an AMG Performance 4MATIC+ fully variable all-wheel drive system.

The rear axle is permanently driven, while the front axle continually calculates for optimum torque. Power is distributed from there accordingly.
Steering & Suspension
As you’d expect, the suspension isn’t “normal” either. The Airmatic AMG Active Ride Control handles body movement and reduces rolling movements when cornering. The Airmatic setup includes adaptive adjustable damping (ADS+) and has three pre-selected modes: Comfort, Sport, and Sport+. The Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 maintains a constant ride height regardless of the vehicle load. However, in Sport and Sport+, the GLE 53 is lowered by 15 millimeters to reduce aero drag and fuel consumption. The handling and stability improves thanks to a lower center of gravity.
If the going gets bad, ground clearance can be upped by 55 mm at the touch of a button.
The steering is an electro-mechanical, speed-sensitive power rack and pinion design with two stages, Comfort or Sport. Braking is handled by 400 x 36 mm, internally-ventilated and perforated disks at the front, and internally-ventilated 345 x 25 mm disks at the rear.
Interior Treatments: Smell The Roses
The Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 features black Artico and Dinamica seats with red contrast top-stitching and AMG markings. The top part of the instrument panel is also covered in Artico. Around the cabin, it’s a combination of brushed aluminum with additional red contrast stitching. An optional, folding third row seat turns the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 into a seven-seater.
And get this: there is an exclusive interior fragrance called “AMG#63” as part of the Air-Balance package. According to Mercedes-AMG, it is an inspiring, sporty scent to match the spirit of the performance brand. So jump in and take a whiff.
Pricing & Availability
The Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 will arrive in dealer showrooms by late 2020 with pricing to be announced at a later date.

2019/03/06,BMW Group & Daimler AG Partner For Autonomous Driving Technology,"The partnership will focus on next-generation autonomous technology. 
BMW and Daimler say they may partner with other companies along the way.
The BMW Group and Daimler AG are partnering for a number of autonomous driving initiatives. The companies say they are looking to advance the development of next-generation driver assistance systems and autonomous driving, including up to SAE Level 4. Both have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly develop this and other new technologies related to future mobility.
“The BMW Group and Daimler AG view their partnership as a long-term, strategic cooperation and aim to make next-level technologies widely available by the middle of the coming decade,” a statement from both companies reads.
Faster Development Times
BMW Group and Daimler AG are looking to streamline the development of autonomous technology. The collaboration should, according to the two companies, shorten product development cycles and allow for more timely market launches.
“As we continue to pursue our strategy, we are combining the expertise of two technology leaders. At the BMW Group, long-term partnerships within a flexible, scalable, non-exclusive platform are fundamental to advancing the industrialization of autonomous driving,” explained Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development. “Combining the key expertise of our two companies will boost our innovative strength and speed up the spread of this technology.”
Related: Do people still have a desire to drive? Here is what one survey says.
BMW & Daimler: Autonomous Driving Initiatives
The BMW Group has been establishing non-exclusive platforms with technology specialists, suppliers, and OEMs since 2006. BMW’s Autonomous Driving Campus in Unterschleissheim, just north of Munich, serves as a research and development hub. The technology currently under development will enter series production as Level 3 automation in 2021 in the BMW iNEXT. However, it will also be Level 4-ready for pilot programs.
“The iNEXT project will provide our building blocks for the future, from which the entire company and all of its brands are set to benefit,” said Harald Krüger, Chairman of the Board of Management at the BMW Group, during the BMW AG Annual General Meeting last May. “It underlines the leading role Germany plays in the future of mobility.”
In a similar fashion, Daimler AG is working on autonomous driving projects to accommodate Levels 3, 4, and 5. Early next decade, Daimler AG says they will apply higher levels of automation across a wide variety of segments, including passenger cars, vans, trucks, and buses.
“Autonomous driving is one of the most revolutionary trends for us at the moment, and the entire Daimler Group is working very hard on it,” said Ola Källenius, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. “As always at Daimler, our top priority is safety. Instead of individual, stand-alone solutions, we want to develop a reliable overall system that offers noticeable added-value for customers.”

2019/03/05,"Hyundai Elantra GT N Line: Sporty Looks, Tight Handling & Low Cost","2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N Line boasts sportier looks and performance upgrades.
The turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine is retained for the Elantra GT N Line.
Prices start at $23,300 for the manual and $24,400 for the DCT seven speed automatic.
Things are shaking up at Hyundai. After successfully dethroning the competition as the best-driving small luxury sedan with the Genesis G70, the South Korean car maker is sending us the 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N Line.
My primary aim is to put an end to the confusion, so bear with me. The N Line is a new trim level for the Elantra, which replaces the Elantra GT Sport. However, the entry-level Elantra GT is still available. In fact, the Style Package for the Elantra GT now includes full leather upholstery and a panoramic sunroof. I don’t know about you, but that’s a smashing deal at $23,000.
So if the Honda Civic Si, Ford Fiesta ST, and Volkswagen Golf GTI are not to your liking, then feast your eyes on the 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N Line.
Significant Upgrades Inside & Out
It’s hard to see the changes upon first glance. In fact, you might mistake the new Elantra GT N Line as a simple cosmetic makeover from the previous Elantra GT Sport. But look closer and you’ll see a sculpted front bumper with larger air intakes, a more aggressive mesh front grille, a new lower front spoiler, blacked-out side mirrors, and new N Line-specific 18-inch alloy wheels.
Out back, the new Elantra GT N Line gets dual exhaust, a rear diffuser, and N Line badging (well of course!). The interior is not spared from the N Line treatment, either. Those black leather seats with red stitching are a sight for sore eyes. The new leather steering wheel and gauge clusters all add to the premium feel inside the cabin.
Related: Does it bite or just bark? An in-depth look at the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N.
Style & Substance: More Than Looks
The exterior changes are welcome. But the most exciting bits about the new Hyundai Elantra GT N Line are skin deep. The car gets stiffer springs and engine and transmission mounts. This not only translates to tighter handling and better high-speed stability, but a quieter ride.
The 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N Line receives retuned shock absorbers, new front and rear sway bars, and recalibrated steering. These changes will address the shortcomings of the previous Elantra GT Sport, making the N Line a better counterpart to the Civic and Golf.
Turbocharged Power & Transmission Tech
I’ll say it outright: if you were expecting more horsepower, I’m sorry to burst your bubble. The N Line inherits the same 1.6-liter turbocharged and direct-injected four-banger as the GT Sport. The motor churns out a reasonable 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft. of torque. It’s less horsepower than the VW Golf GTI, but slightly more than the Ford Fiesta ST offers.

But unlike Toyota (who is still figuring out a manual option for the new Supra), Hyundai is kind enough to include a six-speed manual in the new Elantra GT N Line. You can also choose the slick seven-speed dual-clutch automatic with paddle shifters for $1,100 more. My money is on the automatic. I’ll only choose the manual if Hyundai bolts a more powerful motor to the chassis. Somewhere around 230 or 250 horsepower will do.
And why wouldn’t you choose the automatic? Hyundai claims a 6.3-second sprint to 60 mph with the DCT. The manual is good for 6.6 seconds with near-perfect shifts. It’s not much, but the automatic is faster and makes the most out of the available horsepower.
Related: The Hyundai Elantra receives a complete redesign for 2019.
Impressive Standard Equipment
The 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N Line also comes with an impressive level of kit. This includes ventilated seats, wireless charging, power-operated driver’s seat, panoramic sunroof, and an eight-inch AVN 5.0 navigation system. Also standard is an Infinity premium audio system with seven speakers and a subwoofer.
Hyundai’s Smart Sense is standard and includes adaptive cruise control with start/stop capabilities, driver attention warnings, lane keeping assist, high beam assist, and forward collision avoidance assist.
Pricing & Availability
But the best part? The 2019 Hyundai Elantra GT N Line with the manual will start at only $23,300, while the automatic is $24,400. The manual, in particular, is only $50 more than the outgoing GT Sport. Destination and freight charges will run you an additional $885. The Elantra GT N Line is available now.

2019/03/04,Tesla Finally Enters “Affordable EV” Arena With Base Model 3,"The base Tesla Model 3 starts at $35,000 and has a range of over 200 miles.
Tesla is looking to challenge Nissan, Kia, and Hyundai – each have “affordable EV” options. 
The base Model 3 follows difficult news for employees as the automaker shutters its retail locations.
In what seemed like an eternity, Elon Musk is finally making good on his promise of an affordable version of the Tesla Model 3. Folks, you can now order your very own $35,000 Tesla Model 3 online.
Very few business leaders are like Elon Musk. It’s not about making promises, but it’s the execution that counts. After an onslaught of affordable electric vehicles like the new Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Kona EV, and Kia Niro EV, there was a moment when people thought Tesla was resting on their laurels.
And just when we thought Tesla was merely surfing the wave of success brought about by the Model S, Model X, and premium versions of the Model 3, along comes the base model – the realization of a promise. The base Model 3 costs $35,000 before tax credits. That’s approximately $26,950 when all is said and done.
What Do I Get In A $35k Tesla Model 3?
This is where the good news comes in. Unlike conventional cars, you still get plenty of ‘oomph and features in the base Tesla Model 3. It has an EPA-estimated range of 220 miles or 354 kilometers. The car is powered by a single electric motor driving the rear wheels, and can scoot to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, which is quick for an “affordable” electric car.
Tesla didn’t skimp on the interior, either. The base Tesla Model 3 comes with manual seat and steering adjustments, cloth seats, a basic audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, standard maps and navigation, a center console dock for two smartphones, and four USB ports. You still get the standard, 15-inch touchscreen display in the $35,000 Tesla Model 3. You also get that gorgeous tinted glass roof, along with auto-dimming, power-folding (and heated) side mirrors. The base car comes with 18-inch aero wheels standard. If you want sportier 19-inch wheels, Tesla will oblige for an additional $1,500.
The base Tesla Model 3 is available in five colors. However, there’s a catch. Black is a no-cost option while midnight silver metallic and deep blue metallic will cost $1,500. The pearl white multi-coat option goes for an additional $2,000 while the flamboyant red multi-coat paint is yours for $2,500.
If you’re skimping on cash, we hope you like black cars.

Autopilot & Self-Driving Capabilities? Check!
The base Tesla Model 3 can be ordered with Autopilot for an additional $3,000. This enables your Model 3 to steer, accelerate, and brake automatically when it detects pedestrians and other vehicles in the lane.
But for full self-driving capabilities, you’ll need to fork out another $5,000. This allows your Tesla Model 3 to cruise on Autopilot, overtake slower cars, navigate over interchanges, and automatically park in parallel and perpendicular spaces. You can even summon the car to come to you anywhere in the parking lot. This is James Bond stuff we’re talking about here!
But if you prefer to stick to the $35,000 budget for a new Tesla Model 3, it’s good to know the base car comes standard with emergency braking, collision warning, and blind spot monitoring.
No Test Drives Allowed
No, really. However, you can return the car within seven days or 1,000 miles (whichever comes first) if you’re not satisfied. Yes, this means you can take it on a short road trip and return it if you don’t like it. It’s as simple as that. Try doing that at a conventional dealership.
And if you think Musk is tripping on herb when he envisioned this strategy, there’s a pretty good reason for this. Tesla is planning to close most of their retail outlets, meaning fewer Tesla cars are available for a test drive. This also means Tesla vehicles can only be ordered online via the official Tesla website.
This is an otherwise sour note to what seems to be an exciting time in the automotive industry. Unfortunately for Tesla retail employees, job cuts are inevitable in the near future. This is the harsh truth behind the realization of an affordable, mass-market, and long-range Tesla Model 3.

Model S & Model X Price Cuts
Along with the arrival of the $35,000 Tesla Model 3, the company also cut the base prices for the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. The standard Model S starts at $79,000. It has a range of 270 miles, a top speed of 140 mph, and can hit 60 in 4.2 seconds. In fact, the long-range version of the Tesla Model S is now $10,000 less than last year’s version. It starts at $83,000 with 335 miles of range and a top speed of 155 mph.
Significant price cuts are also in effect for the Model S Performance and Ludicrous trims.

On the other hand, the base Tesla Model X is now the long-range version with 295 miles of range, zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds, and a top speed of 155. This model starts at $88,000 but is $8,000 less than previous ones. Surprisingly enough, you get a savings of up to $17,000 if you choose the Model X Performance and Performance Ludicrous trims.

2019/03/02,2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC: All Good Things Come To An End,"After its launch in 1996, the SLK marked the start of a new era for the traditional Mercedes-Benz brand.
Next year, fans of the roadster are getting one last run with the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC Final Edition.
“Mercedes-Benz SLK: 1996 – 2020.” That’s what it’ll read on the little guy’s tombstone. In the roadster/sports car segment, that’s a pretty good run. All good things must come to an end. And so it is with the 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC (aka the SLK) which just showed its last hand with the SLC 300 Final Edition. Although not as “true” to sports cars as a Miata (which they came out as a Germanic answer to), the SLKs were okay, especially the AMG versions.
Mercedes, being a bit more emotional than one would expect, have decided to give their little two-seater a fond farewell.
2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC 300 Final Edition: Styling & Design
Perhaps the feature the SLK can most justifiably be praised for was the power-folding hardtop. As a comfortable driver in the sunny Pacific Northwest, many is the time that I wished I could have a hardtop appear over my head quickly and at the push of a button. That said, what does the outgoing 2020 SLC Final Edition bring to the showroom? Good stuff!
It’s worth noting, however, this special model is based on the AMG Line. That’s the AMG Line, not AMG, the performance tuners. This is more of a look-fast versus a go-fast deal. The SLC 300 Final Edition boasts a distinctive look with an AMG-style front bumper with silver chrome trim. The door handles, mirrors, and rear brace come in a high-gloss black finish. “SLC Final Edition” badges adorn the front fenders just below the chromed fin. Five-spoke, AMG light-alloy, 18-inch wheels with a high-gloss black finish come standard.
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC comes with a lower (10 mm) sport suspension and a larger braking system with perforated discs. Okay, those last two are actually go-fast bits. Yay!
Interior Treatments
The interior of the SLC 300 is dressed in two-tone Nappa leather (Black/Silver Pearl) with grey top-stitching. Carbon-fiber-look leather inserts in the head restraints and the upper section of the seatbacks finish the interior. There’s also silver “SLC” lettering on the head restraints and the “gear” selector (it’s an automatic transmission). The steering wheel has carbon leather in the upper and lower segment, with a smoother Nappa leather in the grip area, the opposite of what I would have done.
Other standard goodies in the SLC 300 Final Edition include black floor mats with an embroidered logo, that slick AIRSCARF neck-level heating (which is a really good thing to have), and heated seats (another good thing). There’s also a memory package for the seats, steering column, and exterior mirrors, a nice touch.

Mercedes-AMG SLC43 Final Edition: Styling & Design
But wait . . . there’s more! Say hello to the Mercedes-AMG SLC43 Final Edition! What, did you think there wasn’t going to be a full-on AMG option? Ha-ha I say, ha-ha! The Final Edition of the AMG SLC43 pumps up the racy appearance with Sun Yellow paint and a bunch of high-gloss black elements. The wheels are matte black, five-spoke, AMG light-alloy 18-inchers with a yellow rim flange.
The inside of the AMG SLC43 is also a two-tone leather affair with grey top-stitching and seatbelts. There’s that carbon-fiber-look leather here and there as well. The steering wheel is an AMG Performance unit with carbon-embossed leather in the upper and lower segment, as well as Nappa leather in the grip area. There’s a crystal grey, 12-o’clock marker and an additional “AMG EDITION” badge.
And yes, you get the AIRSCARF neck-level heating and the memory package.
Power & Performance
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC comes with an in-line four that creates 241 horsepower and 273 lb-ft. of torque. By comparison, the Mercedes-AMG SLC43 Final Edition comes with a V6 that produces 385 horsepower and 384 lb-ft. of torque. The top speed for both is an electronically-limited 155 mph, although the AMG model hits 60 in 4.6 seconds.
Pricing & Availability
No word yet on price, but they will be in dealer showrooms next year.

2019/03/01,Did The Polestar 2 Just Challenge The Tesla Model 3?,"Polestar will reveal their next model at the Geneva International Motor Show.
The Polestar 2 will compete with other high performance EVs, including the Tesla Model 3. 
BOOM! That sound you heard was a huge warning shot right across the bow of Elon Musk’s yacht. To quote directly from Polestar: “Polestar 2 is the first electric car to compete in the marketplace around the Tesla Model 3, with the range starting at a guide price of 39,900 euros.”
You best get your ducks in a row Elon. First Audi poses a challenge, now the latest from Polestar.
Bringing Out The Big Guns
To get you up to speed, Polestar is Volvo’s performance arm, sort of like the Scandy version of BMW’s M division or Merc’s AMG. Polestar is also, much like Porsche’s upcoming Taycan, getting into electric vehicles in a big way. And this is a good thing, unless your name is Elon Musk. Teslas are, for all intents and purposes, good cars, but they have also had it kind of easy. Who has been competing against them? The Nissan Leaf? The Chevy Bolt? Please.
Now the big guns like Porsche and Audi, and in our case here, Polestar, are taking them on and doing it in no half measure.
The Polestar 2 is an all-electric fastback that hopes to bring electric performance cars to a broader audience. And, with a list price around $45,500, that puts it right in Tesla Model 3 territory. Even more importantly, that figure won’t break the bank for the average performance car buyer.
Related: Polestar: The 600 Horsepower Netflix.
Battery Packs & Performance Tech
The Polestar 2 is powered by two electric motors and “fueled” by a 78 kWh battery. The range should be 500 kilometres, or right around 300 miles or so. Did I mention performance? I should, because the Polestar 2 is quick. Zero to 60 in less than five seconds, thanks to all-wheel drive, 408 horsepower, and 487 lb-ft. of torque. That time becomes even more impressive when you consider the inherent weight penalty of the battery pack.
The 27-module battery pack and drivetrain are built around Volvo’s Compact Modular Architecture platform, a bright move from a manufacturing standpoint. The battery pack lives in the floor and contributes to the rigidity of the chassis. This will improve the car’s noise, vibration, and harshness levels while lowering the center of gravity; always a good thing.
Chassis dynamics are regulated via Öhlins dampers, Brembo brakes, and 20-inch forged wheels. The seat belts, brake calipers, and valve caps are gold, which they say is a “signature” that completes the performance visuals. No, I don’t exactly get that one either.

Polestar Precept: Science Fiction or Something More?
Polestar says they have the “important question of charging” figured out via an extensive approach. The Polestar 2 uses in-car and mobile devices to help drivers find public charging networks. Think of it as Google Maps optimized to find any and every charging station on the planet.
And Speaking of Google . . .
Polestar 2 is one of the first cars to embed an infotainment system powered by Google’s Android OS. This Android backbone provides a robust and flexible digital environment for apps and vehicle functions to coexist. It also brings embedded Google services to a car for the first time. These include Google Assistant, Google Maps (with support for electric vehicles), and the Google Play Store. You can tell your Polestar what to do with either voice control, or an 11-inch touchscreen display.
Also, it’s pretty implicit here that “Phone-as-Key” technology will be an option as well. The Polestar 2 will sense the driver upon approach and turn itself on, activating features in a customized way. Neat!
The Polestar 2 also has some slick design elements here and there, such as Pixel LED headlights and proximity lighting with a unique welcome sequence. There are frameless side mirrors and an illuminated Polestar logo that reflects onto the car’s panoramic glass roof.
Pricing & Availability
As with all other Polestars, the 2 can only be ordered online. It’s like Amazon. You choose and configure your Polestar 2 via a website, plunk down your 40-thou via bank transfer, and then they’ll deliver it to you. Or you visit a nearby Polestar Space, staffed by non-commissioned representatives. Either way, production of the Polestar 2 begins early next year.
Initial launch markets include China, the United States, Canada, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. MSRP for the launch edition Polestar 2 is $63,000 – less the federal incentive of $7,500.

2019/02/27,2020 GMC Acadia: New Nips & Tucks For This SUV,"The 2020 GMC Acadia receives new styling and propulsion updates. 
A nine-speed transmission replaces the Acadia’s older six speed automatic.
GMC says the connectivity and infotainment systems are more user-friendly.
GMC just rolled out the 2020 Acadia and it’s everything you’d expect. Big, boxy, practical, well thought-out, dripping in tech and, most importantly, right in the middle of every Venn diagram of what marketing wants, engineering can do, and the customer can afford. In other words, get used to the looks of the 2020 GMC Acadia.
Cause you’re going to be seeing a lot of them around.
Styling & Design
The new Acadia sets itself apart from other SUVs and crossovers with that standard-for-GM, big, honkin’ square-square-square face. The 2020 Acadia gets a new grille with black chrome accents, new front and rear fascias, and GMC’s now signature C-shaped lighting. It’s not exactly ugly, but I’ll bet you a beer nobody in Italy is impressed.
The Acadia rides on 17-inch wheels with 18 and 20-inchers available. The outside mirrors have integrated LED turn signals and are power folding. The power liftgate is a hands-free affair with GMC logo projection for a bit of flash. GM has redesigned the center console with more storage space.
Power & Performance
The 2020 GMC Acadia is propelled by a new 2.0L turbo engine, standard on SLT and Denali models. It features GM’s tri-power variable valve lift technology to balance power and efficiency. GMC says cylinder deactivation during light load conditions will further boost the engine’s efficiency. The turbo itself is a dual-scroll design in which GMC promises better low-speed torque delivery. Bottom line: 230 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Not bad for only two liters.
The 2.5L I-4 and the 3.6L V6 engines are also available for the 2020 GMC Acadia, depending on what trim level you choose. For example, the more rugged Acadia AT4 comes with the 3.6L V6, producing 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft. of torque. A twin clutch, all-wheel drive system is standard on the AT4.
A new nine-speed automatic replaces the outgoing six-speed as the standard transmission for all engines. The nine-speed offers better acceleration and efficiency. The new tranny even allows for more storage room in the center console by replacing the conventional shifter with an electronically-controlled gear selector.
Related: No road, no problem. An in-depth look at the 2019 GMC Sierra AT4.
Tech & Connectivity
As you would expect, the latest Acadia is brimming with tech stuff, comfort and convenience features, connectivity options, and other amenities. GMC says the infotainment system is more intelligent and intuitive than before, with better voice recognition, a higher resolution touchscreen, and an easier interface requiring fewer steps with easier screen layouts.

The eight-inch diagonal screen also has enhanced new features like a personal profile that allows you to tailor the infotainment system to your preferences. So stuff like audio, navigation, and climate settings can come up just the way you like it. You can store up to four profiles, automatically resetting the preferences for the incoming driver. Think of it as a bigger version of memory seats.
There are two new USB-C charging ports in the front and rear of the center console, which is a nice touch. This brings the number of ports in the new Acadia to five.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 GMC Acadia is built at GM’s Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plant and will go on sale this fall. Pricing information is forthcoming.

2019/02/26,Bentley Bentayga Speed: Meet The World’s Fastest SUV,"The Bentley Bentayga Speed has a powerful 6.0-liter engine.
Luxury appointments include a unique Alcantara interior trim.
The carbon ceramic braking system is nothing short of impressive. 
The new Bentley Bentayga Speed is now the fastest production SUV in the world. Yes, I know, that’s kind of like setting a record for steam trains or something, but there you are. Just how fast, anyway? The top speed is 190 mph, and it can hit 62 mph in 3.9 seconds. Which is impressive in its own right, and even more so when you realize the new Bentayga Speed weighs (checks notes) . . . huh, Bentley doesn’t say.
We’ll just go with really fat until we hear otherwise.
Down With The Sickness
Okay, let’s get this name out of the way: It’s annoyingly bad. Sure, it’s got a “bent” in there, like Bentley, but the rest of it just seems like it’s made up using the same algorithm pharmaceutical companies use to come up with drug names. It’s either that, or an obscure disease threatening the life of that cute love interest in this season’s third-best romcom. “I’m sorry, but Justin Bieber has a serious case of Bentayga.” Bentley could have named it the Bentley Ben Nevis or something, but no. Bentayga.
Get used to it, cause they’re selling a lot of these things.
And sure, I can see why. It’s as comfy as a leather arm chair in The Hunt Club and those speed figures aren’t anything to sneeze at. The organization from Crewe gets there thanks to a 6.0-liter, W12 engine that delivers 626 horsepower. The Speed moniker tacked on here was lifted from the 2007 Continental GT. So it’s not really that much of a stretch. The Bentayga Speed sets itself apart from the more plebian Bentaygas with dark-tint headlights, body-colored side skirts, and a tailgate spoiler.
There’s also a dark-tint radiator and bumper grilles, unique 22-inch wheels, and Speed signature badging.
Drive Modes & Braking Technology
The Bentley Bentayga Speed is outfitted with four drive modes: Comfort, Bentley, Sport, and Custom. Obviously, custom allows you to create your own driving setup, but I have no idea what on earth “Bentley” would mean as a mode. The rubber at the corners is controlled by the Bentley Dynamic Ride system, the world’s first electric active roll control technology, according to the automaker. Bentley says it can instantly counteract lateral rolling forces while cornering to ensures maximum tire contact.
The exhaust is tweaked to “further enhance the driver experience,” i.e. it sounds sportier. The whole humongous shebang comes to a halt with the largest and most powerful carbon ceramic brakes ever fitted to a Bentley. The braking system clamps on 6,000 Nm of braking toque (4,425 lb-ft. of torque) and can survive temps in excess of 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Oh, and they also save more than 44 lbs. over iron brakes.
Interior Treatments: Swooshes & Speed
Yes, yes dear boy, all that is well and good, but what’s it like on the inside? What do you expect it to be like? It is the “epitome of modern British design,” according to Bentley. Which is what, exactly? I’ll tell you what that is. It’s superior to anything you chaps can come up with, that’s what it is. It is a new color split interior that uses Alcantara trim. And style lines highlighted by elegant “swooshes.” It is contrast stitching and diamond quilting on the cushion bolsters, backrest, and door pads. It is the word “Speed” embroidered at the top of the seats in either blind or contrast stitching.
Available options include 22-way adjustable front seats with massage function, carbon fiber fascia panels, a rear-seat entertainment system, and mood lighting. Finally, a Speed badge adorns the passenger side fascia, with an illuminated tread plate to welcome passengers into the luxurious cabin.
Pricing & Availability
Any other questions? No, no I thought not. Other than how much and when? You’re from the colonies, aren’t you? The answer to the first one is “very much.” Since this is a Bentley, it’ll likely run you the down payment on a Manhattan condo. So figure that into your budget. As to when, the Bentley Bentayga Speed will debut at the Geneva Motor Show at the beginning of March and go on sale later this year.

2019/02/26,Are You Affected By The BMW Comfort Class Settlement? Know The Facts,"The BMW Comfort Class Settlement seeks to permit Class Representatives to obtain reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs incurred due to spontaneous or unintended locking of the Comfort Access System. 
In a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, plaintiff Kieva Myers), sue on behalf of all people who have similar claims and have suffered similar damages.
In August of 2015, Kieva Meyers purchased a pre-owned 2013 BMW X5 in San Francisco. Like many, she needed reliable transportation for her job and family. The 2013 X5 Meyers purchased was equipped with BMW’s Comfort Access System, a convenience feature that uses sensors to detect where the owner is in proximity to the vehicle. The system allows the driver to access the vehicle virtually hands-free within about a five-foot radius.
For example, once a driver walks up to the vehicle and puts their hand on the door, it will unlock automatically.
However, this convenience feature caused a scare for Meyers just two months later in October of 2015. This incident has become the catalyst for the Comfort Class settlement, a class action lawsuit filed against BMW for an alleged manufacturing defect in the Comfort Access System. All BMW X5 models from 2007 until 2013 are affected.

The views and opinions expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Automoblog. For more information, please review our advertising guidelines.
What Is The Comfort Class Settlement
The settlement states that the Comfort Access System is defective because the doors can be locked from the outside even with the key fob still inside the vehicle. If small children, the elderly, or animals are left inside unintentionally with the key fob, they may become locked inside the vehicle. This can pose hazards that force the owner to take action, including but not limited to breaking into the vehicle and calling emergency personnel. This will likely result in out of pocket costs for the driver.
On October 19th 2015, Meyers opened the rear door of her X5 and placed her child inside. Unbeknownst to her, the remote key fob was still inside the vehicle as she shut the rear door. When Meyers went to open the driver’s side door, it was locked. Because her child was still inside, she was forced to break a window to open her X5.
Recent data shows that children are at risk of death from vehicular heatstroke or hypothermia if they are locked inside.

Meyers Contacted BMW
According to the Comfort Class settlement, the Comfort Access System should prevent the vehicle from being locked. However, Meyers alleges that a defect allows the vehicle to lock even when the key is still inside. This can trap young children and others who are unable to unlock the doors by themselves.
After this incident, Meyers filed a complaint with BMW. A representative of the company responded in an e-mail saying, “we must be dealing either with a malfunction of the locking system or an inadvertent activation of the locking system via either the remote transmitter or the Comfort Access System. Again, it is not impossible to lock a key in the vehicle — and to do so is not necessarily indicative of a malfunction. For example, if a door other than the driver’s door is open and the locking button on the transmitter is pressed, the vehicle will lock when the open door is closed. If the user is unaware of having pressed the locking button, then it would certainly appear that it had somehow locked itself.”
Meyers alleges that BMW knew of the problem in 2007 because an internal training document entitled “Comfort Access vs-42 je 66 04 04 (093).” The Comfort Class settlement pleads that, despite BMW’s knowledge and awareness of the defect, it failed to make repairs to resolve the issue, failed to modify owners’ manuals accordingly, and failed to pay for damages suffered by consumers as a result of the malfunction.
Statement From Legal Counsel
“When manufacturers get notified about major issues involving serious injury or in some cases death, it is the duty of the manufacturer to right the wrong they have committed and to make sure it is not repeated,” reads a statement from the Law Offices of Stephen M. Harris, P.C. and Robert L. Starr, APC in Woodland Hills and Calabasas, California respectively.
Harris and Starr are representing the plaintiffs in the Comfort Class settlement. The settlement guarantees that Class Members who have documented out-of-pocket expenses will be able to receive compensation from BMW.
“BMW was told multiple times about the Comfort Access System malfunction and denied the claim until the argument was too insurmountable to avoid,” the statement further reads.
More Information
If you own a BMW X5 in question, model years 2007 through 2013, you can find out more information about how to file a claim on the Comfort Class Settlement homepage. “Class Vehicles” include any BMW NA E70 vehicle made for sale and/or lease in the U.S. market, with a production date between October 1st, 2006 through June 30th, 2013, equipped with the optional Comfort Access System. The vehicles were sold or leased to Class Members in the United States or Puerto Rico.",https://www.automoblog.net/2019/02/26/bmw-comfort-class-settlement/
2019/02/20,"2020 Subaru Legacy: New Platform, New Tech, New Everything","The 2020 Subaru Legacy ushers in the sedan’s seventh generation.
A new Touring trim will feature genuine Nappa leather, a first for Subaru.
The 2020 Legacy has a stronger, more rigid platform versus the 2019 model. 
You can say this for Subaru: their timing is perfect. America just suffered through another polar vortex. The Midwest was turned into a beef locker and the Pacific Northwest got hit with the worst snowstorm in 70 years. But Subaru knew all this when they rolled out a new model at the Chicago Auto Show recently. In this case, that new model was the 2020 Subaru Legacy, a car billed for its all weather prowess.
For Rough Weather
You don’t see many Subies in places like Arizona. You see one every other week, and you think, “how can they stay afloat if this is all the cars they can sell?” Then you go to places less hospitable. Places like Bellingham, Washington or Boston and you see them all over the place. When the weather gets sloppy – rain, snow, ice, slush, mud, crud, and all sorts of swill – a Subaru is a very good choice.
Which is why taking a closer look at the 2020 Legacy is worth our time.
Performance Upgrades
As you’d expect, the new Legacy gets a Boxer engine and an all-wheel drive chassis that grips like a kitten on wall-to-wall carpet. However, this time around, the Legacy’s plant, a 2.4-liter four, is turbocharged for the first time since 2012. It cranks out 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft. of torque, which is healthy, if not earth-shattering. Downstream from the engine is a Lineartronic CVT with a manual mode and steering wheel shift paddles.
Put the power to the ground through all four skins and you hit 60 mph in 6.1 seconds. Nice! There is a non-turbo engine available; a 2.5-liter Boxer that puts out 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft. of torque, but you’ll want the one with the blower.
[bctt tweet=”As you’d expect, the new @subaru_usa Legacy gets a Boxer engine and an all-wheel drive chassis that grips like a kitten on wall-to-wall carpet.” username=”Automoblog”]
Structural Enhancements
The nitty-gritty on the suspension works like this. There’s MacPherson struts with a new internal rebound spring, aluminum lower L-arms, and a new 23mm hollow stabilizer bar up front. A double-wishbone subframe, coil springs, and a 19mm hollow stabilizer bar hold up the rear. Subaru says the 2020 Legacy’s platform is 70 percent stiffer in both torsional and front-suspension rigidity, and 100 percent stiffer in both front lateral flexural and rear subframe rigidity versus the prior platform. Crash protection also improves according to Subaru, as the new body absorbs over 40 percent more energy during front/side crashes.
RELATED
Mini Cooper SE: Electric Hardtop Is Ready For Driving!
All-season tires are standard and mounted on 17- or 18-inch alloy wheels and, duh, four-wheel ventilated disc brakes haul things to a stop.
Tech Features: A Laundry List
To say that the 2020 Subaru Legacy has tech features is like saying Jimi Hendrix was an okay guitar player. Right up front and in the middle, is a new, tablet-style 11.6-inch full HD multimedia display. It’s the central command for the multimedia and HVAC settings and the Near Field Communication features. Voice-activated navigation powered by TomTom (remember them?) is available. By contrast, the Base model gets a dual seven-inch display that splits the multimedia and HVAC controls.
Subaru’s Starlink system allows the driver to control entertainment and other vehicle settings through the touchscreen. The system supports Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and is Bluetooth capable. Available in-car Wi-Fi connectivity, a first in the Legacy, gets you hooked up to the interwebs.
And that’s just the touchscreen and all the stuff it does.
Elsewhere in the rather attractive cabin, you’ll find a new multi-layer instrument panel, 10-way power front seats with lumbar support, and heated front/rear seats. The heated steering wheel will be perfect for the next polar vortex. There are four USB ports (two front, two rear) plus one auxiliary input jack in front, and two 12-volt DC power sockets (one in the center console, one in the glove box). Also available: a 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, with Clari-Fi audio restoration tech and GreenEdge speakers.
Cargo Capacity: Load Up Your Luggage
Subaru says there’s more front shoulder room, more front and rear hip room, and more rear legroom. According to Subaru, the trunk at 15.1 cubic feet of cargo capacity can comfortably hold four full-size roller bags. There are mounting brackets on the roof for quick installation of a rack, box or tray. So dealing with stuff like surfboards, canoes, and other outdoor gear is a snap.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Subaru Legacy will hit dealers this fall. Trim levels include Base, Premium, Sport, Limited, Limited XT, and Touring XT. Pricing for the 2020 Legacy is reasonable across all trim levels, with the Base starting around $23,000.

2019/02/20,2019 VW Jetta GLI: A Brief Walk Around This Sporty Jetta,"The 2019 VW Jetta GLI is a sportier, more athletic version of the Jetta sedan.
Styling upgrades include 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and dual chrome exhaust
Performance upgrades include a limited-slip differential and multi-link rear suspension.
The sixth generation of Volkswagen’s Jetta GLI just rolled off the show stand in Chicago, and if you’ve got a thing for sporty sedans that won’t break your bank account, then this one is worth paying attention to. No, it’s not a BMW or an Alfa Giulia, but it’s almost as fast and costs significantly less. In a way, you could call the 2019 VW Jetta GLI the poor man’s Audi S4 (minus the all-wheel drive). It’s German, it’s screwed together right, it’s modern, and efficient.
On top of all that, VW has warrantied this thing up the wazoo: six-years/72,000-miles bumper-to-bumper.
Obviously, VW is serious here when it comes to the competition.
Upgraded Styling
The 2019 VW Jetta GLI features a coupe-like profile, over-sized grille, and sporty styling cues to make it more noticeable. There are LED projector headlights and LED daytime running lights flanking the black honeycomb grille, which features a red accent line. Out back, you’ll see standard LED taillights, a unique rear bumper, finned diffusor, dual chrome exhaust tips, and a special spoiler on the decklid.
Related: Good value for the money. Our full review of the 2019 VW Jetta.
Interior Treatments
The interior is dripping with tech and safety and multimedia trinkets. Styling-wise, it’s mainly black with red accents all over the place. The sport seats feature red stitching and are available in either cloth or Autobahn-perforated leather. Heated seats and dual-zone automatic climate control are there to keep you comfortable. Standard convenience features include automatic headlights, push-button start, rain-sensing wipers, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.
There’s ambient lighting and a 400-watt BeatsAudio system, which should blow your ears off.
On the tech front, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and MirrorLink are standard. The Jetta GLI includes VW’s Car-Net connected services and Digital Cockpit as well. And oh yeah, the safety stuff: Forward Collision Warning and Autonomous Emergency Braking (Front Assist); Blind Spot Monitor, Rear Traffic Alert, and the Automatic Post-Collision Braking System. All standard.
Power & Performance
Did I mention the word sport? I did, yes! To reinforce that notion, the 2019 VW Jetta GLI comes with a 2.0-liter turbo engine (EA888 TSI) with direct injection that cranks out 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. That is a lot for a sedan this size. To increase efficiency, the engine features VW’s variable valve timing and variable exhaust valve lift systems. Power gets to the front wheels through a standard, six-speed manual transmission, although a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic is on offer.

EPA-estimated fuel economy for the GLI is 25/32/28 mpg (city/highway/combined) regardless of transmission choice. A standard start/stop feature comes on the slush-boxes to further improve efficiency.
Suspension & Drive Modes
The 2019 VW Jetta GLI is suspended by an independent setup on all four corners. The strut-type configuration at the front and a multi-link arrangement out back combine for a ride height 0.6 inches lower than normal. The brakes are nabbed from the Golf GTI and Golf R, meaning 13.4-inch vented front discs strong enough to stop a freight train.
The new Jetta GLI is standard with VW’s VAQ electronically-controlled, torque-sensing limited-slip differential to reduce understeer.
You can even have fun with all the computer whatzits. There’s a Driving Mode Selection that allows you to customize the Jetta GLI’s behavior. You can choose from “Normal,” “Sport,” “Eco,” and “Custom.” Normal gives you a balanced driving experience while Sport is more dynamic with regard to the throttle and transmission. Sport also provides tighter steering and more spirited exhaust notes. Eco optimizes everything for fuel economy.
Custom allows you to monkey with the steering, throttle, front differential, engine notes, and climate control settings.

Pricing & Availability
The 2019 VW Jetta GLI will arrive at dealers this spring with a starting MSRP of $25,995. There’s also a 35th Anniversary model on tap that comes with red-striped black wheels, a black roof and spoiler, and an adaptive damping system.

2019/02/16,Infiniti QX Inspiration: The Potential of Empty Spaces & The Art of Origami,"The QX Inspiration is Infiniti’s foray into the EV market.
It has a pair of electric motors and an electric all-wheel drive system.
The coach doors, cab-forward design, and other styling elements are inspired by Japanese culture.
It’s hard to describe the Infiniti QX Inspiration Concept. After all, we’re talking about a concept car here. From the looks of it, the QX is a small and compact SUV on steroids. However, it does give the Lamborghini Urus and Maserati Levante a serious run for cash in terms of design. Despite this, I will reserve my final judgment until the production model is seen in the flesh. As we all know, concept cars are merely a stretch of the imagination.
You can even call them pipe dreams if you want.
But the biggest problem with concept cars is they are merely concepts, and the end result is usually a watered-down version of the original design. The Subaru WRX Concept in 2013, or the Pontiac Sunfire Concept in back 1990 suddenly come to mind.
And since the Infiniti QX Inspiration is a preview of what’s to come as the brand’s first fully-electric vehicle, I’m betting the production version will look pretty similar to the concept. It has to be. How else will it steal the thunder from the Audi e-tron and Jaguar I-PACE? Of course, it also has the Mercedes EQ C and Tesla Model S in its sights, so it better be more than just a looker.
Electrified Powertrain: An Inflection Point
Infiniti has yet to divulge any real crucial performance info about the QX Inspiration. Things like battery capacity, range, and torque ratings are forthcoming but it seems as if Infiniti wants us to think beyond horsepower ratings and top speed. For example, during the 2019 North American International Auto Show, the QX Inspiration won Best Future Concept in The Detroit News Readers’ Choice Awards.
We do know, however, there are two electric motors (one on each axle) and an e-AWD system. The latter is Infiniti-speak for electric all-wheel drive, similar to the electric Quattro drivetrain in the Audi e-tron SUV. The QX Inspiration is based on an entirely new platform, allowing the battery pack to live below the vehicle floor. Infiniti says this will help lower the center of gravity for more precise handling.
“The decision to electrify the Infiniti range was an inflection point for our brand,” explained Alfonso Albaisa, Senior Vice President for Global Design, Nissan Motor Company. “We started to understand the potential of new architectures and technologies and how they could influence a change in how we design our cars.”

Turning Japanese: Artistry & Imagination
Infiniti wants us mostly to focus on the origami-inspired styling and minimalist exterior design. With finely-balanced organic shapes and a mixture of straight lines, sharp creases, and smooth surfaces, the Japanese DNA is very much evident in the Infiniti QX Inspiration. The front has thin headlamps and an illuminated Infiniti logo. On the other hand, there is no grille or air intake on the front.
But the designers wisely retained the silhouette of an actual grille to give the QX Inspiration a very distinct look. This meant adopting an approach which focused on the open space between the concept’s lines. In particular, Infiniti’s designers were drawn to the character of paper and the art of origami.
“With the QX Inspiration concept, we were inspired by the Japanese concept of Ma, a focus on the lines and the empty space in between,” said Karim Habib, Infiniti Executive Design Director. “What is happening in that space between the lines – the free, natural flow of surfaces – is truly expressive. It’s the empty space between the edges that often carries the loudest message.”
Signature Styling Elements
The sharply-angled D-pillar contains a vermilion signature line to further define the cab-forward profile. Where other Infiniti SUVs have a long hood and a cab-rearward profile, the QX Inspiration is doing the opposite. To prove this point, the concept has shorter front and rear overhangs along with a shorter hood since there’s no need to house a burly gasoline motor.
“Where a V8 engine might move the interior rearward, electrification has allowed us to the move the interior forward and provides for a balanced profile,” Albaisa said.
The Infiniti QX Inspiration Concept rides on a 112.2-inch wheelbase and is about 64 inches in height. Overall length is 183.2 inches. It has the same exterior dimensions as the Mercedes-Benz GLC and BMW X3. In fact, the proportions are pretty similar to the Infiniti QX50 as well.
In the rear, the QX Inspiration literally shines. There’s a thin light bar that stretches across the tailgate. In addition, there’s an illuminated Infiniti script below the light bar to further add class and refinement. Everything looks crisp and neatly organized, with none of the cartoonist flare common to Japanese concept cars. Lastly, the QX Inspiration sits on louver-inspired 22-inch alloy wheels to complete the look.
Hospitable Interior: When Empty Spaces Talk
The Japanese are known for their bountiful hospitality, and the same can be said for the omotenashi-inspired interior of the Infiniti QX Inspiration. Thus, the hand-crafted interior is peppered with unique touches, including a Bianco Carrara marble center console, pillar-to-pillar widescreen display, soft ambient lighting, and sofa-like rear seats. The roof panel is even finished in full-grain Japanese red cedar wood.
RELATED
2020 Genesis G90: It’s a Whole Lot of Car
In fact, there’s so much going on with the interior that it’s hard to keep count.
“We have taken advantage of the EV architecture to develop a lounge-like interior, enabled by the flat floor and the empty space below the dashboard and center console. So really, we’re not just designing the objects inside the car, we’re designing the empty space between objects,” Habib said. “We’re trying to use that space to accentuate the design – you let the empty space talk as much, if not even more, than the forms and objects that are there.”
“Imagine someone clapping. The empty sound between claps is full of anticipation,” Albaisa added. “In this way, the electrification of Infiniti will bring a new simplicity and excitement to the brand.”
Putting It All Together
Infiniti is keen on joining the electric SUV bandwagon with the QX Inspiration Concept. From the looks of it alone, they have a winner here.
“QX Inspiration is the beginning of a new era for Infiniti, and an illustration of where we want to go with the brand,” Habib said. “New technology has given us the opportunity to evolve our design philosophy – and this new vehicle communicates the serene strength at our core.”

2019/02/15,Put A Sock In It! New Tech Makes The 2020 Ford Explorer More Quiet,"How do you keep a modern SUV as quiet as a church mouse? 
Easy: a state-of-the-art laboratory, a few microphones, and a librarian’s touch.  
Ford says the 2020 Explorer is the quietest one yet, calling it “Librarian-Approved.” That’s funny, clever, and probably true. It also shows just how far away from their truck-based ancestors modern SUVs are. It also points out what a modern SUV is expected to be: Civilized and Refined.
Ford goes so far as to say that today’s SUV buyers are “seeking peace behind the wheel.”
If Looks Could Kill
I’ve got a friend who is a librarian. She’s right out of central casting too. Red hair, glasses, cute, learned, smart, and capable of deploying, as she calls it, “My Mean Librarian Stare.” It’s that look we have all been on the receiving end of. It’s that look that says, “You best be shutting up right now, or your life will get a lot worse.” Somehow, Ford has figured out how to copy that with an SUV’s interior and, let’s just admit it’s a good thing.
Nobody likes a noisy car, not for very long anyway, and by dealing with this, Ford obliquely points to an interesting trend. SUVs and trucks are becoming evermore luxurious and refined. Here at Automoblog, we puzzle over this. Did you know pickup trucks are nudging up against six-figure prices? For a truck! Sure, SUVs are different, but Ford going more the direction of luxury and quiet just reinforces the trend.
Ford goes about this by combining a bunch of old school methods with newer technology. And it’s pretty cool.
Pin Drop
Ford’s first trick is to keep the noise makers as far removed from your ears as acoustically possible. Ford calls it “keeping the ‘vroom’ out of the room.” To this end, the Explorer has a new, dual-wall dashboard that aims to acoustically separate the cabin from vibrations that we perceive as humming sensations. The engine bay is divided from the passenger cabin by two walls, one of which is made of sheet-molded composite material, with an air gap. That dual-wall dashboard significantly reduces the sound that comes from a running engine.
The windshield and front side windows play a role in reducing cabin noise too. Rather than the single layer of glass, these guys get two, with the layers separated by a sheet of clear plastic. This acts as an acoustical buffer between the interior and the outside world. Think of them as a glass version of the multiple layers of the dual-wall dashboard.
RELATED
First GM-Ventec V+Pro Ventilators Ready for Delivery
Parker Lewis, Ford noise, vibration and harshness engineering manager, says keeping noise out of the cabin with the dual-wall dashboard is similar to the technology used to keep drinks hot or cold.
“This innovation is very similar in theory to an insulated thermos or mug,” he said. “The multiple layers of a mug keep unwanted ambient temperatures out, while the multiple layers of this dual-wall dashboard keep unwanted noise out of the vehicle cabin.”
Active Noise Control: How It Works
Now comes the cool tech solution to the noise puzzle, or the “secret silencer” of Active Noise Control. At the moment it’s only available on the Limited Hybrid, but you know it’ll make it into other models eventually.
Microphones throughout the cabin pick up unwanted frequencies; bangs, thumps, hisses and such that cause noisy interior conditions. The system cancels them out by producing sound waves that are 180 degrees out of phase with the originals. By pumping those new sounds through the audio system speakers, Presto-change-o! All the bad noises are gone.
You combine all this together: the dual-wall dashboard, acoustic glass, and the Active Noise Control and you get an Explorer with a noticeably quieter interior. Or, one librarians will supposedly love.
“Think of it as thunder on a stormy night,” Lewis added. “These sound waves bounce around us in a contained area, then the vehicle’s audio system speakers negate the thunder, essentially silencing the environment.”
Related: An in-depth look at the 2020 Ford Explorer.
Mission Control
Ford’s new driving dynamics lab is where all this magic happens prior to production. The lab allows engineers to test vehicles in different settings, including a semi-anechoic chamber with powered rollers to simulate road noise, and in temperatures ranging from minus 40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature swing causes squeaks and rattles as the materials expand and shrink within the vehicle.
Ford’s engineers can then monitor these changes and noises as they happen.
Different parts of the vehicle are tested in the lab’s anechoic chamber and reverberation suite. The first provides an area free of echo and reverberation and creates a pure working environment for sound. The second helps determine how noise permeates through full components or materials, like sheet metal.
The 2020 Explorer is the first to emerge from Ford’s new driving dynamics lab.
Manufacturing & Availability
The 2020 Ford Explorer is manufactured in The City of The Big Shoulders at the Chicago Assembly Plant. Expect it at Ford dealers this summer.

2019/02/13,2020 BMW 7 Series: The Big Boss Gets The Flagship Overhaul,"The 2020 BMW 7 Series is the epitome of flagship styling and comfort.
An extensive offering of new technology includes a night vision system. 
Expect more powerful engines and a plug-in hybrid option. 
I know what you’re thinking. Isn’t the new 8 Series the BMW flagship? Not a chance. The 2020 BMW 7 Series is coming to town, and it’s here to show other BMWs who the real boss is. The new 7 Series is a far cry from being a just another traditional luxury-sport sedan. Although previous models were more oriented towards comfort than outright sportiness, the 7 Series never lost that “ultimate-driving-machine” mentality.
In fact, the 2020 BMW 7 Series is proof that luxury, elegance, and prestige is still on the agenda. And there’s nothing wrong with that.
Fresh Face For The New Year
There is no denying that massive front grille. It is 40 percent larger than the kidney grille of the previous-generation 7 Series, and it looks remarkably similar to the one found on the massive BMW X7. It even comes with self-adjusting vanes that open automatically when the engine demands more cooling.
In order to further emphasize the taller and wider front, the 2020 BMW 7 Series gets a redesigned hood that extends to the top of the new grille. The lower part in the front bumper receives large air deflectors in place of conventional air intakes. However, those air deflectors are not useless pieces of styling ornamentation. They actually guide oncoming air to the brake air ducts and air curtains. The latter are located behind the front wheels to minimize turbulence around the wheel openings.
The 2020 BMW 7 Series is also one of the first BMW models to receive optional laser headlights. Yes, there are lasers in the front of the new 7 Series. According to BMW, lasers are 1,000 times more powerful than humdrum LED lights. This explains why BMW resisted the urge to equip the new 7 Series with larger headlights. Instead, they settled for slimmer units to give the vehicle a more stern and muscular fascia.
[bctt tweet=”Yes, there are lasers in the front of the new @BMW #7Series.” username=”Automoblog”]
More Powerful Engines
This is one of the most interesting parts about the 2020 BMW 7 Series. Although the new 7 Series receives a familiar choice of motors, all of them produce more power and torque; definitely not a bad thing to have in a German luxury car.
The base 740i receives a free-revving, 3.0-liter inline six with twin-scroll turbocharging and direct injection. The engine is good for 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft. of torque. The latter is available from a low 1,500 to 5,200 rpm. This is enough for a sprint to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds. The 740i xDrive can achieve the feat in 4.8 seconds.
But if you’re one of those 7 Series owners who demand more, the 4.4-liter V8 in the 750i is ripe for the picking. The twin-scroll, turbocharged engine is good for 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft. of torque, which is 80 more horsepower than the previous model. The twin-scroll turbochargers are nestled in the 90-degree angle between the two banks of cylinders.
When equipped with xDrive, the 750i rushes to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds.

Revised V12 & Hybrid Powertrain
Of course, what good is a new 7 Series without a new V12 motor to compliment it? The revised 6.6-liter V12 benefits from mono-scroll turbocharging and an all-aluminum construction. This enables the fire-breathing V12 to churn out an amazing 600 horsepower and 627 lb-ft. of torque. This allows the BMW 760i xDrive to sprint from zero to 60 mph in only 3.6 seconds.
The 2020 7 Series is also available as a plug-in hybrid. I have no idea why you should choose this variant, but BMW saw fit to install a six-cylinder motor instead of the previous turbocharged four-banger. Along with a new high-voltage lithium-ion battery pack and electric motor, the BMW 745e can dash to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds. The total combined power output for the 7 Series hybrid is 389 horsepower and 442 lb-ft. of torque. No word yet on the all-electric driving range, but I sincerely hope it’s more than 14 miles.
All engine variants are coupled with an eight-speed automatic. All-wheel drive or xDrive is standard across the range except for the base 740i.
[bctt tweet=”Of course, what good is a new @BMW #7Series without a new V12 motor to compliment it?” username=”Automoblog”]
More Flexible Suspension
The 2020 BMW 7 Series utilizes a double-wishbone front axle and a five-link rear axle in concert with an adaptive suspension system. BMW says the rear suspension is unique because it employs dual elastic bearings and specially-tuned “elastokinematics” for excellent directional stability. The adaptive system comes with electronically-controlled dampers and two-axle air suspension with automatic self-leveling. The air supply of the suspension is controlled individually for each wheel, meaning the new 7 Series will remain balanced even if it’s unevenly loaded.
Further, with the Driving Experience Control switch, you can adjust the damper settings manually based on your preferences. You can opt for a more comfortable or sporty ride and even raise or lower the suspension. For example, it can be raised by 0.8 inches at the touch of a button on bumpy road surfaces or steeply-angled driveways.
Softer Steering
The optional Integral Active Steering is something worth adding to the 2020 BMW 7 Series. BMW says the system combines the electro-mechanical and variable ratio steering of the front wheels with rear axle steering. Ultimately, this means the larger 7 Series is easier to maneuver. For example, at lower speeds, only small steering inputs are necessary becasue the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction of the front wheels to cut the turning radius.
By contrast, at higher speeds, the rear wheels follow the same direction as the front wheels, allowing the new 7 Series to better follow the course set by the driver.
Bristling With Technology
I was expecting the 2020 BMW 7 Series to come with everything (including the kitchen sink) and I’m not disappointed. On the safety front, the new 7 Series is standard with the Active Driving Assistant Package. The package includes collision and pedestrian warnings, automatic city braking, lane departure warning, and blind spot detection. On the other hand, ticking the option box for BMW’s Driving Assistant Professional adds active cruise control, lane keeping assist, collision avoidance, and automatic lane changing with evasion assistance.
Extended Traffic Jam Assistant is also part of this upgraded safety package. This system handles acceleration and braking and can, with the help of navigation, adjust the speed of the 7 Series for unexpected bends, turns, junctions, and roundabouts. In addition, the camera-based traffic sign recognition system uses navigation data to determine upcoming speed limits.

2019/02/13,Mazda Celebrates Miata Heritage With 30th Anniversary Edition Model,"The Mazda MX-5 Miata 30th Anniversary edition pays homage to the car’s legacy.
Unique and exclusive features include Racing Orange paint and special serial number badging.
Mazda dropped the 30th Anniversary edition Miata at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show recently. It was, after all, at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show when the Miata first graced the world. Despite all the expected amazement that these little guys have been around since the USSR was a thing, the Miata is still the best bang for your buck. Speaking of bucks, Mazda also let us know how much a new MX-5 is going to cost.
Hint: Not much.
One Small Disclaimer
In the service of fairness, openness, and transparency, let me just state on record (again) that I am totally biased in favor of Mazda Miatas. I’ve owned one for decades now and, unhesitatingly and truthfully say they are the best British car I’ve ever owned. There, now that we’ve dispensed with that, what do we have with the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata 30th Anniversary edition?
Related: Fabulous and fun: Our full review of the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF.
Orange Is The New Black
The most obvious thing about the 30AE is the color: Orange. Now, orange isn’t a bad color, just a tricky color. It’s sort of like yellow, hard to get right, easy to get wrong. Mazda, with this Racing Orange paint job, gets it right on the 30th Anniversary Miata. It’s neither glaring nor too brownish. If you like orange in general (and I know some of you do), then you won’t mind getting a 30th Anniversary Miata because of the color.
The 30th Anniversary Miata comes in both soft top and RF configurations; the RF being that odd, yet workable retractable hardtop/targa top arrangement that is as striking as it is practical. The roof on the RF is in matching Racing Orange, while the soft top comes in black cloth. There’s orange on the inside too, with orange interior louvers and orange piping on the heated RECARO sport seats. Ah yes, heated seats. It seems like excessive hedonism, until you’ve dropped the top on a brisk October morning.
Then you realize heated seats are a minor miracle.
Slightly More Than Spartan
This is not a bare bones minimalist sports car of yore, no it is not. Standard on the 30th Anniversary Miata are things like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto – naturally, since seemingly every car these days comes with those. Also standard is SiriusXM with a three-month subscription, along with SiriusXM Traffic Plus and Travel Link complimentary subscriptions.

All seem rather handy and enjoyable, if you don’t mind subscribing to yet another service in your life.
The special edition Miatas are wrapped in Alcantara leather (nice), which is also found along the door inserts and lower instrument panel (also nice).
Power & Performance: An Optimum Balance
Like all other Gen 4 Miatas, the 30AE is powered by the SKYACTIV-G 2.0-liter four-banger, cranking out a healthy 181 horsepower and 151 lb-ft. of torque. That’s a 17 percent increase over the prior generation. Given that the Gen 4 Miata has only gained around 300 lbs. over the first go round – meaning it tips the scales at around 2,400 lbs. today – 181 ponies are enough.
Or a great start, if you’re one of those modifying fools/good friends of mine.
Related: Could the Miata outpace one of history’s top muscle cars?
Pricing & Availability
Mazda has a tendency to gouge you on their special editions, but this time around, it’s not really all that bad. The manual soft tops run around $35,000 (about $500 more for the automatic) and the RFs are $37,000 to $38,000 depending on if you want the automatic or not.
But don’t get your hopes up.
Only 3,000 are being made worldwide. And I read on a Miata forum last night they’ve already sold out. ARGH!

2019/02/09,2020 Kia Sportage: Refreshed & Ready To Mingle,"On the heels of an emotional Super Bowl ad for the Telluride, Kia is staying on the gas in 2019. While the Telluride is the largest member of Kia’s house, the Sportage is no couch potato. Refreshed and recharged for another round, the 2020 Kia Sportage comes with a handful of tech and safety upgrades.
Those not looking for the space (or cost) of a larger SUV may find the new Sportage does the trick. We would opt for the new S trim personally, which has a more athletic exterior look. Yet, regardless of trim level, the 2020 Kia Sportage will get the job done on the daily commute.
And it will look mighty good while doing it.
Sweeping Lines & Curves
In today’s increasingly crowded SUV market, the 2020 Kia Sportage uses its European flair to stand out. As soon as the pencil hit the design pad, it became about “sweeping lines” and “thought-provoking” curves, says Kia. After establishing the lines and curves, designers went for the proportions and overall stance. Again, the idea was to make the Sportage easily recognizable.
Of course, the newly-available 19-inch alloy wheels are hard to miss.
The front grille and bumper are both new as are the headlights and projector-beam fog lamps. LED turn indicators, headlights, and fog lamps are optional. We recommend adding each of those lighting upgrades, especially for those who frequently drive late at night. At the rear, the 2020 Kia Sportage receives another new bumper and special taillight trim.
A sleek Steel Grey metallic exterior color is also available.
“Lightly Enhanced” Interior
On the inside, Kia says things are “lightly enhanced” which made us smile. Those “light” enhancements include an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Andriod Auto standard; modem-enabled telematics and navigation are optional. Those on the go will want the available smartphone charging tray.
Power & Performance: Two Solid Options
The 2020 Kia Sportage offers two engines and both are sufficient for the daily commute. The more modest 2.4-liter produces a respectable 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft. of torque. For those quicker jaunts onto the freeway, a 2.0-liter turbo creates nearly 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. While the extra snort of a turbo is always nice, there’s nothing wrong with saving the money and going with the smaller powerplant.
Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic. Fuel economy figures for the 2020 Sportage are not available yet, but it’s reasonably safe to believe the numbers will be on par with the 2019 Sportage. Our only critique here is having more gears “in the box.” An eight or nine-speed transmission would benefit the Sportage in terms of performance and efficiency, but we trust Kia regardless with this six-speed automatic.

Pricing & Availability
Trim levels include the LX, EX, SX, and the more sporty-looking S. Kia says the new Sportage arrives this spring, with pricing information due closer to then. In the meantime, the 2020 Kia Sportage is on display at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show.

2019/02/08,Pathfinder Rock Creek Edition: Nissan Stacks On The Goodies,"The Rock Creek Edition jazzes up Nissan’s evergreen SUV.
Many of the exterior treatments are blacked-out or darkened. 
The special-edition Pathfinder has a V6 engine with direct injection. 
Nissan just keeps cranking out the Pathfinder, and why shouldn’t they? I see these things all over the place – yes, I live in a rural area – but the interesting thing is that I still see the original versions from 1987 out there. That’s a testament to durability and longevity that any car maker would love to see. Fast forward to today, and Nissan is rolling out the Pathfinder Rock Creek Edition at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show.
Bringing The Goods
The Rock Creek Edition is a package of goodies, not an entirely different truck. But the good thing is that, by putting all these items together, Nissan can cut the price way back. The package runs $995, which saves you a whopping $1,315 against the same equipment if you were to buy them separately. Thank you Nissan! And to make the deal even nicer, the Rock Creek Edition is available on both the SV and SL grades, in both two-wheel and four-wheel drive configurations.
So you don’t have to go all top-of-the-line, full-zoot to get the goods.
Related: The 2019 Nissan Armada and Frontier receive new upgrades.
Design Treatments: Lots of Black!
The differences, exterior wise, between the Rock Creek Edition and the standard Pathfinders are numerous. It starts with the darkened 18-inch wheels and 255/60R18 all-season tires, and ends with a lot of black. The mesh grille, roof rails, door handles, outside mirrors, front and rear fascia accents, and license plate finisher: yes, all black!
There are black-molded overfenders and 4WD badges along with unique badging on the front doors.
Of course, the inside of the Pathfinder Rock Creek Edition gets some changes and upgrades. Two-tone seating surfaces and badging, for a start, along with high-contrast stitching on those seats. The door cards, console lid, and steering wheel get the stitching treatment too. All 2019 Pathfinder models seat seven.
Power & Performance: A Towing Machine
All Pathfinder Rock Creek Editions feature a standard trailer hitch and harness and splash guards. Both the 4WD and 2WD boast an impressive 6,000 lbs. towing capacity. No doubt that’s thanks in large part to the 284 horsepower and 259 lb-ft. of torque coming from the 3.5-liter V6. So yeah, you can haul stuff like your two-axle recreational trailers, jet skis, ATVs, campers, and all your other toys.

All 2019 Pathfinder models come with Automatic Emergency Braking.
Two Extra Packages
Nissan also offers up two additional options: The SV Rock Creek Edition Technology Package and the SL Rock Creek Edition Premium Package. The first will tack on an additional $980 at final check out, but you get NissanConnect with Navigation and Services, SiriusXM Traffic, heated cloth front seats, a heated steering wheel, and heated outside rearview mirrors. A nice option for you ski bums and snowboard rats.
The second package, which will run you another $2,110, adds a Bose 13-speaker premium audio system and a power panoramic moonroof.
Pricing & Availability
To put it all together: the 2019 Nissan Pathfinder is offered in two-wheel and four-wheel drive. Grade levels include the S, SV, SL, and Platinum. The Rock Creek Edition upgrade runs $995 while the Technology and Premium Package run $980 and $2,110 respectively.
In Person
The Pathfinder Rock Creek Edition will be on display at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show, February 9th through the 18th. Expect it at Nissan dealers this fall.

2019/02/07,VW Dune Buggy Concept: Where EVs & The 1960s Meet,"VW’s concept is inspired by the American buggies from the 1960s and ‘70s.
This modern Dune Buggy showcases the flexibility of VW’s latest EV platform.
It doesn’t look like a production version is coming but we won’t give up hope.
When I first saw pictures of the VW Dune Buggy, I thought it was a prop for some upcoming sci-fi movie. Tron II – Electric Tron-a-Loo or something. But no, VW is serious. Or as serious as you can be with a show car. Which is what the Dune Buggy – officially called the ID. BUGGY – is at this year’s Geneva International Motor Show.
Oh, did I mention it’s an EV?
Planning Ahead
VW is serious about their electric vehicle ambitions. They have to be. Since that diesel-gate debacle pretty much rang the death knell for consumer diesels, VW knows it has to go somewhere non-ICE. So get ready for EV (almost) everything from Der Peoples Kar. So, as strange as it may seem, VW is pretty serious with an off-road EV.
Home-Brewed Concoctions
Funny thing is, the original dune buggies back in the 1960s weren’t VW products. They were cobbled-up, home-brew specials made from Beetle parts, not direct from the factory. As I recall, it all started with this guy named Bruce Meyer. Although generically referred to as “dune buggies,” his was officially dubbed the “Meyer Manx.” The Manx was the original seed for seemingly endless “specials” made on Beetle platforms. There were little vans, Porsche-like speedsters, crazy race-car-looking things, and of course, endless variations on the Dune Buggy.
But how could there not be? It was the 60s! The Beach Boys! Frankie & Annette! Ride the Wild Surf! Dick Dale! Greg Noll! This was a vehicular manifestation of the collective need of every teenager not to live in Iowa and get to the beach.
[bctt tweet=”There were little vans, Porsche-like speedsters, crazy race-car-looking things, and of course, endless variations on the #DuneBuggy.” username=”Automoblog”]
Blast From The Past
And have you ever driven one of these things? They’re a total hoot. No doors, no roof; they weigh next to nothing and the suspension is robust enough to handle (literally) bounding over dunes. Of course, those are also the biggest flaws. They make perfect sense getting from Hermosa Beach down to Rincon to catch a better swell, but commuting from Joliet into Chicago for a client meeting in February?
Just like the originals, this Dune Buggy has no fixed roof or conventional doors, and the open side sills dominate the overall look. The reinforced windscreen frame and the Targa bar (open at the side) provide rollover support. A black tarp can be stretched between the windscreen frame and the Targa bar for protection against the elements. The wheels and large off-road tires (BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/As) are borderline goofy and cartoon-like.

The top half is painted in matte Fern Green, while the bottom is a textured Grey Tech Blue.
Showcasing New Platforms
Unfortunately, they’re not going to make a production version of the thing (although that would be rad). Like I said, they are serious but in a different way. What this actually allows is for VW to show off their engineering skill with regard to future EV platforms. This Dune Buggy concept is based on VW’s modular electric drive matrix, or “MEB.” The idea is to demonstrate how multifaceted and flexible this new platform is.
The Dune Buggy is VW’s way of saying, “Look at our MEB. It works in trucks, it works in cars, and you can even have fun with it!” And that’s a very smart move. Nobody is going to buy an EV to show they are more hair-shirt than thou. Then VW says this: “The new MEB concept vehicle shows that this fully electric platform can be used for more than just large-scale series production models. Like the Beetle chassis of yesteryear, the MEB has the potential to facilitate the development of low-volume niche vehicles.”
That sounds like a major corporation egging us on to take this platform and mess around with it as we see fit. Now doesn’t that sound like fun?
Global Appeal
Worldwide, around 250,000 vehicles were built as one-offs or at low volumes through the 1980s. I’m assuming they mean Beetle-based stuff, so VW gets a solid two-base hit. One, they show off their upcoming MEB electric vehicle platform, and two, they hint at releasing it to the hardcore gearhead shade-tree tinkerers out there.
VW Dune Buggy In Person
Anyway, I’d love to stay, but I heard there’s a big swell heading for Steamer Lane, so I gotta run. In the meantime, you can catch the Dune Buggy during the Geneva International Motor Show starting on March 7th.
Later brah!

2019/02/05,Audi TT 20th Anniversary Edition: The Tradition Continues,"The Audi TT 20th Anniversary Edition will receive a limited-production run.
Design elements include the original “baseball stitch” and commemorative badging.
Available as either a coupe or roadster with a 2.0 liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine.
I must be getting old. Has the Audi TT really been around for 20 years? Maybe I’d remember that if it had kept some of its original pizzazz instead of slowly fading into “just another sports coupe” territory. Or maybe it would have made more of an impact, year after year, if the performance matched the (original) style. But anyway, here we are. Audi is rolling out a 20th anniversary edition to remind us what we’ve forgotten.
Carrying On The Tradition
Audi says the TT 20th Anniversary Edition features “unique design elements that celebrate the heritage of the Audi TT and embody the model’s transcendent design.” That might be true, but the first thing I notice is that nowhere does Audi say what counts as “limited.” They could be making 40 of these things, they could be making 40,000 but I can’t really tell.
That aside, I can’t really argue with Audi calling it a “transcendent design.”
When the TTS Roadster concept study hit the stand at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show, people were very impressed. It was clean and direct, a design dominated by arcs and finished in a cool silver gray. A car like the TT couldn’t have been designed in Italy or France, this thing had to be German. Audi, naturally, wants to carry this on with the TT 20th Anniversary Edition.
Design Appeal
It’ll come as both a coupe and roadster, painted either Aviator Gray pearl metallic or Nimbus Gray metallic. I can’t really see what the difference is, but we do know Nimbus Gray will be exclusive to the United States. As a nod to the original TT from the Tokyo show, all models will feature Mocasin Brown Fine Nappa leather with custom yellow contrast stitching. (Yes, I know that’s not the way you spell “Moccasin,” but Audi chooses to spell it that way).
On top of the two select paint colors, the TT 20th Anniversary Edition features high-gloss black exterior trim and 19-inch, five-arm-design wheels painted in gunmetal, natch. When you get into a cool, gray Teutonic-style jag, why stop? The trumpet-style stainless steel exhaust is exclusive to the model, as are the OLED taillights which are only available on the TT RS.
Badges? You bet this TT’s got badges: “20 Years of TT” badging adorns the front fenders, alongside the matte-finish Audi rings etched into the rear sills.

Interior & Technology Treatments
Naturally the Ingolstadt firm has worked over the interior. The S Sport seats, door armrests, steering wheel, and center console all get the aforementioned Mocassin Brown Fine Nappa leather with bespoke yellow contrast stitching. This harkens back to the “baseball stitching” in the original TT, which I always loved but owners told me it was kind of a pain to live with.
Of course there are interior badges marking the TT’s production number alongside a “TT 20 Years” icon.
What counted as high-tech gadgetry 20 years ago wouldn’t even past muster these days, and Audi is not going to leave their special TT behind. The standard Audi phone box with wireless charging and signal booster is on-board, along with the standard Technology package that includes Audi’s virtual cockpit, MMI navigation plus, smartphone integration (with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.
Related: Virtual Showdown: Tesla Model S vs. Audi e-tron GT Concept.
Power & Performance
The Audi TT 20th Anniversary Edition is not a no-go-show-boat, but it’s not a full-out Bahn burner either. Powered by an evergreen 2.0 liter four-cylinder turbo engine, Audi’s special TT puts out 228 horsepower. It comes with a standard seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission. Nice, love that tranny! Add it up, and the anniversary coupe can haul from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds. Not that bad at all.
The roadster is slightly slower, hitting 60 in 5.5 seconds. Still not that bad.
Pricing & Availability
The Audi TT 20th Anniversary Edition is on sale now. The coupe starts at $52,900 and the roaster begins at $56,800. Which is about what you’d figure.

2019/02/04,Jaguar F-TYPE Checkered Flag: A Limited-Edition F-TYPE For 2020,"Jaguar, the most successful of British sports car companies, just announced a new model – variant actually – to their 2020 lineup, the F-TYPE Checkered Flag. The limited-edition model will be available as both a coupe and convertible and, like all Jags, will be as gorgeous as it is fast.
Based off of the Jaguar F-TYPE R-Dynamic Coupe and Convertible, the Checkered Flag is offered with either a four or six-cylinder engine. Obviously, I’d go with the six, but theoretically the four-banger could be fun. And it should make for a lighter car.
Visual Enhancements
The Jaguar F-TYPE Checkered Flag comes with a bunch of subtle “visual enhancements” (i.e. badges and such) for the exterior, while the “1+1” cabin is also set apart from its more plebian brethren. Comically, Jaguar refers to the Checkered Flag as having a “1+1” seating arrangement. That’s a pretentious way of saying it’s a two-seater, just like true sports cars always are.
Obviously, with a name like this F-TYPE has, Jag is leaning heavily on the brand’s prolific heritage, dating back to the XK120 in 1948. The Checkered Flag version is further set apart by a Black Contrast roof on the Coupe, a not-all-that-bad styling choice used rather nicely by the Corvette and various big Ferrari coupes.
Spartan the Jaguar F-TYPE Checkered Flag is not, with a standard InControl Touch Pro infotainment system with Meridian audio (nice!). Along with a collection of other “connected services,” Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard. Everything is accessed through a 10-inch touchscreen.
Interior & Exterior Treatments
The inside is drowning in plush Windsor Leather and performance seats with embossed headrests, a nice styling touch. The center console gets a Dark Brushed Aluminum trim finisher (Jag capitalizes stuff in the oddest ways) and the steering wheel is emblazoned with a distinct Checkered Flag logo.
There is a red leather band at 12 o’clock so you always know (hopefully) which way is up.
The exterior of this special F-TYPE includes extended side sills to cleverly increase visual width, while giving the car a greater sense of charisma and grace. The wheels are big 20-inch Gloss Black jobs, carrying on with that fine Coventry tradition of bolting on huge wheels. The rims are exclusive to the Checkered Flag Limited Edition and contrast wickedly with the red brake calipers.
Power & Performance: Two Solid Options
As I said, you get your choice of two plants. First, there’s a 296 horsepower, 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder Ingenium gasoline engine. Which seems fine. It probably revs easier than the big six, and it’ll get better gas mileage (if you care about that stuff). Speaking of the six, that would be a 380 horsepower, 3.0-liter supercharged V6. Yes, I get the packaging and weight issues, but a big Jag without a big, straight six still seems odd to me.

Both lumps are mated to an eight-speed “Quickshift” transmission, which I think is Coventry’s way of saying nice, but automatic trannies. Alas.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Jaguar F-TYPE Checkered Flag Limited Edition starts at $71,900, which is actually kind of reasonable. That’s right in the same ballpark as various BMW and Mercedes-Benz coupes. No word yet on when it’ll be gracing the polished floors of Jaguar dealers.

2019/01/30,2019 Nissan Maxima: Athletic. Luxurious. But Too Expensive?,"The 2019 Nissan Maxima gets a styling refresh for the new year. 
It retains its powerful V6 motor but the transmission is a gray area.
The new Maxima is luxurious but the price point may scare buyers off. 
Ah yes, the Maxima. This is purportedly Nissan’s four-door sports car. That’s a bold claim if you ask me. However, even past models of the Nissan Maxima came equipped with strong and bulletproof motors. It also came with sporty handling and a taut ride, which is a Maxima trademark. It’s good to know the 2019 Nissan Maxima retained its sporting attributes.
But despite the inherent athleticism, it also comes with a healthy dose of luxury.
If this sounds like the 2019 Nissan Maxima is catering to a special niche of buyers, you’re right. And that’s before we get to the rather expensive price tag. The new Maxima commands a steeper price than the new Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and even the gorgeous Mazda 6, which are all excellent in their own right.
[bctt tweet=”It’s good to know the 2019 #Nissan Maxima retained its sporting attributes.” username=”Automoblog”]
Flagship Styling
The 2019 Nissan Maxima is blessed with aggressive styling updates. For example, the front fascia has a new grille while a deeper V-motion design gives the face a more prowling stance. It also gets standard jewel-like LED headlamps and daytime running lights for a more modern look.
The new Maxima still retains the ridiculous curving line on top of the front fenders. It is hard to miss. The line dramatically slopes downwards as it intersects with the front door. And while this design feature is a bit controversial (or polarizing depending on your tastes), it gives the Maxima a purposeful stance. The Kodo-inspired Mazda 6 has this as well, but the lines are softer and more organic.
The rear styling has been treated to some flagship updates as well, like quad-tip exhaust finishers and LED taillights. If you opt for the Maxima SR, you also get a new rear spoiler. In general, the 2019 Nissan Maxima comes with new 19-inch alloy wheels, new premium paint colors, and new leather upholstery.
Powerful & Lively Motor
No four-door sports car is complete without a powerful motor. And while the 3.5-liter VQ V6 in the 2019 Nissan Maxima lacks the burly attitude of a proper V8, it feels like it can churn out more than the claimed 300 horsepower. And while the performance-oriented Xtronic CVT transmission simulates actual gears (if you press hard on the gas pedal that is), I do have minor qualms about the durability and reliability of this particular unit.
RELATED
Lamborghini Ramps up Surgical Mask Production
The Xtronic CVT in the 2019 Nissan Maxima is manufactured by JATCO or Japanese Automatic Transmission Company. JATCO is a subsidiary of Nissan and supplies automatic transmissions to other major car makers like Volkswagen, Subaru, Land Rover, Isuzu and, until recently, Mazda. And if you know anything about modern cars, the Xtronic transmission is not exactly the last word in terms of reliability.
However, I find this surprising.
My wife’s 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage came standard with a JATCO-2 CVT. The car has racked up 100,000 miles, but the CVT is still tight as a drum. Sadly, this is not the case for other Nissan vehicles that use the same JATCO CVT units. I sincerely hope the CVT in the 2019 Nissan Maxima is capable of lasting more than 60,000 miles. Only time will tell.
Premium & Luxurious Appointments
The interior is the reason why the 2019 Nissan Maxima commands a higher price. The Maxima is certainly more luxurious than the Sentra and Altima, but beyond that, it’s often a step above other entry-level luxury cars. And this has been the case for more than 20 years. In 1995, for example, Nissan held off Lexus as the Maxima took home Motor Trend’s Import Car of the Year Award. The magazine’s Jeff Bartlett quotes one survey respondent at the time who said “it’s definitely a luxury car at a reasonable price.”
The new Maxima is still a luxurious car. But reasonable price? Considering the starting MSRP of common sedans like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Mazda6, the term “reasonable price” is up for debate today.
Pricing & Trim Levels
The base Maxima S ($33,450) comes with an eight-inch touchscreen display, dual zone automatic climate control with rear vents, and a power driver’s seat. The Maxima SV starts at $35,960 and comes with sumptuous leather upholstery, heated front seats, and door-to-door navigation. The Maxima SL, starting $38,440, includes a panoramic moonroof, a Bose premium audio system with 11 speakers, and a heated steering wheel.
For just under $40,000 you can opt for the Maxima SR. This model comes with 19-inch gloss-black alloy wheels, ascot leather seats with diamond-stitched Alcantara inserts, and a sport-tuned suspension.
The Platinum trim is yours starting at $41,440 and comes with machine-finished alloys and a memory driver’s seat. Finally, the Maxima Platinum Reserve includes dark hyper silver alloy wheels, semi-aniline leather seating with a charcoal headliner, and heated rear seats.

2019/01/29,McLaren 600LT Spider: One Very Impressive Hair Dryer,"In terms of performance, the McLaren 600LT Spider is on par with the 600LT Coupé.
Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires increase on-track dynamics and driver engagement.
The 600LT Spider is the fifth car to carry the Longtail (LT) namesake.
McLaren thought it was a good idea if they’d cut the top off their impressive Longtail and turn it into a Spider. Who am I to argue? I love convertibles. Besides, this is no boulevard showboat. With nearly 600 ponies on tap and a 200 plus mph top speed, think of the McLaren 600LT Spider as a very impressive hair dryer.
Even though it’s a drop-top, the 600LT Spider fully exemplifies the McLaren Longtail philosophy. More power, less weight, optimized aerodynamics, and track-oriented capabilities.
Fit & Trim
The McLaren 600LT Spider drops 220.5 lbs. over the 570S Spider it replaces. That’s a lot of weight savings, like losing a fat passenger. The 600LT Spider uses the same carbon fiber MonoCell II chassis as the Coupé. However, even though the top of the box is chopped off, it retains the structural rigidity of the Coupé with no additional strengthening bits, according to McLaren. So in all, Coupé to Spider, the convert only gains 110.2 lbs. Not bad!
All up, the dry weight is just 2,859.4 lbs. for the Spider, which is pretty good. You can even delete the audio and climate control systems if you really want to drop the weight.
Power & Performance
The McLaren 600LT Spider features the same twin-turbo 3.8-liter V8 as the Coupé, kicking out 592 horsepower and 457 lb-ft. of torque. A dual-clutch, seven-speed gearbox with “Ignition Cut” facilitates faster changes in Sport mode. The McLaren 600LT Spider hits 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and 124 in just 8.4 seconds! It maxes out at 201 mph with the roof up; 196 mph with it down. Nice!
That zero to 124 mph figure is a mere 0.2 seconds slower than the 600LT Coupé. Not bad!
Open Air Enjoyment
The hardtop roof is more secure and wear-resistant than the traditional fabric version, and offers a Coupé-like cabin when it’s up. When stowed, the roof hides beneath a tonneau cover located just behind the seats. The top is raised or lowered at the push of a button up to 25 mph. And, I’ve got to say, being able to drop your top while on the move is so cool. I love when car companies let you do this.
An electrically-operated wind deflector can be raised independently of the hardtop to increase ventilation or to allow more of those sweet exhaust notes into the cabin. The 600LT Spider has unique top-exit exhausts that should sound fantastic and loud when your hair is blowing around.

Pricing & Availability
As with the Coupé, availability of the 600LT Spider will be limited although orders are being taken now. McLaren is not like others: they don’t churn out cars like so many appliances. Of course, with that limited availability comes a (fairly) high price: $256,500. Yes, that’s a lot, in overall terms, but in the high-end sports car realm, that’s about average. And this is a McLaren here. You won’t be disappointed.
Every 600LT car is hand-built at the McLaren Production Centre in Woking, Surrey, England.

Standard features for the 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid Limited ($42,800) include 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic LED headlights, heated mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated and power-adjustable front seats, premium leather upholstery, 60/40-split folding rear seats, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.
On the technology front, the Limited comes with a Wi-Fi hotspot, nine-inch touchscreen, rearview camera, wireless charging pad, and Bluetooth capability. Toyota’s Entune infotainment system provides smartphone-based navigation, four USB ports, Apple CarPlay and iPod connectivity, and an eight-speaker audio system with satellite and HD radio.
Features & Options: Safety & Luxury
Toyota’s Safety Sense suite of advanced safety features is extensive. Drivers benefit from forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane keeping assist, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. The package also includes a blind-spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert. Further, Toyota’s Safety Connect program is available for additional peace of mind while traveling.
An Advanced Safety package ($1,150) with a surround-view parking camera and rear parking sensors with automatic braking came on our Limited tester.
Lastly, the Limited trim receives upgraded exterior lighting, a sunroof, heads-up display, ventilated front seats, driver-seat memory settings, and a heated steering wheel. On the inside, drivers will enjoy the wood trim, ambient lighting, and 14-speaker premium JBL audio system.
Total MSRP including destination: $44,870. By comparison, the 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid starts at $36,500. 
Interior Highlights: Attractive & Warm 
The Avalon cabin is modern, stylish, and thoughtfully planned out. Our tester came with an attractive all-black motif, contrast stitching, and plenty of soft-touch materials. The interior materials are of excellent quality, with matching wood grains, metallic trim, and attractive black surfaces. The heated and cooled front seats and supple leather are especially comfortable during the winter. 
The controls are easy to find and use, unlike many luxury cars on the market. There’s a handy smartphone charger just ahead of the gear shifter, which opens underneath to a nice cubby space for valuables. The heated steering wheel now comes standard on the Limited, which we made liberal use of during a recent Denver snowstorm.
The back comes with its own climate controls and heated seats. There’s plenty of legroom and headroom in the back for taller adults. The Hybrid gets a bit smaller trunk (14 cubic feet) to house the battery underneath.
Engine & Fuel Mileage Specs
The Avalon Hybrid’s powertrain consists of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, mated with two motors tucked into the transaxle. Those motors are sustained by nickel-metal hydride batteries. Power is sent to the front wheels by way of a planetary, power-split continuously variable transmission. The system combines for 215 horsepower, up from 200 horsepower versus the previous model.
The outgoing Hybrid was an EPA-estimated 40/39 city/highway and 40 combined mpg. The 2019 models improve to 43/43 city/highway and 43 combined. We averaged 38.4 mpg during our week with the full-size sedan.
Driving Dynamics: Easy To Handle But Difficult In Snow
The Avalon drives like a much smaller car. We were able to navigate Denver without issue. We found the big sedan actually thrives in urban environments, especially in stop-and-go traffic. For example, the Hybrid system can sustain speeds of up to 25 mph on battery power alone. Considering it can go 680 miles on a singe tank of regular unleaded gas, the 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid would be great for a realtor who uses their car as an office. Passengers would be comfy riding around looking at houses.
The ride is smooth thanks to special shock absorbers and large anti-roll bars that offer up capable and controllable handling. The suspension has been retuned with the Limited for a comfort-oriented setup. 
If you live in cold climates, the only downside is the Avalon does not offer all-wheel drive. We got stuck in a heavy, wet Denver snowstorm in the mountains west of the city. However, with all-wheel drive, it would take away from the Avalon’s impressive fuel economy.
Conclusion: Comfortable For Work or Pleasure
The 2019 Toyota Avalon Hybrid is a full-size sedan that gets impressive fuel mileage. For those hauling clients around, it’s an excellent choice as an office on wheels. It’s quiet and comfortable and the cabin is stylish and modern.

2019/01/26,2020 GMC Sierra HD: New Towing Tech & An Allison Upgrade,"The 2020 GMC Sierra HD pickup is due later this year with increased towing capacity.
The Allison transmission gets a major upgrade on the taller, more robust 2020 Sierra HD.
The list of towing technology is impressive: cameras, smartphone apps – the whole nine yards.
The 2020 GMC Sierra HD pickup will soon be here, and besides having the design of a Soviet-era apartment building, it’s a pretty amazing piece of work. What’s also amazing is that I get to write about it, because most of the time, Carl Anthony gets all the truck stuff around the office.
Some guys have all the luck but today, I get to have some fun!
Truck Talk
Funny thing about the racing world, or at least the more amateur end of it, is that you spend a lot of time talking about trucks. As enjoyable as it would be to drive your vintage racer directly to the next track, most likely you’re going to have to tow it there in a trailer. So there’s lots of conversation in the paddock about highway MPG and torque and how your new truck handles a trailer.
GMC must be thinking ahead, because one of the things they focus on, right up front, is how the new Sierra HD handles towing stuff.
“Trailering is the most important consideration for Sierra Heavy Duty customers,” said Jaclyn McQuaid, GMC Vehicle Chief Engineer, Heavy Duty Trucks. “The new features and technologies in the 2020 Sierra HD make it easier than ever to hitch a trailer and tow it confidently.”
See what I mean?
Towing Tools
GMC calls their towing control scheme the ProGrade Trailering System. This deal includes a whole orchestra of command and control devices to help keep things on the straight and narrow. For example, there are 15 unique camera views, including a creepy thing called “transparent trailer” view. This view helps drivers see around their Sierra HD and trailer.
Further, there’s the iN-Command system that functions like a smart home, monitoring and controlling an array of systems in supported trailers. It can do things like turn on the trailer’s water heater or air conditioning, check holding tank levels, or monitor fuel levels on trailers with generators. Handy!
Related: Use these pro tips to help you tow that trailer with ease.
Other long-haul towing gizmos include Trailer Light Test, Trailer Electrical Diagnostics, Trailer Tire Pressure and Temperature Monitoring, Pre-Maintenance Reminders, and a Departure Checklist. A lot of these work through the myGMC mobile app but it doesn’t end there. The Auto Electric Park Brake feature automatically applies your parking brake (a bonus when hitching up), while Park Grade Hold Assist adjusts braking effort for an extended period of time.

Tow/Haul mode, Trailer Sway Control with integrated trailer brakes, and Diesel Exhaust Braking carry over from previous models. Finally, there are larger, door-mounted trailering mirrors with power extension and retraction.
Power & Performance: The Allison Gets Upgraded
Grunt for hauling your toys is provided by the evergreen Duramax diesel and Allison transmission, a pairing that is pretty sweet. The 6.6 turbo-diesel plant offers what GMC humble-brags as “high torque.” How much? 910 lb-ft. of it! Which is, you know, a lot! Ponies clock in at 445, and if those horsepower numbers don’t add up for you, then I don’t know what you’re trying to pull down the road.
The gearbox, an all-new 10-speed Allison automatic, has closer gear spacing. This means optimal rev range is found at all times regardless of load and terrain conditions. Thank you GMC.
GMC says the bigger frame and stronger propulsion system deliver “greater towing capacity than previous models.” By which they mean well in excess of 30,000 lbs! Which, by my calculations, is more than enough for a two-car Formula Ford team with a lot of spares!
Interior Treatments: Denali Tops The List
It’s all nice and stuff in the cab. Leather and USB ports and touchscreens and brushed aluminum and all that. Definitely nice and all, but this a truck and will be used (presumably) as such. All these creature comforts are becoming more and more important, however. There are (seemingly) dozens of truckers out there that want you to know they are more than just clod-kicking ranchers come t’town.
Who’d’a’thunk trucks as a way to show off?
In fact, GMC says more than half of Sierra HD customers pick the Denali trim, which is the top model.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 GMC Sierra HD goes on sale later this summer in both 2500 and 3500, single rear wheel configurations. 3500 buyers can opt for dual rear wheels. Like the 1500-series trucks, the new HD will also get its own off-road oriented AT4 trim.

2019/01/25,2019 Mazda3: Two Flavors & Plenty of Extras,"The 2019 Mazda3 comes in two styles, sedan and hatchback.
A manual transmission is available in certain combinations.
The list of connectivity and safety features is impressive. 
Mazda keeps cranking these little guys out and it’s easy to see why. The Mazda3 is the best-selling car for the Japanese brand. I know, that’s kind of sad. I was hoping for the Miata, but it’s not a sports car world I’m afraid. So what makes the 2019 Mazda3 so hot? The usual stuff for Mazda: value and lots of goodies and fun.
Mazda might not be the most popular Japanese car brand, but they do hit a certain sweet spot. A spot where lots of innovation, high-end content, and driving fun meet for not much money.
Two Flavors, One Engine
The 2019 Mazda3 is a good example of this sweet spot. Starting at $21,000 in sedan skin, the 3 gets you a lot of car for not that much cash. There’s also a hatchback flavor that starts at $23,600. Regardless, both are propelled by the wonderful, race-derived SKYACTIV-G 2.5-liter engine. That engine cranks out 186 horsepower and 186 lb-ft. of torque, which is impressive, but not great (volumetrically speaking).
There’s paddle shifters for the six-speed automatic. But – and this is a big but – Mazda also has a six-speed manual transmission available for you old school gearheads out there. The manual is reserved for the front-wheel drive hatchbacks in Premium trim.
Related: The Bruno Mars of sports cars? Meet the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF.
All-Wheel Drive In The Mix
Front-wheel drive is standard, but Mazda’s predictive i-ACTIV all-wheel drive is available. No, I have no idea what “predictive i-ACTIV all-wheel drive” is, exactly, beyond more marketing speak gobbledygook. But I do know that having all four corners pawing at the pavement is (usually) a good thing. So good on Mazda for making that an affordable option.
The SKYACTIV engine uses cylinder-deactivation to lower fuel consumption when all you’re doing is cruising long distances down the highway. The new 3 also gets G-Vectoring Control Plus, Mazda’s torque vectoring scheme. 16-inch wheels are standard, with 18 inchers as an option.
Interior Treatments: Bang For Your Buck
Sadly, that’s about it for any performance-related news on the 2019 Mazda3. However, the other stuff, the interior and infotainment and all that, is where all the bang-for-your-buck is. The interior is entirely new for 2019 from the center console on up. Said console has a new shift knob and armrest for a more natural feeling for the driver. There’s a new 8.8-inch infotainment screen standard on all models. The “gauge cluster display” is now a seven-inch TFT reconfigurable screen.
RELATED

The eight-speaker sound system features a “three-way layout” with Bluetooth phone and audio pairing, HD radio, and two USB audio inputs. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also standard.
Comfort-wise you can expect leatherette seating surfaces, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and dual-zone climate control. Safety-wise there’s a host of standard features in Mazda’s i-ACTIVSENSE package: Driver Attention Alert, High Beam Control, Smart City Brake Support, Blind Spot Monitoring with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, and Lane Departure Warning just to name a few.
Did I mention the 2019 Mazda3 sedan starts at only $21k?
Three Extra Packages On Tap
There are three additional packages available for the 2019 Mazda3: Select, Preferred, and Premium. Depending on the package, you get even more neat stuff but it is model-specific. The sedan can come in all three but the hatchback only comes in Preferred and Premium. The Select package nets you everything we just talked about while the Preferred package comes with an upgraded Bose stereo. The Preferred also includes an eight-way power driver’s seat, power lumbar support, two-position driver memory, and heated front seats.
The Premium package gets a trick HUD setup called the Active Driving Display that projects onto the windshield. The Premium package also gets you leather seats, a power moonroof, and the Adaptive Front-Lighting System.
Pricing & Availability
So yes, you get a lot of stuff for, what should be, entry-level money. A complete pricing chart is below. Expect to see the 2019 Mazda3 at dealers in March.

2019/01/25,2020 Cadillac XT6: Enter The Goldilocks Zone,"The 2020 Cadillac XT6 is a three-row crossover with a laundry list of safety features.
Cadillac says “thoughtful technology integration” is central to the 2020 XT6.
It’s larger than the XT4 and XT5, but still smaller than a new Escalade.  
The 2020 Cadillac XT6 crossover/SUV had its global debut at this year’s Detroit Auto Show. And all I can say is you better get used to seeing a lot of these around. Not that Caddy was or ever will be a volume manufacturer, just that these SUV/crossover thingos are getting even more popular. The writing is on the wall: sedans are out. Nobody wants them any more and car companies are making less of them.
SUVs are in now. Everybody wants one and automakers can’t churn them out fast enough.
Spoonful of Porridge
The XT6 aims for the Goldilocks zone of being just right. Bigger than the more urban-oriented XT4, not as huge as the Escalade. And in that sweet spot, Caddy has packed in lots of bang for your buck. Although, this is a Cadillac, so it’s not exactly cheap. The XT6 is loaded down with enough gadgetry, comfort and convenience features, trick safety contraptions and such you will feel like you’re driving an actual Cadillac.
Let’s get the gearhead stuff – the important stuff – out of the way.
Power & Performance: From Six To Four
There are two basic trim levels: Premium Luxury and Sport. All-wheel drive is available on Premium Luxury and standard on XT6 Sport. Sport comes with Sport Control (naturally) which includes an active twin-clutch and yaw control within the AWD system. Sport models are also tricked out with Continuous Damping Control, an active handling scheme tied in with a faster steering ratio. This is all tuned to support a “more enthusiast-level driving feel, with increased feedback and greater overall responsiveness.”
Sure, whatever. The 2020 Cadillac XT6 still a big station wagon/truck.
All XT6s have a 3.6L DOHC V6 under the hood that puts out 310 horsepower. Said plant is mated to a nine-speed automatic. And, since GM still has a total Jones for fuel economy, there’s Active Fuel Management along for the ride. That kicks the engine into four-cylinder operation when V6 power is not needed. Slick!
Safety & Security: The Laundry List
The standard safety technologies read like a list of stuff you might think you have to pay extra for. HD Rear Vision Camera with Remote Wash, Forward Collision Alert, Following Distance Indicator, Automatic Emergency Braking, Front Pedestrian Braking, Front and Rear Park Assist, Lane Change Alert, and Side Blind Zone Alert. All standard.
RELATED

And the list goes on . . .
Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning, and the Safety Alert Seat feature; all included without even having to ask. If you do ask for more, the available Enhanced Visibility and Technology Package adds an eight-inch-diagonal color display, Rear Camera Mirror, Rear Camera Mirror Washer, HD Surround Vision, Surround Vision Recorder, Automatic Parking Assist with Braking, and finally, Rear Pedestrian Alert.
I love how it’s standard to worry about pedestrians in front your XT6. But if they’re behind you? Ah, that’ll cost ya extra, pal!
The available Driver Assist Package adds Adaptive Cruise Control – Advanced, Automatic Seat Belt Tightening, and Enhanced Automatic Emergency Braking. Night Vision is also available.
Spaceship Vibe
As far as connectivity goes, the 2020 Cadillac XT6 has more of that stuff than the Millennium Falcon. You can personalize the XT6 with user profiles which are stored in the Cloud. Drivers can access said custom profile in other GM vehicles with the same technology by the way.
Beyond that, there’s a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, NFC phone pairing, and wireless charging. USB ports? How’s ’bout six USB ports, two for each row of seats. The Cadillac Connected Access program (standard for 10 years) allows access to vehicle diagnostics and dealer maintenance notifications, among other features.
Related: An in-depth look at Cadillac’s Super Cruise system.
Interior Treatments: Premium Stereos & Heated Stuff
Let’s start with the tunage: Bose Performance Series sound system with 14 custom-tuned speakers. There’s a cabin air ionizer, heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats; even the second-row seats are heated. The third row is a power-folding job with a remote fold-down feature for the second-row seat t’boot. Wood finishes like Black Olive Ash are available, or there’s a Carbon Fiber trim with ombré finish if you prefer.
Pricing & Availability
Cadillac is currently accepting orders for the XT6. The Premium Luxury front-wheel drive model starts at $53,690, while the all-wheel drive XT6 Sport starts at $58,090. Both figures include destination and handling charges.

2019/01/24,NAIAS 2019: The Most Exciting Reveals & Looking Ahead,"The 2019 North American International Auto Show enters its final weekend in Detroit.
Here is a look at the most exciting reveals and a few predictions for the future of the show.
The 2019 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) is often considered the premier event of the automotive industry’s show season. As usual, it was full of exciting new models, innovative technology, and manufacturer announcements. However, this year’s show also left the industry with some questions as NAIAS faces big changes over the next few years.
By now, you’ve likely heard that this year’s show was the last to be held in January.
Setting The Stage
In 2020, NAIAS will take place in June. There are several factors involved in this decision, one of the most heavily-discussed being the show’s timing in relation to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. For several years, these two shows have occurred nearly back-to-back. And CES has become a popular event for showcasing the latest in automotive technology.
Recently, we’ve seen major automakers spend time and resources on concept vehicles and autonomous technology to be unveiled at CES. These decisions may lead them to skip NAIAS entirely. This year, there was almost as much talk about the brands that didn’t attend NAIAS, like Mercedes Benz, Audi, and BMW, as there was about new vehicle reveals.
However, looking beyond the impact of CES, there are other practical reasons for moving the show to a new time of year. Overall, we’ve seen brands become more selective about auto shows. Going to Detroit, New York, and Chicago during a three-to-four-month period can be an expensive undertaking. Holding the show in June gives automakers time to breathe if they choose to attend CES or other regional auto shows. It also opens up additional opportunities for promoting new models.
Before we get to that and other predictions for 2020 and beyond, let’s discuss what we saw in Detroit this winter.
NAIAS 2019 Highlights: Future Tech & Everyday Cars
This year, NAIAS can almost be considered an “anti-CES” for several reasons. The biggest of these might be a greater focus on practical features and vehicle trends that both enthusiasts and average drivers alike are looking for, and actually able to purchase. As exciting as it is to learn about futuristic concepts – like applications of virtual reality – it will likely be a while before consumers adapt these technologies in their cars.
To that end, NAIAS has always taken pride in how the show’s focus is cars, trucks, and SUVs.

Yes, in recent years this has come to include innovative technology like passive safety features and infotainment systems. However, for the most part, what you’re seeing on the floor is available to purchase in the coming months. With this in mind, it’s not surprising the trends we’ve seen across the industry and in dealer showrooms over the past year showing up big at NAIAS.
Once again, this meant a strong showing of trucks, SUVs, and crossovers, all of which have ruled the past few years. But there were exceptions.
NAIAS 2019 Highlights: Most Exciting Reveals
Perhaps surprisingly, this year we also saw a number of new sporty cars and sedans make a splash. This might indicate that this class hasn’t been completely buried by larger SUVs and/or abandoned by automakers as many industry experts believe to be the case.
Here’s a brief list of what grabbed industry and consumer attention this year:
2020 Toyota Supra: This year’s show brought the return of the fabled Supra sports car. This iteration shares its platform and mechanicals with the BMW Z4.
2019 Ram Heavy Duty: The Cummins diesel engine provides an incredible 1,000 lb-ft. of torque. And it can tow 35,000 lbs. A great example of the unstoppable momentum of high-output vehicles these days.
2020 Mustang Shelby GT500: This was highly-anticipated and is one of the few “cars” remaining in FoMoCo’s lineup. Also worth mentioning: it has over 700 horsepower!
2020 Cadillac XT6: This is now Cadillac’s largest crossover, taking its place alongside the XT4 and XT5. (The Escalade, another large offering that may come to mind, is actually a full-size body-on-frame SUV).
2020 Ford Explorer: This important SUV in Ford’s line reverts to a new rear-wheel drive platform.
2020 Kia Telluride: Kia is attempting to move upmarket with this new large crossover.
2020 VW Passat: We might be seeing fewer sedans across the board, but the new Passat is completely redesigned and now represents VW’s largest sedan offering.
North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards
Car of the Year: Genesis G70. Genesis is a luxury brand owned by Hyundai. This model offers serious competition to other luxury sedans, particularly in a class said to be suffering as more drivers are enticed by crossovers.
Utility of the Year: Hyundai Kona (and another big win for them). The Kona comes with a traditional gasoline engine or as an EV. The EV option is being touted by industry experts as one of the most-accessible, mass-market electric options available currently.

Truck of the Year: Ram 1500. The truck’s comfort and convenience features have become almost as important as its power, torque, and towing figures.
Predictions For 2020: Warmer Temps & New Opportunities
As I mentioned, moving NAIAS to June has the potential to create new opportunities for automakers and revitalize the auto show in Detroit. Industry experts and enthusiasts love to complain about travelling to Detroit in January for the show, so the change of season, while it may seem trivial, might help draw larger crowds. The warmer weather means that brands can more readily take advantage of available outdoor space, creating an opportunity for them to expand their displays.
Additionally, many new model-year vehicles are launched in late summer. Having the show take place shortly before the new car season might push more automakers to have a strong presence at NAIAS next year. This timing will create a larger opportunity to introduce consumers to new offerings that will be entering showrooms soon after the show.
In the long run, this could be beneficial for sales and the industry as a whole.
Predictions For 2020: More Focus On Cars (Concept Or Otherwise)
Giving a cushion of time between CES and NAIAS might also result in more concept vehicles and innovative technology features for the Detroit show. However, as the show remains an industry event, rather than a destination for the most buzz-worthy tech, I think it’s a safe bet that the focus will remain on cars that consumers can purchase and drive in the near future, regardless of when the show takes place and which brands choose to exhibit there.

2019/01/21,2020 Kia Telluride: The South Korean Range Rover,"2020 Kia Telluride debuts at the North American International Auto Show.
The Telluride is a luxurious and rugged family SUV with seating for eight.
The 3.8-liter GDI V6 motor can tow 5,000 lbs. All-wheel drive is available.
Well, look what we have here. The 2020 Kia Telluride. I and the rest of the guys here at Automoblog got our first glimpse of the Telluride during the 2018 New York Fashion Week. It graced Brandon Maxwell’s Texas-inspired fashion collection, so it naturally came with rugged accoutrements like a hatch-mounted spare tire and snorkel.
Sadly, that particular Telluride is a one-off version.
Back then, the Kia Telluride had impressive credentials. My first impression was that of a large, luxurious family SUV with true off-road credentials. From this alone, Kia has struck the nail right on the head.
Huge Market Potential
Currently, both import and domestic carmakers are scrambling for position. The plan is to release as many sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks as possible, two of the best-selling vehicles globally.
Kia – along with parent company Hyundai – made the right choice in conceptualizing a large SUV. They didn’t want to settle for a one-trick-pony crossover. And as Hyundai is presenting the Palisade as a refined type of behemoth, Kia went the other way around with the Telluride. Think Rob Gronkowski instead of Tom Brady and you’re not far off.
Here is a rugged SUV that can hack it over rougher roads and uneven pavement. But it also offers a level of safety tech and luxury that rivals premium offerings like the Range Rover Discovery and Audi Q7.
Direct-Injected Power
Kia equipped the new Telluride with a 3.8-liter gasoline V6 with direct injection. It is good for 291 horsepower and 262 lb-ft. of torque. Power is fed to the front wheels via an eight-speed automatic, but the Telluride is available with an active on-demand all-wheel drive system.
Interestingly enough, the Hyundai Palisade is also equipped with the very same motor as the Telluride.
The 2020 Kia Telluride comes with four drive modes: Smart, Eco, Sport, and Comfort. Each setting will feed electrons to the steering, powertrain, and drivetrain accordingly. The new Telluride can tow up to 5,000 lbs., which is just about right for a luxury-based SUV.
Rugged & Muscular Styling
Compared to the Telluride concept car, the production model is a bit shorter and smaller. Kia also gave the new Telluride a more squared-off look. This helps to further differentiate the Telluride from the Hyundai Palisade.
RELATED

And even though the Palisade and Telluride are based on the same platform, Kia is quick to point out that both vehicles share zero exterior panels. Viewed from the side, the rounded fenders and large alloys command attention. There’s no doubt the Telluride is a looker, which is a nice thing to have in a hulking SUV.
With a long, broad hood and wide front grille, the new Telluride exudes a rugged elegance. The stacked headlights and upright windshield convey power, authority, and modernity. Further enhancing the go-anywhere appeal are the Telluride badges on the hood and liftgate. The rear is adorned with inverted L-shaped taillights with LED stripes and a sculpted rear skid plate.
The 2020 Kia Telluride is also equipped with twin exhaust tips. Thankfully, they’re not the fake kind.
Epicurean Interior
Kia utilized all the tricks in the book to come up with a luxurious and plush interior, but the Hyundai Palisade is more high-tech with its push-button shifter and larger 12-inch touchscreen. Despite this fact, Kia didn’t skimp on soft-touch materials, sumptuous leather, and comfortable seats. As a result, the Telluride’s interior is a nice place to be.
Most importantly, it offers generous interior room to move around. In fact, the cabin is roomy enough to accommodate eight adults.
The interior is bathed in matte-finished wood and brushed metal trimming. The tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel is wrapped in cowhide. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard along with Bluetooth connectivity and a remote-start. Higher trim models receive Kia’s UVO telematics system. This allows you to monitor and control vehicle settings using your smartphone or laptop.
Advanced Safety
The 2020 Kia Telluride comes standard with anti lock braking, stability control, stability management, downhill brake control, hill-start assist, and a tire pressure monitoring system. The Kia Drive Wise system includes forward collision warning, collision avoidance, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, blind spot monitoring, and smart cruise control among others.
Pricing & Availability
Assembly for the 2020 Kia Telluride is at the Georgia West Point plant. The base Telluride LX starts at $31,690 and comes with middle bench seats, leatherette seat trim, and smart key with push button start. The S trim starts at $33,990 and can be optioned with captain’s chairs in the second row. Also included are heated front seats, a power sunroof, and 20-inch wheels.

2019/01/19,Supra Vs. Z4: The Fine Line Between Toyota & BMW Sports Cars,"The 2020 Toyota Supra is destined for greatness. But there’s a problem.
The BMW Z4 M40i is basically the same car albeit with a more powerful motor.
Which begs the question: when is a Toyota sports car not a BMW?
Where does one end and the other begin?
The much anticipated hype is over. In the immortal words of my colleague Tony Borroz, it’s time to stop frothing at the mouth since the 2020 Toyota Supra is finally here. And boy, what a journey it has been, huh? I’m pretty sure Toyota did everything possible to make the fifth-generation Supra a great car.
I must admit, the omission of a proper manual transmission is a heretical sin. But until a proper test drive is in place, I’ll allow the standard ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic to bask in the limelight. For now.
Carrying The Weight of The Car World
Younger generations might not realize, but the 2020 Toyota Supra is carrying a huge burden. Us older enthusiasts know the previous-gen A80 Toyota Supra is a legend, further bolstered by the popularity of The Fast and the Furious franchise. Which only means the new Supra has some huge shoes to fill. I bet it was feeling a bit nervous as the cover came off at the 2019 North American International Auto Show. Here’s a car not any bigger than the GT86, yet slated to be more popular than Toyota’s halo car, the Lexus LFA.
In my mind, it’s not exactly a big deal since the 2020 Toyota Supra is engineered with the right ingredients. It can easily become a great sports car. I mean, with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, rear-wheel drive, and a limited-slip differential, all the bases are practically covered.
But what I can’t get off my mind is how the Supra is remarkably similar to the 2019 BMW Z4.
[bctt tweet=”To answer the question outright, a #Toyota sports car is not a #BMW if it performs and feels like a proper #Supra.” username=”Automoblog”]
Same Car, Different Story
And if you’ve been reading about the new Z4, you probably know by now how it and the Supra are basically the same. We’ve all heard this before, right? The aforementioned Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ are the same car, much in the same way the Fiat 124 Spider is no different from the current-gen Mazda MX-5.
But unlike the Fiat and the Mazda that came with different engines (albeit with similar mechanicals), Toyota played it safe with the new Supra; similar to when they collaborated with Subaru in creating the 86/BRZ/FR-S.
Power Is Not Everything? Right?
Yes, but only if we’re talking about humdrum mini compacts or generic family sedans. When it comes to a new Toyota sports car bearing the Supra name, then no. Power IS everything! Especially in this day and age of ludicrously swift electric vehicles.

In order to prove this, let’s examine the Supra’s superstar predecessor: the A80 Toyota Supra. The A80 is motivated by the mighty 2JZ-GTE, which cranked out 326 horsepower courtesy of sequential turbocharging. Back in the day, it had more power than the Porsche 911 Turbo 3.6 and the E36 BMW M3.
And after 21 years of waiting, what do we get in the new Toyota Supra? 335 horsepower and 365 lb-ft. of torque. Looks impressive, right? Not until you find out how the 2019 BMW Z4 M40i churns out 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque from the same inline-six.
Turning The Tables
We were talking about the return of a legend? Right? So why is the new Toyota Supra down in power versus the BMW Z4? This is more difficult to understand when you’re expecting the new Supra to be faster, more focused, more exciting, and brasher than the old model.
Sure, the lack in power can be remedied by bolting on a couple of go-fast engine parts, but what’s the point? Where I’m expecting the BMW Z4 to be the cruiser and grand tourer of the duo, it came out to be the athlete. The BMW Z4 M40i scoots to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds, while the Supra completes the job in 4.1 seconds. And this is despite the Toyota being a hardtop coupe.
[bctt tweet=”Where I’m expecting the #BMW Z4 to be the cruiser and grand tourer of the duo, it came out to be the athlete. ” username=”Automoblog”]
And The Styling, Oh The Styling!
The 2020 Toyota Supra is not a bad looking car. But it’s not exactly a looker, either. I didn’t appreciate the styling of the new Z4 when it came out. But now that the cat is out of the bag for the Supra, I’m beginning to think the BMW is better looking for the intended purpose. I know beauty relies on the eyes of the beholder, and some folks might find the comical grin of the Z4 to be polarizing to say the least.
Viewed from the rear, the new Toyota Supra looks fine, but the BMW has a better rump in my book. If only Toyota was kind enough to retain the front styling of the FT-1 Concept for the new Supra, things could be different now.
On a brighter note, the new Supra inherited some of the brilliant design elements of the FT-1 Concept, like the double-bubble roof and upward sweeping line that forms the bulbous and aggressive rear haunches. I’m not sure how difficult it is to turn a concept car into reality. But if Mazda can do it with the new 3 (which thankfully looks pretty similar to the Kai Concept), why not Toyota with the Supra?

[bctt tweet=”Here I am expecting a wider, more aggressive, and larger sports car than the #Toyota 86. I definitely need to curb my expectations the next time around.” username=”Automoblog”]
Did The Z4 & The Supra Really Have To Be The Same?
Well, they’re not exactly that identical. The Supra is a smidgen longer at 172.44 inches compared to the BMW Z4, which has an overall length of 170.2 inches.
However, the Z4 is 10 millimeters wider than the Supra, and I find this surprising. Imagine my eureka moment when I found out the new Supra is not any longer or bigger than the smaller, softer, and less-focused GT86. And the 86 is a 2+2 coupe while the Supra is strictly a two-seater. Here I am expecting a wider, more aggressive, and larger sports car than the Toyota 86.
I definitely need to curb my expectations the next time around.
Based on initial impressions, you will think you’re sitting inside a BMW as you rest your bottom on the driver’s seat of the new Supra. If not for the Toyota badge on the steering wheel and some dashboard switchgear, the car would be talking to you in a thick German accent.
When Is A Toyota Sports Car Not A BMW?
To answer the question outright, a Toyota sports car is not a BMW if it performs and feels like a proper Supra. Toyota claims the torque output of the new Supra is available from low rpms, and the gear ratios of the ZF eight-speed are close enough for an exciting driving experience. Is this enough to mask the sensation of having less power than the Z4?
Only time will tell.
I was expecting nothing less than a significantly detuned version of the Lexus LFA for the 2020 Toyota Supra. We’ll see if Toyota did enough to make the Supra a more hardcore and focused version of the BMW Z4, which it is supposed to be in the first place.

2019/01/18,2019 BMW Z4: Turbo 4s & Straight 6s All Day,"The 2019 BMW Z4 features two new engines, one of which is nearly 400 horsepower. 
With a 50:50 weight distribution, curb weight comes in at 3,443 lbs.; GVW is 4,092 lbs.
The electrically-operated soft top can be opened in ten seconds at speeds up to 31 mph.
BMW is touting their latest Z4 roadster, fitting since it shares a lot of bits and pieces with the current show-stealer, Toyota’s new Supra. As hot and anticipated as that Supra is, it is best not to overlook what BMW is doing. It’s never a good idea to underestimate or overlook BMW.
Continued styling mistakes aside, they still make some of the hottest cars around.
Two Rights, No Wrongs
So, given that both the Z4 and the Supra will cost about the same (around $50k) the choice is up to you whether you’d like a German convertible or a Japanese coupe. Styling is a subjective matter, but it’s really hard to say that choosing one over the other would be “wrong.” How could buying a nearly 400 horsepower convertible be wrong?
Yes, like the “M” in BMW, the Z4 is all about dat motor baby!
Turbo 4s & Straight 6s
The 2019 BMW Z4 has a choice of two plants: a not-all-that-bad turbo four cylinder and a much more interesting straight-six that makes big power. The four-banger is a 2.0-liter TwinPower Turbocharged motor, getting a bump of 15 horsepower and 35 lb-ft. of torque over its predecessor. The 2.0-liter engine is now good enough for 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque.
Bottom line, sprint-wise? Zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds. Like I said, not all that bad.
Related: The fine line between Toyota and BMW sports cars.
The Other Sister
The other engine, the one you should be paying attention to (i.e. the gearhead engine), is a 3.0-liter straight-six said to have an appetite for revs. The six is up 47 horsepower over the outgoing mill and features a slew of cool tech. There’s a water-cooled exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, for example; plus a quicker-responding turbocharger and direct injection.
Bottom line for this engine: 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of peak torque. 60 mph comes up in just 3.9 seconds. This thing must be a blast on an AutoX course or a twisty mountain road!
Transmission Tech: Sportier & Snappier
Either engine comes bolted to a standard eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission with steering wheel shift paddles. These BMW trannys are really great these days, rivaling the overall quality and feel of the engines they’re mated to. Which is even more impressive when you realize this isn’t a semi-auto box either, but, in actuality, an automatic transmission that behaves (nearly) like a full manual.
RELATED

Anyhoo, the current transmission has a wider ratio spread for sportier shifts and snappier acceleration. There’s also a transmission Launch Control (for even more fun from a standing start). BMW has tweaked the transmission a little bit more in the Z4 M40i with M-specific shift characteristics to complement the straight-six engine’s power delivery.
Essential Foundations: Chassis & Suspension
The proportions have grown for the new Z4 in every area. It’s 3.3 inches longer, 2.9 inches wider, and 0.5 inches taller than its predecessor. The wheelbase drops by an inch but the tracks are wider (+3.86 inches in front and +2.45 inches in the rear). BMW rightfully says the 50:50 weight distribution enhances the new Z4’s agility.
Incidentally, the 2019 BMW Z4 utilizes a double-joint spring strut suspension in the front, and a new five-link rear suspension, a first for a BMW Roadster. The front suspension sub frame and control arm mounting points are more rigid, while the aluminum control arms and swivel bearings reduce unsprung weight. Out back, the rear suspension benefits from an aluminum and steel design.
Related: Stand on it Stroker Ace! Another look at the 2019 BMW Z4.
Overall, the chassis of the Z4 is light, tight, and handles right, and is complimented by a smorgasbord of digital nannies. These helpmates and overseers ensure you don’t make a complete fool of yourself. If the Dynamic Stability Control, Dynamic Traction Control, Cornering Brake Control, Dynamic Brake Control, (oh and ABS) can’t keep you out of trouble, then I dunno what to say t’you son.
Maybe take the bus.
2020 BMW Z4 M40i Roadster
Naturally, there are even more goodies to be found on the Z4 M40i Roadster. There’s a chassis/drivetrain control system that comes in three modes. The Adaptive M Sport suspension features a 10 mm lower ride height and includes electronically-controlled dampers.
The M Sport rear differential, also electronically-controlled, sharpens that sporting edge further. The diff lock is controlled via an electric motor and equalizes torque distribution between the rear wheels. The idea is greater control through corners while reducing understeer and oversteer.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 BMW Z4 comes in eight exterior colors, while the soft-top roof comes in black (standard) or Anthracite with silver effect as an option. The new Z4 Roadster starts at $49,700 for the sDrive30i, and $63,700 for the sDrive M40i. That’s not bad; more than a Miata, but less than a Corvette convertible. It’d be hard to pass this one by.

2019/01/18,2020 Mustang Shelby GT500: One Slick Snake,"2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 debuts at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
Capable of mid-three-second zero to 60 times and sub-11-second quarter-mile scores, says Ford.
Aerodynamics, downforce, and race-tuning the chassis were among the priorities during development.
Ford drove all the way over to Detroit from Dearborn the other day, and decided to show off this: The 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500. It’s about what you’d expect. Big, mean, capable, lots of bang for your buck, (but still kind of expensive) and – here’s the best part: It’s the most powerful Ford ever. Yes. Ever.
No, dumb-dumb, that does not include race cars. We’re talking production cars here, but, at more than 700 horsepower, it might as well include a few. For example, that’s more than what David Pearson’s Torino was making back in the stock car days.
Engine & Transmission: Inverted In The Valley
Overall, the 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 features the most powerful street-legal Ford engine to date. It also has the quickest-shifting transmission ever in a Mustang. First, the plant making all that power is a hand-built, aluminum alloy 5.2-liter supercharged affair. The force-feeding is handled by an inverted, 2.65-liter roots-type supercharger that runs through an air-to-liquid intercooler tucked cleverly in the valley of the V8.
Ford flipped the blower itself to further lower the center of gravity.
They made the lump as light as they practically could too. Aluminum alloy block, wire-arc cylinder liners, high-flow aluminum cylinder heads, and larger forged connecting rods. They upped the lubrication and cooling passages, even adding a “structural oil pan.” Ford tossed in a patented “active baffle system” to keep oil where it’s needed for good measure.
Ford Performance went with a TREMEC seven-speed dual-clutch transmission that shifts in under 100 milliseconds. Deal with it you manual gearbox diehards. The transmission has a number of “drive modes” like normal, weather, sport, swanky, and drag and track. The modes kick on features like line-lock and launch control. South from there, the power runs through a carbon fiber driveshaft.
Chassis & Braking: Brembos & Michelins
The new Shelby GT500 gets revised suspension geometry, a new electronic power steering unit, and lighter coil springs front and rear. And praise Henry, they remembered brakes and tires, Brembos and Michelins, specifically.
The stoppers are pizza-sized 16.5-inch (420-millimeter) two-piece rotors, the biggest on any domestic sports coupe, according to Ford. They are clamped by larger and stiffer Brembo six-piston calipers. With 20 percent more swept area than the Shelby GT350’s, these Brembos have more than 30 percent additional thermal mass in the front corners. Those skins are Ford Performance-spec Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Replacing them will probably bankrupt you.
Related: Although not a Shelby, don’t ignore the “normal” Mustang GT. It’s fast and fun, and the exhaust system will wake the neighbors. Here is our full review.

Handling Packages: Two Choices For Fans
There are two handling packages on tap. The first is simply dubbed “Handling Package,” which includes adjustable strut top mounts and a spoiler with a Gurney flap. The “Carbon Fiber Track Package” (knock it off with the crazy name, ya kids!) features exposed 20-inch carbon fiber wheels, with the rears clocking in at a possum-squishing 11.5-inches wide.
The Carbon Fiber Track Package includes Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, an upgrade over the 4S tires. Also making things better for the track is the adjustable and exposed, carbon fiber GT4 wing and splitter wickers with integrated dive planes.
Exterior Design: Mean But Functional
Ford says the overall look is a “functional, menacing design tuned with Ford Performance know-how.” I’m not going to disagree with them, because this thing does look like it’d bite your head off man. There’s gaping openings and venturi ducts, kicks, flips, lines, creases, scars and whatnot all over the place. Subtle, it is not. But if you want to scream what a badass you are, this is a good way to do it.
Backing it up is your problem, as is growing old with class.
Development of the 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 took place at Ford’s technical center in North Carolina, where engineers spent time in the windshear rolling wind tunnel to perfect the design. As a result, the front fascia openings are more than doubled versus the Shelby GT350, while six heat exchangers increase cooling pack airflow by more than 50 percent. Further, a 31×28-inch louvered hood vent features a removable aluminum rain tray for better air extraction and increased downforce.
Interior Treatments: Carbon Fiber & Recaro Seats
The interior is much the same as the outside. Exposed carbon fiber instrument panel appliqué (cheap!) and door panel inserts in Dark Slate Miko suede with accent stitching. Recaro racing seats with side bolstering and safety harness pass-throughs are available. There’s a 12-inch, full-color LCD instrument cluster and 12-speaker B&O Play audio system.
The rear seat is deleted to reduce weight. As it should be.
Pricing & Availability
All this should be sitting in FoMoCo dealers by this fall in a host of new colors including Red Hot, Twister Orange, and Iconic Silver. Painted go-fast stripes are also available! Ford has not disclosed pricing as of this writing.

2019/01/17,2020 VW Passat: Now With “Tornado” Lines,"The 2020 VW Passat strikes a balance between new technology and proven performance. 
VW says the new Passat’s design is coupe-like with a “tornado line” running through the car.  
The 2020 VW Passat is the very definition of a good run-around car. These are cars we buy for driving to work; or for our spouses or kids as they go off to college. We feel relieved when we, or someone we love, is behind the wheel of a good run-around car.
We don’t break the bank with the 2020 VW Passat, but we get enough for the commute. In a world where SUVs dominate and car lines are getting the boot, the 2020 Passat is a nice alternative for those who still want a “normal” sedan.
Let’s take a look.
Interior Treatments: For American Tastes
On the inside is where it really matters for the 2020 VW Passat. Eight years ago, VW spent considerable time redesigning the Passat for American buyers. Interior space, technology, and creature comforts topped the list. For 2020, this means a more contemporary instrument panel and a new glass-covered touchscreen. Every 2020 Passat comes with VW’s Car-Net technology, which integrates Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and MirrorLink.
Three interior décor designs are available, based on trim, as are V-Tex leatherette and Nappa leather seating. Heated front and rear seats (with memory) and dual-zone climate controls are optional. Available convenience features include power-folding, heated side mirrors (also with memory), auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote start, and rain-sensing wipers.
Top trim models have a Fender Premium Audio system, which will make any long commute enjoyable.
Styling & Design: The “Tornado” Line
The 2020 Passat retains the underpinnings of the previous model but the exterior is quite different. The grille, LED headlights and taillights, and badging are new, for example. VW makes note of the “dramatic tornado line” on the 2020 Passat, but don’t elaborate. VW alludes to the “coupe-like” profile, so maybe that’s it? Or perhaps that tornado line is referring to the actual roofline?
We’re not entirely sure, although it sounds cool, whatever it is and wherever it’s at.
Related: Good value for the money? Our full review of the 2019 VW Jetta.
Platform & Chassis: Carried Over From 2019
The technical aspects include a front suspension with damper struts, robust lower control arms, coil springs, and an anti-roll bar. At the rear, the four-link independent layout marries telescopic dampers and another anti-roll bar. The electro-mechanical power steering provides a healthy balance, making the 2020 Passat easier to control at all speeds.
17-inch wheels come standard, although more stylish 18- and 19-inch wheels are available.
How Much Horsepower Does The 2020 Passat Have?
The 2020 VW Passat makes 174 horsepower from its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine with direct injection. With the new torque converter and corresponding software, torque output rises to 207 lb-ft. from 184. Power is sent to the front wheels via a six-speed automatic with Tiptronic. It’s not the most powerful thing in the world, but considering it’s an ideal run-around-town kind of car, the engine specs are plenty good.
No word on fuel economy yet, although the 2019 Passat comes in at 25/36 city/highway and 29 combined.
Safety & Security
As is the trend with vehicles today, the 2020 VW Passat loads up on active safety tech. Every Passat includes Forward Collision Warning, Autonomous Emergency Braking, Pedestrian Monitoring, and a Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Traffic Alert. Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Assist help on the open road, while Park Assist is handy for the garage downtown.
Pricing & Availability
The entry-level VW Passat S starts at $23,915 after the destination fee of $920. A more complete look at the trim levels and pricing for the 2020 Passat can be found here. The Volkswagen Chattanooga assembly plant has production honors.

2019/01/16,"2019 Subaru STI S209: Small, Powerful & Rare","The Subaru STI S209 debuts at the North American International Auto Show.
Flexible strut tower bar, Brembo brakes, and a powerful engine are among the highlights.  
First STI-crafted S-line performance vehicle set for the United States, although numbers are limited.
Oh baby! Here’s a tasty piece of automotive engineering: The Subaru WRX STi S209. Wait, scratch that. It is simply called the STi S209, or the 2019 Subaru Limited-Edition STI S209 if you want to be technical about it. But essentially it’s a big, fast WRX that will force your eyeballs back into your skull like a punch from Jackie Chan.
And, given the inherent goodness of the Subie’s always-on all-wheel-drive system, you can use the S209 all the time in any weather.
Small & Powerful
One could say – and I’m one that would – that the main gift Fuji Heavy Industries bestows upon the STI S209 is in the engine bay. That being 341 horsepower. That is a lot, by any measurement and, in a car this (relatively) small and light, that is a lot (a lot!) of power. Sure, the STI S209 has more going for it, but that number will be the only argument any number of potential buyers will need to hear. Potential buyers like any number of friends of mine in rally clubs spread across the USA.
So, besides the engine, what does the STI S209 have to offer? There are upgrades across the board. Upgrades in handling, aerodynamics, and driver engagement. The rally car also sports front, rear and side under spoilers, front bumper canards, and a carbon-fiber roof panel and rear wing.
Here is a look.
Fender Flares & Brembo Brakes
For starters, the STI S209 now stands 1.7 inches wider than a standard WRX STI, clocking in at 72.4 inches overall. Like the WRX STI Nürburgring Challenge racecar that inspired it, the STI S209 has “expanded wide-body” exterior treatments. Fender flares for you old school types out there. Those flares are there to contain a wider front and rear track, the 19 x 9-inch forged BBS alloy wheels, and those big whopping 265/35 Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT600A summer-only tires.
And please note those are summer-only. So you gravel racers will have to get your own shoes for rally purposes.
The big vents on the front fenders are there for additional engine cooling, while vents on the rear fenders correct air turbulence and reduce drag. Wanna stop? Course you do. Mash that center pedal and the Brembo brakes, with cross-drilled steel rotors and six-piston monoblock front calipers and two-piston monoblock rear calipers, will haul you down like the Incredible Hulk grabbed you by the trunk.

Porsche 718 Boxster & Cayman GTS Get Slick New 4.0-Liter Engine!
The upgraded high-friction pads bring improved fade-resistance to the party.
Essential Foundations: Flexible Versus Rigid
Specially-developed Bilstein shocks, stiffened coil springs, a 20mm rear stabilizer bar, and pillow-type bushings for the front and rear lateral links keep every corner under control. The chassis of the STI S209 is stiffer thanks to the front crossmember and rear subframes, although the front-strut tower bar and the front/rear draw stiffeners are flexible. Bear with me for a sec.
A flexible bar, unlike the usual rigid bar, is split and joined with a pillow ball joint in the center. This makes it longitudinally mobile while helping to laterally stiffen things up. Bottom line: optimal tire grip during lateral moments and a compliant ride during longitudinal moments. The draw stiffeners are there to apply tension between the body and crossmember for optimized chassis flex, upping stability while cornering. And all the while providing better ride, handling, and steering response. Slick!
Now, about all that power . . .
Inside The Engine Bay
Subie reworked the snot out of the EJ25 2.5-liter turbocharged boxer plant! For example, midrange torque gets a 10 percent bump at 3,600 rpm, so corner exits are higher. The STI turbocharger, manufactured by HKS, features a larger turbine and compressor for 18.0 psi of boost. The pistons are forged and the con rods are lighter and stronger. Other improvements include a new high-flow fuel pump, silicone turbo inlet duct, larger fuel injectors, an intercooler water spray system, and an STI-tuned engine control module.
There’s a serial number plate proudly displayed on the engine block. If that’s not enough, the mufflers deliver 17 percent less airflow resistance.
Transmission Tech & Drive Modes
The engine is paired with a close-ratio, six-speed manual transmission and Subaru’s famous Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system. Duh. Front/rear limited-slip differentials, natch. The Driver Controlled Center Differential, Active Torque Vectoring, and the Multi-Mode Vehicle Dynamics Control system are also along for the ride.
The recalibrated SI-Drive system offers three modes: Intelligent (I) for better fuel economy and smoother power control; Sport (S) for balance between response and control; and Sport Sharp (S#) for the best acceleration times.

2019/01/15,2020 Toyota Supra: It’s Finally Here!,"The 2020 Toyota Supra debuts at the North American International Auto Show.
After a long wait – 21 years in fact – Supra fans finally receive their unicorn.
Zero to 60 times are solid and the chassis setup is impressive.    
Okay, just calm down, calm down I say! The 2020 Toyota Supra is here. You will get your chance to bask in its glory, including tons of specs and performance numbers, in due time, but until then, you are going to have to calm down. You have been frothing at the mouth for this thing ever since . . . well, ever since the last one disappeared over 20 years ago.
And now it’s here.
Whispers In The Wind
There has been a racket all over the automotive world for more than a year now. First it was there might be a new Supra from Toyota. Then it was there will be a new Supra. Last year, Toyota teased us with a GR Supra Racing Concept. Then more and more details leaked (included a tasty partnership between Toyota and BMW), and now, here we are.
It was worth the wait.
Power & Performance: Torque On The Low End
The upcoming fifth generation Supra was developed by Toyota and GAZOO racing, the guys that won Le Mans last year and have Fernando Alonso as one of their drivers. And, as everyone hoped, it’s chock full of performance goodies, high-tech or otherwise.
The 2020 Toyota Supra is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline six, kicking out 335 horsepower and 365 lb-ft. of torque. Good numbers. Great numbers, actually, given the displacement of the engine and the not-really-big size of the car itself. ‘Yota says thanks to the arrangement of the twin-scroll turbocharger, direct fuel injection, and the intake and exhaust camshaft’s (continuously variable) timing, the bulk of that torque comes on from low engine speeds. Huzzah!
Transmission Tech: Automatics Only
The mill is bolted to an eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters, giving manual control when desired. However, there is no manual option. Sorry. No. None. Yes, yes I know. And I have not heard if Toyota hearkens to your lamentations. You will have to make do with a slush-box, although it is one of those nice modern ones that brings quick shifts to the table. It’s about as close as you can get to a true double-clutch auto-manual.
I can understand this. Adding a semi-auto would have tacked on another ten grand to the price (I bet). The ratios within the eight-speed auto-box are said to be short (no hard numbers given) for the lower gears and, thanks to a Launch Control system, you get strong acceleration and traction out of the gate. Toyota says 60 mph comes up in 4.1 seconds. The whole shootin’ match tops out at an electronically-limited 155 mph. There must be a way to top that, but I’ll leave that up to the aftermarket.

2020 Toyota Supra Measurement
Preliminary Specs *Inches unless otherwise noted
Zero to 60 4.1 Seconds
Curb Weight 3,397 lbs.
Wheelbase 97.2
Overall Width 73.0
Overall Height 50.9
Overall Length 172.5
Track Width (Front) 62.8
Track Width (Rear) 62.6
Higher Speeds, Lower Track Times
The 2020 Toyota Supra comes with two driving modes: Normal and Sport. Sport is all about on-track capability and keeping standard computer nannies like traction and stability control out of your way as the driver. Sport Mode also improves throttle response and increases steering weight, while providing snappier shifts and more aggressive active differential tuning. Oh, and Sport Mode amplifies the exhaust sound. Who cares what your neighbors think!
Here’s all you need to know about Normal Mode: Nothing. Toyota tells us absolutely zip, zero, nada, about Normal Mode. If it’s that unimportant, then why should I care? It’s probably just like driving a Corolla.
Did I say “active differential?” Why yes, yes I did! If you have already screwed around with a car with an active differential, then you will need no convincing that they are a thing of wonderment. The new Supra should turn-in like a snake. Toyota has set it up so an electric motor and multi-plate clutches within the diff control lateral torque. And, as you would expect, this active diff controls torque distribution while cornering.
End result: Greater momentum through a corner, higher speeds, and lower track times.
Essential Foundations: Supra’s Chassis & Structure
The chassis is a classic setup, with structural rigidity, a low center of gravity, and 50:50 weight distribution among the focal points. There’s heavy steel bracing throughout. In fact, nine areas of the rear structure were identified as points to reinforce, which ultimately increase the Supra’s rigidity and neutral balance.
From there, Toyota specified the tuning for the new, double-joint spring strut front and multi-link rear suspension. Further, Toyota says the front subframe and control arm mounting points increase rigidity, while the aluminum control arms reduce unsprung weight. Standard is an Adaptive Variable Suspension system that immediately adjusts damping in response to driver input and road conditions.
The electric power steering is variable-assist, variable-ratio, and sport-tuned for precise handling.
Standard 19-inch forged alloy wheels include 255/35R19 tires up front, and 275/35R19 meats in the back. Said tires are Michelin Pilot Super Sports. Whoaing all this up comes by way of four-piston Brembo calipers, clamping on 13.7-inch rotors at the front.

2019/01/12,"2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S & 4S Cabriolet: More Ponies, More Fun!","The 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S and 4S Cabriolet get a boost in engine performance.
Night Vision Assist, a manual transmission, and the Sport Chrono Package are optional. 
Hey, the new 911 Cabrios are here! Specifically, the 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S & 4S Cabriolet. What do you get? What’s so special this time around? Oh, this and that; gizmos and fender flares; a better soft top; improvements to stuff that lives on the dash. Those sort of things. But all you’re really going to care about is this: 443 horsepower and 390 lb-ft. of torque.
Yeah baby!
Cozy & Quick
Yes, if you want to divide things that way, the 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S and 4S Cabriolet will be the most cushy and boulevard cruiser-y of the bunch. But, 443 ponies and 390 lb-ft. of grunt means there will be lots of fun to be had, despite the lack of Spartan leanings.
The turbocharged flat-six engine in the latest 911 Cabriolet gets the same upgrades found on the recently introduced Coupe. Namely new piezo fuel injectors, larger turbos, and a new layout for the charge air cooling system. That 443 horsepower is an increase of 23 over the outgoing model. The eight-speed PDK dual clutch transmission in the rear-wheel drive version scoots the 911 to 60 in just 3.7 seconds. Nice!
Even nicer, the 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet with all-wheel drive does it in 3.6 seconds. Both cars are 0.4 seconds faster than the previous model by the way.
Sport Chrono Package/Manual Transmission: You Want These!
If you get the optional Sport Chrono Package, you shave off a further 0.2 seconds. I’d say get the Sport Chrono Package. Top “track” speeds are now 190 mph for the rear driver, and 188 for the all-wheel drive variety. Porsche says a manual transmission is coming at a later date. Gearheads say yay!
The PASM Sport Suspension with stiffer springs and sway bars, plus a 0.39 inch (10 mm) lower ride height is optionally available.

Safety Systems & Interior Technology
The new drop tops now feature a Wet Mode, which detects water on the road, preconditions the stability control and anti-lock brake systems to suit, and warns the driver. There’s a camera-based warning and brake assist system, also standard, that detects a potential collision with other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists and such. It warns you, or, kicks in emergency braking to help when necessary.

Night Vision Assist with a thermal imaging camera is an option.
The interior is completely new. The dash features the centrally-positioned tach, characteristic of Porsche, and two thin, frameless, free-form displays for driver information. The new Porsche Communication Management (PCM) is larger with a 10.9-inch touchscreen display, up from seven inches.
Spoilers, Light Bars & Drop Tops
Yes, they’ve widened the body. To keep the proportions right – thanks to the 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels – body width increased by 45 millimeters (1.77 inches), making room for a wider front track. Styling-wise, updates include flush electric door handles that extend outward, new LED headlights, and different contours for the front luggage compartment lid. There’s a significantly wider, variable-position rear spoiler and that “light bar” deal found on all current Porsches? Yes, it’s there on these 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera models.
Even more importantly: the entire outer skin is now made of aluminum. Huzzah!
The top, which is still old school fabric, takes 12 seconds to open or close with the new hydraulics. The top is capable of being opened and closed at speeds of up to 31 mph, which is so cool to do when you’re leaving the malt shop. Oh, and there’s an electric wind deflector to reduce drafts during top-down driving.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S Cabriolet has a base price of $126,100, while the Carrera 4S Cabriolet starts at $133,400. Yes, that’s a lot of money. But also yes, Porsche cars have always been on the expensive side. The 2020 911 Cabrios are expected to reach U.S. dealers late this summer.

2019/01/12,2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe: Just Call Me “Mercedes”,"The 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA is like a personal assistant on wheels.
The MBUX interface can recall the latest football scores and stock prices.
An overhaul in the suspension department should make for a smoother ride too.  
Mercedes is still making these things, eh? The latest iteration of the CLA “Coupe” is here, and it seems to be just as nice as its predecessor, which is good, considering Merc has been getting grief from some quarters. The only real complaint I have with the 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe is that it’s not a coupe at all.
But I’m kind of an automotive pendant that way.
Waxing Poetics
Look, it’s got four doors. I don’t care how swoopy you make the roofline, how much you rake that tumblehome, how clever your marketing copy is, four doors means it’s a sedan, and that’s the end of the discussion. Whatever they decide to call it, the 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe is an attractive car. And yes, I have concerns about all that style taking away from the rear seat utility (there’s no way the headroom is unaffected), but who cares.
It’s a nice looking car made by one of the best car companies on the planet.
So what do we get for our money?
Wider Is Better
Basically, the 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA Coupe is bigger all the way around: height, width, and length. It has been restyled, so it not only looks new, but MB is really accentuating the width of the thing (sort of like the “Wide Track Pontiacs” in the 60s). The meat, however, is in the interior gizmos and suspension.
With the track widened, up 63 millimeters at the front and 55 millimeters at the rear, the center of gravity drops and the handling improves. The front stabilizer bar is now larger for less body roll and an optional adaptive damping system is on offer. Further, the multi-link axle at the rear is “decoupled” for reducing noise and vibration. The Direct-Steer system is now standard, and hydro-mounts up front to provide the quiet and calm you expect in a Mercedes-Benz.
Your wheel choices are 18 and 19 inchers.
Football, Food & Fat Content
Now, about those gizmos that everybody demands these days. Say hello to MBUX. MBUX stands for Mercedes-Benz User Experience, and boy is that a dumb name. But here we are. MBUX is like a Mercedes version of Amazon’s Alexa, a voice control deal that, theoretically, can make your most specific wishes come true. Just say “Hey Mercedes” (no seriously, that’s how you get MBUX’s attention) and your CLA will respond to your commands.

The central control screen works in both sunlight and complete darkness, “warming up” as a hand approaches the touchscreen. This will highlight individual elements on the “currently active menu.” The system can even distinguish between the hands of drivers and passengers, so it knows which seat needs the massage function activated.
The “Hey Mercedes” voice recognition part is said to be so smart (and sensitive) that you can ask it stuff like “Find child-friendly Asian restaurants nearby with a 4-star rating which are neither Chinese nor Japanese?” You can ask your CLA to compare the share price of Apple and Microsoft, or what the square root of 3 is. If your passengers are wondering how big Texas is, or the fat content of an avocado, the CLA knows.
Why you would need to know most of that stuff while driving is beyond me, but Stuttgart seems to think it’s a good idea.
Safety & Security: Extra Eyes
In addition to the MBUX system (which I think is pronounced em-bucks, not ma-bucks) the CLA also cribbed a bunch of tech goodies from the current S-Class. The CLA is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations thanks to improved camera and radar systems that can see over 1,600 feet ahead. Safety features include Active Distance Assist, Active Emergency Stop Assist, Active Lane Change Assist, and Active Brake Assist among others.
Pricing & Availability
Mercedes makes little mention of the engines available (a very worrying sign), saying only that the CLA 250 has a four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with a 7G-DCT dual-clutch transmission. It’s available with front-wheel or 4MATIC all-wheel drive. Hopefully there will be more gearhead-oriented info to come later on, when Mercedes-Benz announces the price and delivery dates near the end of the year.

2019/01/11,2020 Ford Explorer: History Repeats Itself,"The 2020 Ford Explorer arrives as Americans demand more SUVs.
Ford analyzed consumer feedback, designing the new Explorer accordingly. 
More powerful engines compliment a host of convenience and safety technology.
In March of 1990, minivans broke into a cold sweat when the 1991 Ford Explorer moved into the neighborhood. While the two-door Explorer “Sport” helped the single crowd pursue all things 90s, the four-door became a viable option for families. Contrasting the minivan, the Explorer still had cargo space (81 cubic feet in 1991), kid-friendly features (child-proof rear door locks by 1992), and a ruggedness reserved for trucks (an advanced 4×4 system arrived in 1995).
A luxurious Eddie Bauer option meant these “truck-like” rides were even comfortable.
By Popular Demand
Today, Americans seek trucks and SUVs more than any other type of vehicle. According to the Associated Press, new vehicle sales in the United States rose 0.3 percent over a year ago to 17.27 million vehicles. By comparison, cars made up 32 percent of the pie, while trucks and SUVs accounted for 68 percent. Traditional cars are fading from view, evidenced by recent model cancellations and the race to win younger generations over with SUVs and crossovers.
The 2020 Ford Explorer will likely ride this rising wave of consumer demand all the way to the bank. Yet keeping the Explorer relevant, now 30 years on, has its challenges. Luckily for Ford, we consumers are somewhat predictable. We want our cake. We want to eat it too. And Facebook.
“Explorer drivers told us what they want – more capability, more power, more space,” explained Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s Head of Product Development and Purchasing. “They want more technology, not just for the driver, but for the whole family. And they want all of it with a beautifully sporty exterior.”
“We obsessed about what Explorer customers need and want,” added Bill Gubing, Explorer Chief Engineer. “We met with customer groups, pored through internet forums, and dissected social media posts to determine what they love about today’s Explorer and understand their pain points. Then we found ways to improve it across the board.”
Here is an in-depth look at those “improvements” in the 2020 Ford Explorer.
Power & Performance: Turbo City
The Ford Explorer’s first 4.0-liter V6 delivered 155 horsepower and 220 lb-ft. of torque. An all-aluminum, single-overhead cam 4.6-liter V8 appeared in 2006 along with a six-speed automatic.
And my how things have changed.
The 2020 Ford Explorer leverages two of the automaker’s multi-platform EcoBoost engines for V8-like power. The EcoBoost is famous for turbo charging in lieu of larger displacement, becoming an overnight sensation after teaming with the 2011 F-150. In reality, the EcoBoost existed well before the 2011 F-150 but that’s a story for another time.
Concerning the new Explorer, the top EcoBoost, a V6 plant, is projected for 365 horsepower and 380 lb-ft. of torque on 93 octane. The 2.3-liter EcoBoost, an in-line four by contrast, is projected for 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. of torque. Here’s something to chew on: The 1996 Ford Explorer had 215 horsepower and 280 lb-ft. of torque. With a 5.0 V8.

When properly equipped, the 3.0-liter EcoBoost tows up to 5,600 lbs., a 12 percent increase over the 3.5-liter EcoBoost it replaces. The 2.3-liter gets a solid bump in towing capacity too, now tugging 5,300 lbs. with a Class III Trailer Tow Package versus its current 3,000 lbs. rating.
Lucky #7: Drive Modes
With the available Terrain Management System, the 2020 Ford Explorer offers seven different drive modes, although there is a caveat. The new Explorer is predicated upon a rear-wheel drive architecture, which according to Ford, enables a sportier, more athletic design, improved driving capabilities etc. etc.
And fair enough.
That said, real-wheel drive Explorers receive only six drives modes, excluding Deep Snow/Sand. Here is what they look like:
#1. Normal
Exactly what it sounds like. Use for everyday driving.
#2. Sport
Increases throttle and steering responses while the suspension stiffens. The transmission holds gears longer to increase acceleration.
#3. Eco
If Sport Mode were Red Bull, this is carbonated water.
#4. Tow/Haul
This mode makes the transmission more efficient when towing. Tow/Haul is especially handy when climbing hills as it keeps the transmission out of overdrive. When cresting a hill, pressing the brake pedal in this mode facilates engine braking.
#5. Slippery
When Wet. Bon Jovi anyone? Slippery mode adjusts pedal response, traction control, and the transmission when ice or gravel is present. Ford says this mode even works on grass. So now you can park on your front lawn. Also, side note, the Explorer offers a 980-watt, 14-speaker B&O premium audio system. What’s your favorite Bon Jovi album now?
#6. Deep Snow/Sand
Similar to Slippery, this mode adjusts the pedal response, traction control, and the transmission for heavier snow and sand.
#7. Trail
When canvassing those muddy, uneven back roads, use this mode.
Captain & Co-Pilot: Safety & Security
2002 was a milestone year for the Explorer in terms of safety. Ford’s AdvanceTrac stability control was introduced, along with four-wheel antilock braking and electronic brake force distribution. Ford’s Personal Safety System featured dual-stage driver and front-passenger airbags, their deployment based on crash severity, driver’s seat position, and front occupant safety-belt usage.
Fast forward 18 years to Co-Pilot360, a suite of advanced driver assistance systems, standard on the 2020 Ford Explorer. Co-Pilot 360 includes Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking, Pedestrian Detection, Forward Collision Warning, and Evasive Steering Assist – all to help avoid a collision. Post impact, Co-Pilot 360 deploys the brakes to lessen the impact of a secondary collision.
Blind Spot Information with Cross-Traffic Alert, Adaptive Cruise Control with Speed Sign Recognition, and a review camera are also part of Co-Pilot 360.

“It’s not about filling the vehicle with technology for technology’s sake,” said Chris Billman, Ford Co-Pilot360 Engineering Manager. “It’s about improving the experience, making driving less stressful, and helping the driver to feel more confident behind the wheel.”
Those who live in bustling neighborhoods may consider adding the available Reverse Brake Assist. The feature uses radar and ultrasonic sensors to detect objects while backing up, applying the brakes automatically if something gets too close. Useful especially for exiting the driveway. Reverse Brake Assist is an enhanced version of the original Reverse Sensing, which first appeared on the Explorer in 1999.
Beam Me Up: Technology & Connectivity
Everything but the kitchen sink! (and that might even be in there somewhere with the new Explorer’s 87.8 cubic feet of cargo space). Passengers in all three rows can settle in with FordPass Connect, a standard feature that serves up 4G LTE Wi-Fi for up to 10 mobile devices. For drivers, FordPass Connect gives them remote access to their Explorer via their phone.
They can lock, unlock, locate and start the SUV, and monitor vehicle diagnostics from the app.
A tablet-like touchscreen display resides on the center stack, employing capacitive glass to mimic the feel of our modern smartphones. The standard SYNC 3 infotainment system includes Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Waze navigation.
Keeping the juice flowing should be easy in the 2020 Ford Explorer. There’s an available wireless charging pad, up to four USB ports, including new type-C outlets, up to three 12-volt outlets, and a 110-volt outlet. And to think, back in 2007, an auxiliary input for the stereo became standard equipment for the Explorer. That was a big deal back then.
Putting It All Together
The 2020 Ford Explorer comes in base, XLT, Limited, Limited Hybrid, ST, and Platinum flavors. The 2.3-liter EcoBoost is standard on base, XLT, and Limited, with the Platinum getting the larger V6. Both are paired to a new 10-speed automatic. 18-inch wheels are standard although Platinum models come with 21-inchers. In total, there are seven wheel designs on offer.
Naturally, the Platinum gets all the fixin’s: door handles with satin aluminum inserts, liftgate appliqué, roof-rack side rails, moonroof, leather seats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.

2019/01/09,Lamborghini Huracán EVO: On The 1s & 2s,"The Lamborghini Huracán EVO is a noticeable improvement over the prior generation.
A dynamic control system optimizes performance and handling be it on the street or track.
Lamborghini goes a little overboard describing the car at times, like dating profile overboard.  
Lamborghini, finally, is not content to leave well enough alone. The Sant’Agata Bolognese company has a habit of realizing the shortcomings of a given model; then just junking that model entirely and replacing it with a whole new one. Lambo seems to have put that behind them with the new Huracán EVO, a car that corrects and improves upon the original Huracán.
Just Breathe (Normally)
The engine of the EVO, arguably the most important part of any Lamborghini, is the same basic V10 from before, just uprated and tweaked here and there. I think this is the same plant the Italians got from the Audi R8 when the Germans bought Lambo. Everybody agreed that was a good move (both the engine and getting bought by Germans).
And the virtuousness of that shows in what this mill brings to the party.
We’re talking about a 5.2-liter naturally-aspirated V10 with higher power output, titanium intake valves, and a lightweight exhaust system. The Lamborghini Huracán EVO cranks out 640 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. of torque. Since the Huracán EVO tips the scales at a not all that bad 3,100 lbs, it can hit 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds and 124 mph in nine seconds. It tops out at 202 mph. Nice!
It can stop too (thankfully), hauling itself down from 62 mph to zero in just 105 feet. However, the Huracán EVO’s performance evolution is evident outside the engine and braking departments.
Digital Underground: On The 1s & 2s (And Zeros)
It’s found in the electrical signals and those little 1s and 0s, bouncing back as they make their residence in the LDVI controller. That’s short for Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata! And what that mouthful of spaghetti does is control everything in the go/stop/turn department the way a conductor leads an orchestra.
The LDVI handles the rear-wheel steering and torque vectoring system, effectively working at all four wheels. LDVI controls a sub-suite of accelerometers and gyroscopic sensors – the Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale (LPI) – located at the car’s center of gravity. LPI monitors lateral, longitudinal, and vertical accelerations, along with roll, pitch, and yaw in real-time. The LPI system feeds data to the LDVI, tweaking the magneto-rheological suspension to immediately adjust the damping.
Driver Controls: Different Animal In Each One
Naturally, there are new traction control parameters working in concert with the all-wheel drive and torque vectoring systems. Yes, even the steering is part of this zuppa di alfabeto. Lamborghini’s “Dynamic Steering,” for example, provides better responsiveness in the corners, according to the automaker. The technology is coupled with the rear-wheel steering for greater stability during high-speed cornering and braking.
RELATED
2020 Audi A5: This Hot Tamale Is Still Smokin'
Each of these systems is driver-operated via the ANIMA controller in one of three modes: STRADA, SPORT or CORSA. Think of it as Lambo’s version of Ferrari’s Manettino system. STRADA, or Street, aims for capable yet agile enjoyment. SPORT becomes “playful, intuitive, and extremely exciting,” according to the automaker. This sounds less like the Huracán EVO and more like Lamborghini’s bio on their Tinder profile.
Naturally CORSA, Track, is much sharper and reactive for racing.

The Lamborghini Huracán EVO also gets an aero haircut; some trimming here and there, kicks and flips, and other bits and bobs. There’s a new front bumper and splitter with an integrated wing. The air intakes are enlarged too while a slotted spoiler enhances air flow. Lambo has also gone over the EVO’s underbody, reshaping it to improve aerodynamic efficiency more than five times over the first gen Huracán.
And, since you want everybody to know you’re driving the new Huracán EVO, there’s some styling cues to set you apart. The “show model” is presented in Arancio Xanto, a new four-layer color most likely coming for production cars. You will also find new 20-inch Aesir rims wrapped in Pirelli P Zero tires. The interior trim features an Alcantara and leather mix, with Arancio Dryope styling details that match the body tone and ambient lights.
Lamborghini’s patented Carbon Skin is available on request.

Must. Have. Connectivity.
As much as I’d like all cars, especially ones from Lamborghini, to simply be about The Pure Driving Experience, I understand it’s 2019. Connectivity is a thing everybody expects these days. Besides, if it works right, why not be able to find your way to the next available greasy spoon for a good-bad breakfast after an early morning of carving it up?
The Huracán EVO has an 8.4-inch HMI touchscreen above the start button, with voice and gesture control. The touchscreen seems to contorl everything: seats, navigation, status of the LDVI system, and infotainment things like Apple CarPlay.
Pricing & Availability
The Lamborghini Huracán EVO arrives this spring. It should cost you around $261,274 which, yes, is a lot of green. But that’s also right where Lambos always are; a little less than a Ferrari and a little more than a Porsche.

2018/12/29,Building Your McLaren Speedtail: Like Savile Row With Horsepower!,"The McLaren Speedtail was recently revealed to future owners at a private event.
The Speedtail is the first of 18 new cars under the company’s Track25 business plan.
It’s the fastest car in the automaker’s history. Now it’s arguably the most personalized. 
I think this all started with the McLaren F1. I remember buyers could get their name woven into the carbon fiber, if they so desired. You know, something along the lines of “This McLaren F1 made especially for Sir Manfredjinsinjin” or something like that. And now things have gone to a whole new level with the McLaren Speedtail, the direct successor to the P1 and the spiritual successor to the stunning F1.
Only The Finest
You know Savile Row, right? That’s the street in London where the world’s best tailors work. You can be shaped like a flour sack with a rope tied in the middle, and Savile row tailors will make you look like James Bond. That’s what McLaren is doing, in a certain way, with their upcoming Speedtail hypercar.
No, they’re not going to alter the structure or size of the car for you (that’s definitely a one size fits all deal), but they will let you choose more than just the color.
Literally Everything Is “Bespoke”
This is all very high-touch, extremely personalized service that only the very rich demand these days. And McLaren ain’t kidding around. The mechanical package of the Speedtail is cast in stone and won’t be messed with. Which is as it should be. McLaren knows what they are doing and, performance-wise, the 250-mph hypercar seems to be a dead on bull’s eye.
The story here is that well-heeled buyers of the Speedtail can specify every aspect with regard to the look and feel of their individual car. And much like fashion houses, McLaren has three design “collections” curated by their Colour and Material design team. The three collections are Urbane, Visionary, and Dynamic.
What, like you didn’t think this was going to get pretentious quicker than the Speedtail could hit 60? By the way, the McLaren Speedtail hits 186 mph in 12.8 seconds.
Related: There was once a McLaren made entirely out of Legos.
Urbane & Visionary Collections
Urbane is a collection of three themes offering a discriminating and sophisticated feel, with calm exterior hues and subtle, cool interior tones. Take the Stratosphere, for example, in the Urbane collection. Stratosphere accentuates the exterior highlights of the car’s aerodynamic bodywork, set off with bespoke, brushed light blue anodized aluminum brightwork. The cabin blends the metallic light blue driver’s seat with light grey passenger seats.

Even the badging goes to the Nth degree with the Stratosphere option.
The Visionary collection offers up the Astral theme, a nod to the UK’s nautical heritage. The navy blue dominated interior with nubuck, bespoke navy passenger seats, and a full aniline leather navy driver’s seat (also bespoke) are among the highlights. The exterior of the Astral theme features, for some reason, an orange and silver pinstripe? Also on the exterior: gloss 1K visual carbon fiber and 18 carat white gold with TPT inlay badging.
Just don’t leave the doors open for very long.
[bctt tweet=”@McLarenAuto is not going to alter the structure or size of the car for you (that’s definitely a one size fits all deal), but they will let you choose more than just the color.” username=”Automoblog”]
Dynamic Theme & Additional Tailoring
Dynamic, which goes for modern, sporty, futuristic, and sumptuous is epitomized by the Bloodline theme. Bespoke red on the exterior, with gloss black diamond cut wheels and silver brake calipers. Inside the driver’s seat is full aniline bespoke red, while the passengers sit on semi aniline bespoke white seats. The steering wheel clasp, paddle shifters, window and door bezel surround are highlighted in TPT carbon quartz white.
Then comes the really personalized, Savile Row custom-tailored parts of the McLaren Speedtail. Body and interior panels finished in satin 1K or gloss 1K with interwoven gold visual carbon fiber or anodized aluminum, which is pretty crazy, if you think about it. Interior options include nubuck and aniline leather, TPT carbon control surfaces, 18 carat white gold, and TPT carbon badging. Electro-chromatic glazing tints do away with the need for sun visors.
Related: The McLaren Speedtail is an angel in the outfield.
Orange & Black Is The New Black
No, in case you’re asking, you don’t do this by checking a bunch of boxes on the order sheet. As a Speedtail buyer, you get your own Bespoke Liaison Manager to help bring your vision to life. Your Bespoke Liaison Manager is your personal connection to McLaren Special Operations to help you work on selecting colors and materials.
But honestly, none of this matters to me. I am a simple man, of simple automotive tastes, and I will take my McLaren Speedtail in Papaya Orange with a black interior, just like Bruce would have.

2018/12/27,Goodbye Keys! Hello Hyundai’s Fingerprint Technology,"Hyundai’s technology allows drivers to unlock and start their vehicle with their fingerprints.
An on-board security system helps determine the driver’s actual prints to prevent theft.
The technology is another example of how consumers want a vehicle to fit their lifestyle.  
It sounds like something out of science fiction. Like those movies where the crew, in order to open the hatch to the spaceship’s next corridor, place their hands on a blue-lit screen. Hyundai is now using that Hollywood magic with “smart fingerprint technology,” set to debut in the first quarter of next year.
Smart fingerprint technology allows drivers to unlock the doors and start the vehicle with a single touch.
What a time to be alive.
How It Works
The Santa Fe is the first to receive Hyundai’s new wizardry, one of our favorite SUVs today interestingly enough. To unlock the vehicle, place a finger (even your middle one?) on the door handle sensor. The encrypted fingerprint information is verified, then sent to a controller inside the vehicle. If the prints match the doors unlock. Once inside, starting the vehicle is done by touching the ignition, which uses its own fingerprint scanning sensor.
If the prints match, the engine fires up.
If the prints don’t match? Does the vehicle transform into a Bumble Bee style cyborg and defend its perimeter? It would be cool and would likely deter thieves, but unfortunately, no. And it’s not entirely foolproof either.
Security Protocol: Detecting Imposters
Hyundai says by using “capacitance recognition” they are able to address fake fingerprints. Capacitance recognition detects differentials in the electricity levels in various parts of our fingertips. The approach helps weed out forgeries and fake fingerprints. According to Hyundai, the technology’s chance of misrecognizing another person’s print is only one in 50,000.
Hyundai also says this is five times more effective than conventional keys, including smart keys. Valid point. But what if you’re the one? The one who gets their beloved Santa Fe stolen by fingerprint hackers while getting groceries? Might we suggest a steering wheel club just to be safe?
The good news though? The system operates through the “real-time learning” of fingerprints, in support by a “dynamic update” system. Perfect. A vague but just techy enough description that it must certainly work. According to Hyundai, this means the fingerprint system continually improves its “success rate.”
What a time to be alive.

The Personalization Trend
Hyundai’s fingerprint technology is really cool but not overly surprising. Given that buyers today enjoy how vehicles can be increasingly personalized, such technology only makes sense. After all, this is the very basis of dashboard touchscreens today. They allow the vehicle, from the ambient lighting to the radio presets, to be configured in a personal way.
Memory seat positions and various drive mode settings for the powertrain? Infotainment and connectivity systems? Much the same, each existing as more ways to tailor a vehicle to individual tastes. Examine now, for instance, what you like about your vehicle? Chances are it has something to do with how it fits your own personal preferences.
Unless you drive a hooptie. But even then.
“In the future, Hyundai Motor plans to further expand the application of the technology to allow the adjustment of temperature, steering wheel position, and many other features which will be tailored to driver’s preferences” said Albert Biermann, President and Head of Research & Development, Hyundai Motor Company. “This will ultimately offer quality driving experiences to each and every Hyundai customer.”
[bctt tweet=”@Hyundai’s fingerprint technology is really cool, but not overly surprising.” username=”Automoblog”]
Fingerprint Technology In 2019
Hyundai’s fingerprint technology will debut in select markets in early 2019, gradually expanding to others. Although they don’t say where exactly or when they will expand to other markets. Hyundai does say, however, they are planning to implement other customizable technologies like this across their lineup. By doing this, Hyundai believes they can strengthen their position in the future mobility market.
In the meantime, we’re stuck with our stupid keys. Figures.

2018/12/20,"McLaren 720S Spider: Performance Necessary, Roof Optional","The McLaren 720S Spider is remarkably similar to its stablemate, the 720S.
The Monocage II-S is one of the most impressive things about the Spider’s design.
However, wait until you see the tinted/transparent roof feature. 
To make a good car even better, remove the top. Or so goes the old saying, and it’s one I usually agree with. In this case, we’re talking about the new Spider variant of the already impressive McLaren 720S. People really do seem to love this car, and the specs of the McLaren 720S Spider are very impressive.
McLaren says this new Spider mirrors the Coupé in almost every aspect and that’s fair.
So, what’s the drop-top like?
Power & Performance: A Similar Story
Basically, the 720S Spider is a match to its hard-top brother, the 720S. It’s powered by the same 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, designed and built in-house by McLaren. That’s good enough for 710 bhp and 568 lb-ft. of torque and, for the Spider, a power-to-weight ratio of 533 bhp/ton. Impressive as one would expect.
This all adds up to a zero to 60 mph time of 2.8 seconds, same as the 720S Coupé. 124 mph is reached in 7.9 seconds, and the whole thing tops out at 212 mph with the roof up, 202 mph with it down. Either of those figures are attention grabbing, but hitting the double ton with the wind in your hair must be something.
McLaren says the new 720S Spider is the “most accomplished convertible supercar ever from McLaren” and I’ll take them at their word. Although the qualifier there, “from McLaren” does away with pointing out convertibles that are even faster and quicker, like Porsche’s 918 and the Ferrari 458 Speciale Aperta.
Essential Foundations: The Heart of the Matter
McLaren is right, however, to crow about their Monocage II-S. Essentially, the Monocage is like a roll cage you’d bolt and weld into your car, but it differs in two important ways. First, it’s made of carbon fiber, so it’s lighter and just as strong, and two, the Monocage II-S is the car. Everything connects to the Monocage; you sit inside its cozy confines, secure in the rollover protection it provides.
In the case of the Spider, it’s worth pointing out how the Monocage needs no additional strengthening over how it’s designed and integrated into Coupé. In other words, the Spider is just as stiff as the Coupe.
Impressive McLaren, very impressive.
The carbon fiber body structure is bespoke, of course, and built in-house (McLaren must have autoclaves all over the place). Normally, drop tops weigh more than their hard top counterparts. This is true for the 720S Spider, but not all that bad. Dry, the McLaren 720S Spider tips the scales at 2,937 lbs., just 108 lbs. more than the 720S Coupé. Nice!
RELATED
Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA: Beautiful, Bold & Light
McLaren says their new Spider is “194 lbs. less than the dry weight of its closest competitor,” but they don’t say who that is.
Fast Car Magic
Another neat trick is how the panels and such comprise the retractable roof itself. For starters, the flying buttresses are glazed and transparent. This significantly ups the visibility (practical) and highlights the aerodynamic cleanliness of the design. They also say it increases downforce, but never elaborate beyond that.
The roof itself, or the “carbon fiber roof system” as McLaren terms it, is patented (natch), electrically-actuated and lowers (and closes back up) in 11 seconds, up to 31 mph. That’s nice, and dropping that top while on the move is everso stylish. However, someone needs to tell the boys from Woking the Ferrari Superamerica from 2005 could flip its lid in nine seconds flat.
Another trick they cribbed from the Ferrari Superamerica is the retractable hard top on the McLaren 720S Spider. It’s available glazed, with an electrochromic glass panel that can rapidly switch between tinted and transparent. This is like those eye glasses that darken as needed, only the driver controls how dark, or how transparent the roof is.
Pricing & Availability
So, how much? Very much. Prices for the McLaren 720S Spider start at $315,000. The 720S Spider is second new model under McLaren Automotive’s Track25 business plan.

2018/12/19,2019 Porsche Macan S: Holding The Middle Ground,"The 2019 Porsche Macan S features a turbo-charged V6 with nearly 350 horsepower.
Porsche’s Sport Chrono package allows for a slightly quicker zero to 60 time. 
I’ve heard nothing but glowing praise for Porsche’s mid-sized SUV, the Macan. Everyone I’ve read or talked to says it handles great (for an SUV) and now, with the addition of a new V6 turbo, 2019 looks better for those considering the purchase of a German SUV.
“More power, optimized chassis, improved comfort,” or so sayeth Porsche. And all those things sound good to me. Especially the more power and improved comfort parts. Macans seem like a good middle ground in a lot of ways, for the Euro SUV consumer. Stylish, fast and all that stuff, but not as off-road capable as its big brother, the Cayenne.
Hence the interest in “improved comfort.”
For some (read Americans) the Macan might not be big enough. It sure seems to work in urban environments, but for the long haul, driving form Chicago to New Orleans, for example, it might not work. So “improving comfort” for the occupants might translate into more North American sales.
Now, about that new engine.
Zero To 60: Respectable Indeed
The 2019 Porsche Macan S comes with a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6, putting out 348 horsepower and 354 lb-ft. of torque. Healthy. That new plant marks a bump in both horsepower and torque over the older 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 used in previous versions of the Macan S.
Bottom line: zero to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds with the Sport Chrono package and a top track (ha!) speed of 157 mph. By comparison, the zero to 60 time is 5.1 seconds without the Sport Chrono package.
Not bad for a “truck.”
Related: The history of Porsche is chronicled in this fantastic book.
All About The “V”
This new V6 mill will be shared with the Panamera, Cayenne, and Cayenne E-Hybrid models. As is the engineering fashion these days, the single twin-scroll turbocharger lives centrally within the inner-V of the engine. Yes, I know, there’s sound engineering reasons for this – shorter exhaust paths from the combustion chambers to the turbocharger, improved responsiveness – and yes, I know I am no engineer, but boy, stuffing a high-heat application right there in the middle of the engine sure gives me the heebie-jeebies, thermally speaking.
But hey, if a bunch of engineers from Stuttgart say it’s okay, who am I to argue?
Porsche goes on to say how the exhaust gasses feed continuously into the turbine wheel for lower lag times. Stuttgart also tweaked the combustion chamber geometry with centrally positioned fuel injectors for more efficient mixture formation.

Braking & Chassis: Improvements All Around
And, since this is a Porsche, the braking is fantastic. Porsche says you’ll notice a discernable improvement in brake pedal feel. The Macan’s new pedal is 300 grams lighter and connects to the master cylinder through a shorter lever arm. The new Macan S also adds larger front brake discs, up by 10 millimeters in diameter and two millimeters in thickness to 360 by 36 millimeters.
If that’s not enough, the Macan S can also be had with the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake system.
The chassis upgrades include staggered front and rear tires, along with Porsche Traction Management/all-wheel drive as standard. Front axle strut forks are made from aluminum (away go the previous steel components), unsprung mass is down, the anti-roll bars get a re-tune, and the steering is more precise. Porsche even cribbed the optional GT Sport steering wheel from the 911 for the Macan S.
Porsche’s Active Stability Management, a height-adjustable air suspension with improved rolling pistons, new shock absorber hydraulics, and Porsche’s Torque Vectoring Plus are optionally available.
[bctt tweet=”As is the engineering fashion these days, @Porsche has the twin-scroll turbocharger centrally within the inner-V of the engine. ” username=”Automoblog”]
Extra Stuff: Air Ionizers & Heated Windshields
There’s a host of tech goodies too. The Porsche Communication Management system is standard with online navigation and real-time traffic information, two audio interfaces, smartphone connections, and intelligent voice controls. Finally, there is an LTE phone module, SIM card reader, and Wi-Fi hotspot.
A heated windshield is available, along with an optional cabin air ionizer.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Porsche Macan S will be at your local Porsche store this summer, with starting price of $59,650. That’s not bad at all, considering this a Porsche.

2018/12/17,2020 Porsche 911: An Engineering Marvel Considering . . .,"The 2020 Porsche 911 represents the 8th generation of the automaker’s iconic nameplate.
It’s wider and more aggressive looking with a new version of Porsche’s flat-six engine. 
Expect a multitude of driver assist systems when the new 911 hits the market next year.
The 2020 Porsche 911 just rolled out at the L.A. auto show, and it further cements, and further dilutes what the quintessential Porsche is. It’s bigger, heavier, more complex; it cranks out more power and gives you more performance. That Porsche can keep doing this, despite ever rising levels of weight and complexity, is an engineering miracle.
However, that they have to do it this way is a disaster.
Simple & Effective
The 911 started out as a brilliant response to a simple question: “How can we make the 356 better?” The 356, for all its fun and capability was, at it’s heart, a hot-rodded VW Beetle in better clothing. The first 911, for all its flaws (they had to weld pig iron to the front bumpers, the chassis tuning was so far off) answered that question in so comprehensive a manner that the 911 “worked” for decades.
Then, right about 1998, Porsche realized you can only push air and oil cooling so far, and the 911 changed. Then changed some more. And it changed even more from there.
Related: Enthusiasts will appreciate this book, which chronicles the history of Porsche.
Which leads us to this, the 2020 Porsche 911; bigger, longer, wider, heavier, bloated and, thanks to the dedicated application of Engineering, the “best” 911 ever. The 2020 911 is loaded with everything the modern “sports” car shopper demands (and Porsche shamelessly kowtows to). And yet, it still delivers sparkling performance.
What do we get for 2020 (besides that smug satisfaction)? Lots of everything!
Styling & Design: Some History, Some Necessity
The new body design is bigger all around, with wider fenders over staggered wheels (20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the back). The flared fenders of the sportier 911s are now seen on all models. New LED headlights flow into the fenders and aim for that round shape of the original 911. The door handles are now flush and the outside mirrors are meant to reduce wind noise.
The rear has that same “light bar” as found across the Porsche range.
Of course, there’s a big honking spoiler that’s appreciably wider with variable positions. Best of all, apart from the front and rear fasciae, the entire outer skin of the car is now made of aluminum. A nice, classic touch but also an engineering necessity because 911s are getting fat.
Related: The 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS sounds like something NASA would build.
Interior Treatments: The Wild West
The interior has undergone a thorough redesign, but still manages to be an ergonomic nightmare. I can only chalk this up to “tradition” and the fact that Porsche people actually like when button placement and such comes across as a total afterthought. The tach is still front and center (thank you) but now we have the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system front and center in the middle console.
RELATED
Acura MDX PMC Edition Arrives: Here's How It's Different.
The seats are a complete redesign, with significantly improved lateral support at the shoulder.
However, Porsche really trumpets the new assistance systems, said to increase safety and comfort.
Assistance Systems: Tech Nannies & Babysitters
Those of us that are cynical enough to say it will mention that, yeah, you’re going to need all the “assistance systems” you can find to overcome the physics of having all that weight waaaay back there. Porsche now how the “Wet Mode” as standard equipment for the 2020 Porsche 911. Wet Mode detects water on the road, preconditions the stability control and anti-lock brake systems accordingly, and warns the driver.
You can call up vehicle settings particularly suited for wet roads via a button, or by means of the mode switch on the steering wheel. You know, so that way you don’t spin your brand new 911 off into the weeds like overconfident 911 owners since time immemorial.
There’s also a camera-based warning and brake assist system, standard, and Night Vision Assist with a thermal imaging camera. The Adaptive Cruise Control comes with automatic distance control, stop-and-go functionality, and an Emergency Assist function.
Power & Performance: No Worries Here
Yes, yes, I hear you shriek: what about the engine? Here, we have no worries or concerns. The next gen turbocharged flat-six engine has a primary focus on performance. New, larger turbochargers with electrically-controlled wastegate valves, a completely redesigned charge air intercooler, and piezo fuel injectors all help this 911 engine be the best engine it can be.
Everything is better with the 2020 Porsche 911: responsiveness, power, torque characteristics, the whole enchilada. Bottom line: 443 horsepower at 6,500 rpm (23 horsepower more than the previous model), 390 lb-ft. of torque (22 lb-ft. up from the previous model), and a comfortably-wide powerband from 2,300 to 5,000 rpm.
Meaning you should be able to work this thing all day and night.
Pricing & Availability
The 2020 Porsche 911 Carrera S starts at $113,200, which is not unreasonable. You can order yours now but the new 911 should be in U.S. dealers by this summer.

2018/12/15,"2019 Hyundai Kona Electric: Compact, Efficient & Strong","The 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric is much cheaper than a Tesla Model X. The Model X runs for around $110,000 on average and, for that price, you could buy three, maybe four 2019 Hyundai Kona Electrics. Consider that, and also consider that Hyundai, as a company, isn’t going away any time soon.
Consider how companies like Hyundai are making EV technology more affordable.
Cautionary Tales
I know that might not be all that fair, given Tesla’s preeminence in the EV world, but you have to keep in mind that Tesla is a very new company. And even if it was started with the best of intentions, no shortage of cash and ground-breaking technology, the road to competing in the car market is littered with other such noble failures from Tucker up to and including Elio.
Platform & Technology
The new Kona Electric is, apart from the EV drivetrain, just like a regular Kona. It rides on the same long wheelbase with short overhangs and wide track underpinned by a MacPherson strut front suspension, a multi-link rear suspension, and standard 17-inch alloy wheels. The Kona EV uses the same hot-stamping methods to produce lightweight, ultra-strong structural elements to maximize the cabin’s central safety cell.
It has the same active safety features, including Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist, Lane Keeping Assist, High Beam Assist, and Driver Attention Warning.
Infotainment & Vehicle Services
And the 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric also has all the standard infotainment one would expect: Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, SiriusXM Radio, HD Radio, and Blue Link LTE-powered connectivity. The standard seven-inch color LCD display includes auxiliary inputs, voice recognition, and a Rear View Monitor. The available eight-inch touchscreen navigation display includes traffic flow and incident data via HD radio, Infinity premium audio, Clari-Fi music-restoration technology, and smartphone integration.
These “Blue Link” services are a big deal to Hyundai and all Kona Electric models include a complimentary three-year term. Blue Link has enhanced safety, diagnostic, and remote and guidance services, along with a list of connectivity tech: Google Home, Remote Start with Climate Control, Destination Search by Voice, Remote Door Lock/Unlock, Car Finder, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, and Stolen Vehicle Recovery.
The Kona Electric adds exclusive EV-oriented features such as Remote Charge Management, Charge Scheduling, EV Power History, and EV Range.
Power & Performance
But it is, naturally, the EV features that will set the Kona Electric apart. The powertrain employs a high-efficiency 150 kW permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor supplied by a high-voltage 64 kWh lithium-ion battery. That’s good enough for 201 horsepower and 291 lb-ft. of torque delivered to the front wheels. The estimated range of the Kona Electric is a “generous” 258 miles, according to Hyundai

The battery system is liquid-cooled and operates at 356 volts. Battery pack energy density is 141.3 Wh/kg (greater than a Chevy Bolt, Hyundai notes) with a total system weight under 1,000 lbs.
The Kona Electric utilizes a Level-II on-board charging system capable of a 7.2 kW rate of charge for rapid recharging. Eighty percent charge can be had in 54 minutes with a Level-III quick charge. The 100 kW DC fast-charging capability is standard all Kona Electrics and for your charging convenience, the port is located in the front grille area.
Handy Tools
The other interesting thing found on the Kona Electric is the MyHyundai with Blue Link app. With this nifty little gizmo you can manage and monitor the Kona Electric remotely.
If you live in an area with different electric rates at off-peak times, you can schedule the Kona Electric to charge to reduce cost and peak demand on the electric grid based on time and date. For example, you could set up a charging schedule to start at 10 p.m. every Wednesday and Thursday. Handy! Blue Link again for the win.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric SEL starts at $36,950. The Limited starts at $41,400 and the Ultimate comes in at $44,900. Tack on another $1,045 for destination and freight. There are electric vehicle tax credits available to offset these costs. Expect the Kona Electric in California first, with states in the western and northeastern regions of the U.S. to follow later this year.

2018/12/13,5 Reasons Why The Rivian R1T Should Make Tesla Nervous,"The Rivian R1T is an all-electric truck from the Illinois-based manufacturer. 
One powertrain option cranks out 700 horsepower and over 800 lb-ft. of torque.
At the moment, Rivian is unchallenged in this venture. Other automakers should take note.  
The 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show saw the unveiling of the Rivian R1T all-electric pickup truck. The U.S.-based automotive startup also showcased the R1S all-electric SUV. The company says both are the world’s first electric adventure vehicles.
And while electric SUVs are becoming commonplace (do the Tesla Model X, Jaguar I-PACE, and Audi e-tron ring a bell?), the big car makers have yet to showcase an all-electric pickup truck – not even Tesla, mind you.
And while Tesla is currently developing their very own electric pickup, Rivian has beaten them to the chase. Feast your eyes on the Rivian R1T. It is the first-ever electric utility vehicle or EUV. And from the looks of it alone, this pickup truck is sure to make a splash when it arrives in late 2020.
Here are our top five reasons why the Rivian R1T is probably making Tesla nervous as we speak.
#1: The Rivian R1T Looks The Part
Rivian began in 2009 behind the vision of Robert Scaringe. The company unveiled their first plan to build electric cars in 2011. This gave them more than enough leeway to do it right the first time. And instead of building a humdrum electric hatchback, Rivian is pulling our heartstrings with what is purportedly the first production all-electric truck.
And boy, did they really nail it with the design! However, I have apprehensions on the front-end styling. There’s a thin illuminated stripe that runs across the width of the front fascia, which is nice touch. But if you add the pair of “stadium” LED headlights and the undramatic front bumper, it sort of looks like a hippopotamus in heat. But Rivian has a point. The front design makes the R1T easily recognizable.
Thankfully, things get better as you gaze your eyes to the sides and rear of the truck. In fact, you will find the same design cues in the R1S SUV. With short overhangs, a higher ground clearance, and commendable approach and departure angles, the Rivian R1T is screaming for adventure.
Barring the weird front styling, the Rivian R1T is a handsome-looking truck. The rear is simple yet elegant with just a thin LED light that runs across the width of the tailgate. It still has the familiar boxy look of a conventional pickup truck, but the edges are more rounded to give the truck a sleeker and modern look. Good job, Rivian!

#2: It’s An Active Lifestyle Vehicle
Yes, Tesla vehicles are a lifestyle choice, too. But they cater to a different sort of clientèle. On the other hand, Rivian is seriously targeting the active lifestyle niche. You know, the sort of people who buy an SUV or pickup and actually take it off the beaten path.
Let’s start with the interior. Tesla vehicles have minimalist cabins. I personally appreciate this approach to keep the dashboard clean and elegant. But the interior materials and build quality are not the strongest points of any Tesla vehicle, which Rivian is willing to address with the R1T.
“Although the exterior of the vehicle is what first attracts you, the interior is where you spend the most of your time, so we really focused on creating a transformational space inside our vehicles,” said Jeff Hammoud, VP of Vehicle Design at Rivian. “The biggest challenge was creating an interior design that delivered a premium experience.”
[bctt tweet=”@Rivian is seriously targeting the active lifestyle niche” username=”Automoblog”]
#3: More Than A Pretty Face
Without a doubt, the Rivian R1T benefits from a beautiful cabin that seats up to five adults. The center display measures 15.6-inches and is oriented horizontally instead of vertically like in a Tesla. The instrument cluster is replaced with a 12.3-inch display like modern Audi and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The dashboard is flanked with sustainable wood and polished metal. The seats, steering wheel, and door panels are covered in leather to further add a touch of refinement.
Even the high-wear areas in the interior benefit from materials inspired by sportswear and active gear, which basically means everything is durable and easy to clean.
But the Rivian R1T is special because it’s an EV that can handle some pretty intense weather and off-road conditions. The battery pack is encased in carbon fiber and ballistic shields for maximum toughness. The vehicle can wade through river crossings up to three feet deep. The maximum tow rating is 11,000 lbs. It even comes with an adjustable air suspension that can be configured for highway and off-road driving.
Unless Ford, GM, or Tesla makes an electric truck, it looks like Rivian will go unchallenged in this segment.
#4: Quad-Motors: Balanced & Linear Power
Why have two or three electric motors when you can have one at each wheel? That’s what we get with the Rivian R1T. This means the truck is riding on a quad motor, all-electric, all-wheel drivetrain. When paired with the massive 180 kWh battery pack (which is way more than what Tesla is offering right now), the Rivian R1T claims a 400-mile range on a single charge!
RELATED
AutoSens Detroit Postponed Amid Coronavirus Outbreak
In that configuration, the Rivian R1T is churning out 700 horsepower and a mind-boggling 826 lb-ft. of torque. This is good for a zero to 60 mph time of 3.2 seconds.
But if you’re planning to tear down the dragstrip in your Rivian R1T, go for the mid-range option with the 135 kWh battery pack. It has a maximum power output of 750 horsepower, which reaches 60 mph in three seconds flat and provides a range of 300 plus miles. When was the last time a gasoline or diesel truck came with so much power?
The “smallest” version of the Rivian R1T comes with a 105 kWh battery pack. This is good for 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft. of torque. But this version is no slouch, either. It can scoot to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds. All versions of the Rivian R1T have a top speed of 125 mph.
#5: Skateboard Platform: Stable & Secure
The Rivian R1T is built on a foundation the startup calls a Skateboard Platform. This means all the essential components (the battery pack, electric drive units, suspension, braking, and thermal management systems) are mounted below the height of each wheel.
“The beauty and elegance of our quad-motor setup isn’t just about brute power,” explained Mark Vinnels, Executive Director of Engineering and Programs at Rivian. “This architecture provides instantaneous torque with extremely precise control at each wheel, which is completely game-changing from a dynamics perspective, both on- and off-road.”
Pricing & Availability
Rivian will build the R1T pickup and R1S SUV at their 2.6-million square-foot manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. Deliveries will begin in late 2020. Pricing for the Rivian R1T starts at $61,500 and $65,000 for the R1S after federal tax credits.

2018/12/12,Would You Drive This Vintage Aston Martin EV?,"Take your favorite classic car and fit it with a modern EV powertrain.
That’s exactly what Aston Martin has done with a 1970 DB6 MkII Volante.
The reversible “cassette” powertrain concept is still sympathetic to the original car.
Aston Martin’s Heritage models are now part of their overall electrification strategy.
Here’s a lovely idea, and I mean that both figuratively as well as literally. Take a cool old car, in this case an Aston Martin 1970 DB6 MkII Volante, take out the old drivetrain, and replace it with a completely new electric one. Not only is it an interesting engineering exercise, but a much more elegant EV than anything else currently on the road.
Aston Martin isn’t the first car company to do this. Jaguar produced a limited run of E-Types that were converted over to EVs. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry drove one from their wedding to the reception.
So, if anything, that shows you can teach an old dog new EV tricks.
Side A & Side B
Created as part of Aston’s wider EV strategy, this electric DB6, part of the Heritage electrification concept, was developed in-house at the Newport Pagnell Works. It is built around a so-called “cassette” EV powertrain, meaning all the electrical stuff “plugs in” to where the old ICE stuff used to. Since it’s nearly a plug-and-play deal, you can take out all the EV gear and put back that silky, smooth straight six vintage Astons are known for. In other words, Aston Martin has future-proofed these exquisite machines by creating the world’s first reversible EV powertrain conversion.
Aston Martin started this project during the final development phase of the Rapide E, the EV version of their four door luxo sedan. Work on the Rapide E also dovetailed into planning for the new range of Lagondas, as well as the Aston Martin Works’ Heritage EV conversions.
By using this approach, Aston really thinks they’re on to something.
[bctt tweet=”@astonmartin shows us you can teach an old dog new EV tricks.” username=”Automoblog”]
First Recorded Version
A 1970 DB6 MkII Volante, first hand-crafted at Newport Pagnell, is the first to receive the new cassette system, although the original engine and gearbox mountings are still in place. Enclosed within its own self-contained cell, umbilical cords from the power unit feed the car’s various electrical systems. Power management (i.e. how much juice and range you have) is taken and monitored through a new screen in the cockpit.
However, since this is not just an Aston Martin, but a vintage Aston Martin, that screen is “discreetly fitted to the car’s interior.”
RELATED

Contemporary Yet Vintage
Aston was very picky, meaning the EV conversion should support the integrity of the original car. Aston Martin feels this trick cassette system offers the perfect solution, future-proofing the car in a socially responsible way, yet still being a genuine Aston Martin; with the option of returning its original powertrain if preferred.
Given the historical significance of these collector cars, it’s hard to argue with this philosophy.
And yes, in case you’re interested (and have the cash) this is most definitely not a one off. Now that they are done with this proof-of-concept DB6 Volante, Aston Martin Works’ will move forward with more customer Heritage EV conversions. They are expected to start sometime in 2019.
Negative Energy
There are, of course, downsides to this. Cost is the first one. Any Aston Martin is not cheap, especially old ones, and future cars like this DB6 Volante will likely cost you a pretty penny. The other downside is that even though this is an electric vehicle, it was not designed and built around where battery packs would go.
So the number of batteries, and hence, the all up range of these things, probably won’t be as good as a car designed from the ground up as an EV.
Positive Vibes
The real upside, though, is that if Aston Martin can do this, so could other car companies. I have long advocated this. Take the early 60s Kennedy Continentals. Big, massive, stylish – the perfect candidate for going with a full EV conversion. The trunks are huge (for a start). You can easily fit four Jimmy Hoffas in there. If you line the floor with batteries, you’d still have lots of room left over.
Weight? Who cares! Stock those things weigh two-and-a-half tons, so how bad could adding a slew of batteries make it. And throw some up in that yawning engine bay while you’re at it. Electric motors don’t take up much space, right?
Now Imagine This . . .
If it were up to me, every car company worth its steel would be doing this. Imagine roads with EV Chevy Nomads and shoebox Fords, Chrysler Imperials, and Jag Mark 2s – only EVs! Silently wooshing down our streets and being demonstrably better cars than Nissan Leafs on class alone.
Until then, all I can say is thank you Aston Martin.

2018/12/12,"2019 Ford Ranger Production Ongoing, Fuel Economy Figures Revealed","2019 Ford Ranger production is underway in Michigan.
Horsepower and fuel economy figures are now available.
Pricing begins at $25,395 when the new Ranger arrives next month.   
2019 Ford Ranger production is underway at Michigan Assembly. After an eight year absence, the Ranger returns for the 2019 model year. Ford has invested $850 million into Michigan Assembly for both the Ranger and Bronco, the latter set for production in 2020.
“The revitalization of the Michigan Assembly Plant and renewed production of the Ford Ranger is another exciting chapter in our state’s comeback story,” said Governor Rick Snyder. “This is also an opportunity to look toward its promising future with production of the all-new Ford Bronco on the horizon.”
“Ford truck fans demanded a midsize pickup that’s ‘Built Ford Tough,’ and we’re delivering with our all-new Ranger that’s specially designed and engineered for American truck customers,” added Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s President of Global Operations. “At the same time, we’re revitalizing our Michigan Assembly Plant and securing good-paying jobs for our hourly employees here in the U.S.”
New Family
Ford is transforming their product lineup, building their truck, SUV, and commercial vehicle momentum. Earlier this year, Michigan Assembly ended Focus production, taking the necessary retooling measures in anticipation for the Ranger’s launch. The 2019 Ranger is the first in a series of all-new vehicles as Ford looks to replace over 75 percent of their North American portfolio by 2020.
“We have been waiting for this day for a long time,” said Michigan Assembly Plant Manager Erik Williams. “The Ranger is back home in the U.S., and our employees at Michigan Assembly Plant are thrilled to be able to build it for our customers.”
Power & Performance
The Ranger’s 2.3-liter EcoBoost features a twin-scroll turbocharger, forged-steel crankshaft (and con rods), and chain-driven dual overhead cams. It’s paired to a 10-speed automatic and creates 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. of torque. When properly equipped, the 2019 Ford Ranger has a 7,500 lbs. towing capacity and a payload capacity of 1,860 lbs.
EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings come in at 21/26 city/highway and 23 combined for 4×2 trucks. As a 4×4, fuel economy ratings are 20/24 city/highway and 22 combined.
An available FX4 Off-Road Package includes Terrain Management and Trail Control systems to increase performance during adverse or rough driving conditions.
Trailer Profiles
The 2019 Ford Ranger can store up to three trailer profiles, including a trailer’s length. This lets the radar system know how far back to provide warnings as vehicles approach the trailer. Ford says such a system is class-exclusive and not available on any other midsize pickup.

Trim Levels & Availability
Trims include the entry-level XL, mid-level XLT, and high-level Lariat, with available Chrome and Sport appearance and FX Off-Road packages. The 2019 Ford Ranger will come in a SuperCab or SuperCrew configuration when it arrives at dealers next month.
“UAW-Ford members take pride in relaunching the all-new Ranger right here in Michigan,” said UAW-Ford Vice President Rory Gamble. “Our UAW brothers and sisters take great care in the quality and craftsmanship customers will discover when they experience the relaunch of this iconic nameplate.”
“I thank our partners at Ford for investing in Michigan and contributing to the Motor City’s legacy as the automotive capital of the world,” Snyder added.

2018/12/10,2020 Lincoln Aviator: When Luxury Vehicles & Cheese Graters Collide,"The 2020 Lincoln Aviator is all about luxury, safety technology, and performance. 
Lincoln Driver Modes, Phone As A Key, and Co-Pilot360 Plus are among the top features.
We’re not sold on the styling but the 2020 Lincoln Aviator has lots of redeeming qualities.  
Wow, where to start with the 2020 Lincoln Aviator? Well, first off, it looks like a cross between a bank vault and a cheese grater, and a very angry cheese grater at that. It has the on-road presence of a Panzer tank, and all the creature comforts of a 12,000 square foot McMansion. In short, it’s just what a certain segment of the American car buying public wants.
Lincoln will probably sell them by the boatload.
Suburban Mainstays
Maybe it’s just where I live, but I’ve been seeing a lot of Lincolns around for a while now. The same could be said when I was interned in Arizona. Sure, down there, there’s tons of retirees, and that demographic loves its big American cars. But Lincoln, a company on its deathbed as long as its namesake, seems to be entering some sort of resurgence these days. So like I said, you’ll probably be seeing more of these large, stately, borderline-ugly things tooling around shopping malls and burbclaves and such in a couple of years.
The 2020 Lincoln Aviator hit the stage at this year’s LA Auto Show, with Lincoln noting that their “three-row midsize (ha!) premium SUV” is aimed at the highest volume segment in the United States: the midsize luxury market. They also, rightly, point out how this is also the “third-highest volume segment in China.”
Hmmm? Export plans much?
[bctt tweet=”It looks like a cross between a bank vault and a cheese grater.” username=”Automoblog”]
Power & Performance: A Healthy Dose
You’d expect the Aviator to be powered by a big ‘Murican V8, but no, the powertrain choices are actually rather sensible and efficient. The standard engine is a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6, hooked up to a 10-speed SelectShift automatic. As such you get a notable 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft. of torque. Impressive for only three-liters. The optional powertrain is that same twin-turbocharged engine connected to a hybrid drive system. Lincoln says it gets you 450 horsepower and a colossal 600 lb-ft. of torque. Yes please!
There’s no word on MPG figures for either engine, but with 600 lb-ft. of torque, I’m willing to wait, then completely forget.
The drivetrain is controlled via this scheme referred to as “Lincoln Drive Modes.” There are five “signature” settings: Normal, Conserve, Excite, Slippery, and Deep Conditions; then for 2020, two new modes: Pure EV and Preserve EV. As the names imply, these two new modes allow drivers to choose how and when to best use their electric energy from the hybrid system.
Related: Big and loaded with luxury: our full review of the 2018 Lincoln Navigator.
Convenience & Safety: Digital Keys & Driver Assist Systems
Naturally, the tech doesn’t stop there. The suspension system automatically lowers the vehicle to “greet” the driver and turns on the signature welcome lighting. Lincoln’s “Phone As A Key” means you can lock and unlock, open the liftgate, adjust seat, mirror and steering positions, and, ta-DAH, start and drive the vehicle without a traditional key. And, if you’re gullible enough to loan out your Aviator, the technology allows up to four “keys” for each vehicle.
RELATED

The 2020 Lincoln Aviator has a gizmo that lets it “see” potholes or uneven pavement, adjusting the suspension as it does. Lincoln calls it Adaptive Suspension with Road Preview.
The Co-Pilot360 feature includes multiple assist systems as standard equipment. Traffic Jam Assist, for example, contains adaptive cruise control for stop-and-go traffic, lane centering, and traffic sign recognition. Evasive Steer Assist helps avoid collisions with a slower or stopped vehicle; Reverse Brake Assist will stop the Aviator from backing into something, and Active Park Assist Plus guides you into parallel and perpendicular parking spaces.
Comfort & Connectivity: Luxury Car Levels of Both
Other comfort and convenience features abound inside the 2020 Lincoln Aviator. The Revel Ultima 3D Audio System contains 28 speakers, while the steering wheel recognizes subtle thumb movements for accessing numerous functions and commands. The seats offer 30-way adjustability, massage, and additional lumbar support for drivers and passengers. The second-row seats recline, adjust fore and aft, and slide forward for access to the third row.
Other such features include wireless phone charging in the center armrest, a handy media bin, multiple power outlets throughout, and a standard Wi-Fi hotspot.
Pricing & Availability
In many ways, you can think of the 2020 Lincoln Aviator as your home away from the retirement home; the perfect vehicle to get you from your gated community in Scottsdale or Boca Raton, down to the golf and racket club. And back in butter smooth comfort, quietly and safely.
Expect the new Aviator next summer with pricing information due closer to that time.

2018/12/08,2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO: Affalterbach’s Hurricane,"The 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO emerges as the latest in the AMG GT line. 
The two-door AMG GT Coupes and Roadsters come with a unique driving control system.
Mercedes-AMG says everything about the new GT R PRO was modified for track performance. 
I’m starting to think Mercedes is just messing with us now, especially when it comes to anything with the AMG badge glued to it. The German’s engineering prowess and cultural depth of knowledge is so profound, it’s like trying to argue with Wotan. “Oh, is that what you think,” comes the stentorian voice, booming from the clouds, “Then behold mortal! Witness the AMG GT!”
And now, witness the 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO.
Delivering The Goods
Yes, Mercedes-Benz is kind of stodgy and conservative in a engineering sense. They lack the design finesse and penchant for experimentality of Ferrari; have nowhere near the impudent glee of Porsche, or the British refinement and reserve of Aston Martin, but Land O’Goshen can they deliver the goods. The goods, in this case, being grip and braking and power; lots and lots and lots of power.
Driving anything hot off the line from AMG means you know what Günther Rall must have felt rolling in on a stream of B-17s over Frankfurt.
Expanding The Family
In an odd way, Mercedes-Benz seems intent on making the GT a sub-brand within the AMG sub-brand itself, sort of a sub-sub-brand. There are, in point of fact, three Mercedes AMG GTs: The Mercedes-AMG GT, the Mercedes-AMG GTC (which is a four door “coupe”), and the Mercedes-AMG GT R/Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO. The latter are twin track terrors with the luxo stuff taken out and speed stuff added.
The 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT R PRO was even inspired by the AMG GT3 and AMG GT4 race cars.
“No other current production Mercedes- AMG is as close to motor racing as the new AMG GT R PRO,” said Tobias Moers, Chairman of the Management Board of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. “A lot of experience from our current GT3 and GT4 motorsport activities entered into its development.”
Where we are at in 2020 with these GTs is a place of refinement, of constant honing of this, sharpening of that, trimming of this bit einfach so, of that bit nur ein bisschen mehr.
Dynamic Controls: A Testament To Refinement
A good example is the AMG Dynamics portion of the AMG Dynamic Select drivetrain/chassis control system. Along with the standard modes (Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus, Race, and Individual), AMG Dynamics also broadens the functions of the electronic stability control.
RELATED
Rock Me Amadeus: Will The 2021 Cadillac Escalade Have The Chops?
AMG Dynamics has four modes: Basic, Advanced, Pro, and Master. No laughing mortal! Displease Wotan and suffer the consequences! Basic works with the Slippery and Comfort drive programs for stable handling and higher yaw damping. Advanced is coupled with the Sport program for more neutral balance and lower yaw damping. With a reduction in the “steering angle requirements,” the Advanced mode is perfect for winding country roads.
Pro is part of the Sport+ program and provides even more assistance than the Advanced mode does for those spirited driving sessions.
Master, which is only available for GT C and GT R, connects to the Race drive program. Master mode is aimed at those of us driving around on race tracks. This gives the GT an extreme neutral balance and an even lower steering angle. Master ensures the utmost agility and fully exploits the GT’s dynamic potential.
Suspension Tech: All About Wear Resistance
Of course the coil-over suspension got tweaked. Drivers can set the spring preload length mechanically, but the compression and rebound of the shocks is variable. This is done without tools via a click system with an integrated adjustment dial on the damper. You can even set the compression rate separately for high-speed or low-speed driving. The front axle now has a carbon fiber torsion bar while the rear is made of steel. Both are adjustable, natch.
The lower wishbones of the rear axle have Uniball spherical rod-end bearings. They are considerably more wear-resistant than conventional bearings and their design has no play, so toe-in and camber do not change even under high loads. Nasty!
“The agile responses to all driver commands and the overall performance now deliver even more of that incomparable feeling that our racing drivers experience on the track,” Moers said.
Carbon Fiber & Aerodynamic Treatments
There’s a carbon fiber shear panel in the underbody to help cut weight and increase overall precision. AMG even retuned the electronically-controlled engine and transmission mounts, a move they say increases agility and response. Along with the carbon-fiber components, the standard ceramic composite braking system also cuts weight.
Aerodynamics are enhanced with a re-designed front apron and two flics at the sides, clear-coated carbon fiber, of course. Air slots in the front fenders are for more than looks, venting the wheel arches and lowering front-axle lift.
Out back, there’s a clear-coated carbon-fiber aero bit at the wheel arch. The rear spoiler now has a lip for increased downforce as well.
Power & Performance: The Numbers Speak!
And there’s even more, all of which Mercedes-AMG goes into great detail on, but the only details that really matter are these: zero to 60 in the mid-3s and top speeds nudging the double ton. The next greatest detail is this: 7.04.632 minutes around the Nürburgring. AMG brand ambassador and AMG GT3 racing driver Maro Engel recorded the time.

2018/12/05,2019 Kia Niro EV: Like A Bank Vault That Makes Cool Noises,"The 2019 Kia Niro EV debuts at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show.
Expect quicker charging times and an abundance of safety features.
It even makes a futuristic noise that resembles a spaceship. No. Seriously. 
Electric vehicles are coming, and they’re coming for every price point and customer out there. What was once the province of rich people with a point to make, is now, or soon will be, within reach of even those of humble means. What Tesla is to guilt-ridden project managers, the Kia Niro EV will be to, uh, people who buy Kias.
Look, I have nothing against Tesla. They are very well made and very usable. The only thing I don’t like about Tesla is they’re expensive. Sure, in my Lotto-winning Mind Palace Garage Mahal, I’d have a couple of them, but now? No can do. Automotive writers don’t make much crust.
Not Just For The Super Rich
The Kia Niro EV, like the Nissan Leaf and other “budget-minded” EVs, want to rectify that. No firm pricing yet but c’mon, it’s a Kia. How much can they possibly charge? And even though it will not be Rolls-Royce priced, it is, like everything Kia makes, loaded with features of all sorts. Tech, comfort, convenience, the lot.
What will differentiate it from its ICE-powered brethren is the powertrain, which is anything but cheap.
Related: Will Kia’s wireless EV charging system change the world?
Charge Up Over Lunch
The 2019 Kia Niro EV is powered by a state-of-the-art, liquid-cooled 64kWh lithium ion polymer battery that lives under the floor. Nice because there’s minimal passenger intrusion and a lower center of gravity. Charging rates are said to be brief. The prime mover is a 201 horsepower electric motor with an impressive 291 lb-ft. of torque.
Kia says the Combined Charging System (CCS) handlea a 100kW load, with the DC fast-charge equipment being standard. That means you can get around 100-miles of recharge in 30 minutes, or “fill up” 80 percent of the battery in 75 minutes (a long lunch).
If you’re pulling from a Level 2, 240v line (i.e. like the one your washer/dryer is hooked to) at 7.2 kWh, then you’re all charged up in 9.5 hours. So, park it for the night, plug it in, and you’ll be good to go for the following day.
Eco-Focused Driving
Yes, with 291 lb-ft. of torque, the driving can be fun. There are four drive modes you can choose from: Eco, Normal, Sport, and Eco+. These allow you to tailor stuff like the regenerative braking level, air and heat settings, and even speed for better efficiency.

For example, the regenerative braking system has four levels depending on how aggressive you want the regen effort. The Brake and Hold System brings the Niro to a full stop, adding energy to the battery otherwise lost under normal braking. Smart Regen creates smoother “coast-down driving,” especially on steep roads. The Smart Eco Pedal Guide is a nanny on the instrument cluster, keeping you aware of real-time power distribution based on accelerator pedal input.
Did You Hear That?
Kia even threw in a “techy whirring noise” when moving to evoke a speedy sci-fi spacecraft. No, seriously. One early tester confessed to driving in parking garages with the windows down just so they could hear the sound. The sound, however, is actually the Pedestrian Warning System, a speaker and controller assembly behind the front bumper.
Without it, the Niro EV would be silent and a potential hazard to pedestrians.
Tech & Connectivity: Plenty To Go Around
Besides the EV parts, this Niro is what you’d expect out of any modern car: tons of tech and tons of safety stuff. There’s a seven-inch color touchscreen with a rearview camera and parking guidance. Tunes come from an eight-speaker Harman/Kardon premium audio system.
There’s a USB input along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Wireless smart phone charging and Bluetooth connectivity with voice recognition, all standard.
Other bits of flash include the “high-tech” rotary shifter dial, customizable “mood” lighting, a multi-functional center console with many (many) storage options, cup holders, compartments, and three USB ports. A deluxe scuff plate finishes off the blingee.

Safety? Like A Bank Vault!
Antilock braking, traction control, electronic stability control, hill-start assist control, and a tire pressure monitoring system for starters. There’s the “Kia Drive Wise” suite with with forward collision warning, forward collision-avoidance assist, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, blind spot collision warning, driver attention warning, smart cruise control with stop & go, rear cross-traffic collision warning, and parking distance warning.
Finally, the 2019 Kia Niro EV has a revamped telematics system so you can monitor and control a long list of vehicle operations. This includes things like battery and charging status, scheduled charging, and real-time charging station updates.
If Kia didn’t tell you this is an EV, you’d never notice. Apart from that spaceship sound thingo, which is kinda goofy.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Kia Niro EV will be available in two trims, EX and EX Premium, and will go on sale early next year. Pricing information is forthcoming.

2018/12/05,2020 Jeep Gladiator: The Warrior Emerges,"The 2020 Jeep Gladiator sends a clear message to the competition. 
However, this is not the first time we have seen the Gladiator namesake. 
Join us for a brief walk through history, then an in-depth look at the 2020 Jeep Gladiator. 
The debut of Miracle on 34th Street. Christian Dior’s “New Look” for women. The Doomsday Clock. Chuck Yeager flies faster than sound and David Bowie is born. 1947 was a year of firsts. On the automotive front, Army veteran John C. Hennessy Jr. brings the first Volkswagen Beetle to the United States after purchasing it from the U.S. Army Post Exchange in Frankfurt, Germany. That same year, the Ferrari 125 S, with its V12 engine, becomes the first car to bear Enzo’s name.
And Willys Overland introduced a one-ton truck with four-wheel drive based on the CJ-2A.
They say history repeats itself. They say the more things change, the more they stay the same. That’s true if we consider the 2020 Jeep Gladiator. In fact, this isn’t the first time the Gladiator has stepped in the arena.
The Warrior Emerges
In his book, Jeep: The History of America’s Greatest Vehicle, Patrick R. Foster details how, by the fourth quarter of 1962, Jeep’s new line of wagons and pickups were selling like hotcakes. The Wagoneer and the Gladiator were firsts for the automotive world, with the Gladiator becoming, in Foster’s words, a “handsome brute of a pickup truck that would bring Jeep into direct competition with the Big Three makers.”
Consider the current Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon; the Honda Ridgeline and Toyota Tacoma, and the return of the Ford Ranger. With the Gladiator, Jeep is again putting the competition in their crosshairs. As they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
Jeep of All Trades
The Wagoneer’s styling, conceived by then Willys Styling head Jim Angers, made it appear larger than it really was. Arguably, the Wagoneer was a percursor to today’s modern crossover. The Gladiator shared the same engineering DNA and options were plentiful. Buyers could select from 1/2, 3/4, or one-ton configurations in either two or four-wheel drive. Body styles included Thriftside, Townside, Platform Stake, or cab and chassis; there were two wheelbases (120 and 126-inch) and a bed length of either seven or eight feet.
Power steering, power brakes, and a GVWR up to 8,600 lbs. – indeed, the Gladiator of the 1960s was an impressive machine. And by all accounts the 2020 Jeep Gladiator is an impressive machine too. But to what degree? Let’s break it down with an in-depth look.
Styling & Design: History Meets Performance
The design team sought to balance a storied history with modern performance. For example, the Gladiator has Jeep’s distinctive seven-slot grille, each “slot” representing one of the world’s seven continents. Every Jeep of every type has this grille, paying homage to Jeep’s capability on all seven continents.
However, as far as the 2020 Gladiator is concerned, the slots become wider to increase air intake, while the top is swept back slightly in the interest of aerodynamics.
Body & Chassis: Longer & Lighter
Body-on-frame design here, and probably not surprising considering what we are looking at. In general, the body and chassis play a major role in a vehicle’s safety, fuel economy, ride and handling and, in this case, off-road ability. Jeep enthusiasts want a solid foundation under them – why else drive a Jeep? So the 2020 Gladiator needs to ace this test, but how?

Out of the gate, engineers went for a light and rigid high-strength steel frame. Keep in mind, trucks are trucks and Jeeps are Jeeps, but this is a Jeep truck. Thus, some modification was necessary.
Take the Jeep Wrangler 4-door, for example. By comparison, Gladiator’s frame is 31 inches longer while the wheelbase is 19.4 inches longer. Yet, the longer wheelbase and the bed’s positioning relative to the rear axle make for better weight distribution. This also facilitates a more comfortable ride when towing or hauling cargo, according to Jeep. Furthermore, the prop shaft, brake and fuel lines, and the exhaust system were lengthened to accommodate the new architecture.
Elsewhere, the 2020 Jeep Gladiator employs high-strength aluminum for the doors, door hinges, hood, fender flares, windshield frame, tailgate, and engine mounts.
[bctt tweet=”Keep in mind, trucks are trucks and Jeeps are Jeeps, but this is a Jeep truck. Thus, some modification was necessary.” username=”Automoblog”]
Body & Chassis: Protection Is Key, Convenience Too
Even a Jeep truck will do Jeep things, meaning underbody protection is paramount. Slide under on the mechanic’s creeper and notice Gladiator’s four robust skid plates and bars to protect the fuel tank, transfer case, and transmission oil pan. Rubicon models go further, employing heavy gauge tubular steel rock rails.
Moving then to the five-foot bed, there are four steel cross-members to reinforce the load floor.
In-bed tie-downs and lighting, and an optional external power source help with cargo hauling. Spray-in bed liners, bed dividers, and tonneau covers are also available. Finally, the power-locking tailgate can stop in three different positions.
Suspension Setup: It’s A Jeep Thing
One complaint is how Jeeps ride like noisy lumber wagons. And the response is, appropriately enough, “duh, it’s a Jeep. It’s supposed to be rugged.” However, Jeep’s engineers worked to soften the ride and lower cabin noise for those longer road trips.
As far as brick and mortar components, they make sense for a Jeep truck. The five-link coil suspension has the front employing a lateral control arm and four longitudinal control arms. Full-width, forged steel track bars control lateral movement of the axle, with minimal angle change, during suspension travel. The rear five-link coil suspension features two upper and two lower forged steel control arms for longitudinal control. Similar to the front, the rear track bar provides lateral support.
The rear control arms are located under of the frame rails, while the rear shocks are forward facing. This provides consistent damping for ride comfort, especially when traveling with a payload. Interestingly enough, no other Jeep but the new Gladiator employs this type of rear suspension design.
Overall, Jeep says they went for an optimum balance between off-road handling in the sticks and comfort for those Sunday drives. Engineers, however, paid special attention to the shock tuning, hard points, and body mounts.
Off-Road Prowess: Duh, It’s A Jeep
Whatever does one do with a Jeep? If you said something about off-roading, a chicken dinner is in your future. As sure as Reese’s will honor peanut butter and the Yankees their pinstripes, Jeep – even a Jeep truck – will honor the off-road.
The 2020 Jeep Gladiator provides two 4×4 systems. The Command-Trac 4×4 system (Sport and Overland) has a two-speed transfer case with a 2.72:1 low-range gear ratio, and heavy-duty Dana 44 front and rear axles with a 3.73 rear axle ratio. On Gladiator Rubicon, a Rock-Trac 4×4 system features Dana 44 front and rear axles with a “4LO” ratio of 4:1. The 4.10 front and rear axle ratio is bolstered by Tru-Lok locking differentials.

Both Command-Trac and Rock-Trac systems offer full-time torque management for low-traction situations. An available Trac-Lok limited-slip rear differential on Sport and Overland provides extra torque and grip when driving over sand, gravel, and snow. Gladiator Rubicons go a bit farther, offering an electronic sway-bar disconnect and 33-inch tires. Crawl ratios for the Gladiator Rubicon come in at 84.2:1 with the manual transmission and 77.2:1 with the automatic.
When the trip goes way off-road, the 2020 Jeep Gladiator provides 30 inches of water fording. Gladiator’s approach angle is 43.6 degrees; breakover angle 20.3 degrees; departure angle 26 degrees, with a ground clearance in excess of 11 inches. Bring on the weekend!

Engine & Powertrain: Big Diesel Power
FCA’s multi-platform engine, the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, is standard fare for the 2020 Jeep Gladiator. The Pentastar delivers a respectable 285 horsepower, 260 lb-ft. of torque, and offers a generous power band. However, the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel is a better option for those who want more low end. Available starting in 2020, the EcoDiesel cranks out 442 lb-ft. of torque and 260 horsepower.
The EcoDiesel’s power emanates from the on-board turbo and its low-friction bearings.
An eight-speed automatic is standard for the EcoDiesel and optional for the Pentastar V6. With two overdrive ratios to improve highway fuel economy and reduce NVH, the eight-speed automatic will likely be the top choice. However, a six-speed manual is available for the Pentastar V6, with gear ratios set for crawl performance.
When properly equipped, the 2020 Jeep Gladiator tows 7,650 lbs. with a payload capacity of 1,600 lbs.
Other Cool Stuff
More than 80 active and passive safety and security features are available.
A four-bolt design at the top of the windshield’s frame allows it to fold down.
All Gladiators feature body-color sport bars with grab handles for front occupants.
The shifter, grab handles, and the infotainment screen’s frame are accented by real bolts.
The full-size spare tire and mount is located under the bed and can hold up to a 35-inch tire.
A tool kit with the necessary Torx bits to remove the doors and lower the windshield is included.
Cloth or leather-contoured seats feature accent stitching and adjustable bolster and lumbar support.
Gladiator Rubicon has a forward-facing off-road camera nestled between the front grille’s middle slot.
Availability & Manufacturing
When it arrives in the second quarter of 2019, the Gladiator will come in Sport, Sport S, Overland, and Rubicon trims. In addition, Mopar will offer over 200 performance parts and accessories for the new Gladiator. Production will commence at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Toledo, Ohio, Jeep’s manufacturing home since 1941.

2018/12/02,2019 Toyota RAV4: Right Size Fits All,"The 2019 Toyota RAV4 line includes both gasoline and hybrid models.
The new RAV4 is built on Toyota’s TNGA-K platform for a lower center of gravity.
For those on the go, the 2019 RAV4 has plenty of infotainment and safety features.
I read recently that over 60 percent of new cars sold are SUVs and trucks. That explains why you see so many of them around; people want them. That also explains why GM, for example, is closing down lines, because sales of sedans are way down. That also explains why the latest RAV4 from Toyota is such a big deal.
They’re going to sell a lot of them.
Right Size Fits All
What Toyota, and every other player in the (crowded) SUV field has to do, is hit a sweet spot. SUVs have to be trucks, but not too truck-like. They have to be big, but not the size of a semi. They have to be practical, but still have style. That’s probably why Toyota sells so many RAV4s – they’re pretty much all of that.
So, of course, for 2019, you can expect more of the same – only different!
Let’s start with the drivetrain, because there’s a lot going on there.
Use The Force
The 2019 Toyota RAV4 is powered by the hysterically-named “Dynamic Force” 2.5-liter inline-four-banger. The engine, matched to an eight-speed automatic, has a near-diesel like compression ratio: 13:1 on gas models and 14:1 on Atkinson cycle HV (hybrid) models. There are other tricks, like D4-S fuel injection (combining direct and secondary port injectors), high-speed combustion, and variable valve timing.
This all adds up to 203 ponies, which is a pretty good output. 60 mph comes up in a respectable 8.2 seconds. Pretty slick for a “truck.” The HV models – billed as the “sporty hybrid grade” by Toyota – hit 60 in 7.8 seconds. For those who want something a little more agile, the XSE HV has a sport-tuned suspension.
That four-banger option seems like a pretty good choice, but the real flashy stuff happens with the RAV4 Hybrid. That model has the engine paired with Toyota’s Hybrid System II and an electronically-controlled Continuously-Variable Transmission. All that mechanical tech tallies up an impressive mpg rating of 41/37/39 (city, highway, combined.) Active grille shutters further enhance fuel economy.
See, impressive!
Powertrain & Safety Tech
Optional for the 2019 Toyota RAV4 is all-wheel drive and torque vectoring. The system directs up to 50 percent of the torque to the rear wheels, and can slew it left or right to enhance handling. Another nicety is the Rear Driveline Disconnect system for better fuel mileage on long haul highway trips. Multi-Terrain Select gives you the ability to climb over mud, sand, rocks, dirt, and snow.

Nifty features like Hill Start Assist Control, Trailer Sway Control, and Downhill Assist Control are also found on the 2019 Toyota RAV4. There’re safety nannies aplenty to help prevent collisions or mitigate their impacts. Everything from pre-collision and pedestrian warnings to radar cruise control, lane assist, and rear cross traffic braking – the whole megillah.
Related: The RAV4 Adventure has extra features that set it apart. Here is our full review.
Sound Reduction
Sound-damping and soundproofing materials have been enhanced throughout the 2019 Toyota RAV4, with a particular focus on minimizing any noise that might interfere with conversation in the cabin. Holes and gaps between parts have also been filled with sound-damping material. For example, the floor silencer pad is now one large piece; its surface area increasing from 60 percent coverage to 92 percent.
Steering & Handling
The new parallel-type electric power steering system is rack-mounted rather than column-mounted, as opposed to the previous model. Toyota says the new design helps enhance turning response and even reduces fatigue on long drives. Higher rigidity in the steering mounting and column further enhance responsiveness and feel, according to Toyota.
Other tidbits include larger over-fenders, and a more aggressive bumper and grille design. 19-inch, split five-spoke wheels with “Adventure grade” tires are available.
Related: The Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is ideal for those who commute everyday.
Interior Treatments
There’s lots of tech perks on the inside too. Entune 3.0 multimedia, including Wi-Fi Connect powered by Verizon, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple CarPlay. So I guess you can order cat litter by voice command while driving? Okay. Unfortunately to do that, you will have to turn down the available 800-watt JBL audio system.
Across the entire model line, the latest RAV4 is full of convenience stuff, like a 4.2-inch multi-information screen, auxiliary power outlets, USB charging ports, reading lights, and cargo area lights. The exterior mirrors come with LED turn signals and blind spot warning indicators; there is even a moonroof.
Pricing & Availability
Gas 2019 Toyota RAV4 models come in five grades: LE, XLE, XLE Premium, Adventure, and Limited. By contrast, the Hybrid will come in LE, XLE, XSE, and Limited. All this goodness starts around $27,000 bucks for the gas models, stopping around $37,000 for the hybrids. Which, you’ve got to admit, is a pretty good value.

2018/12/01,"2019 Porsche Macan: Smaller, Quicker & Reasonably Priced","The 2019 Porsche Macan has a ton of connectivity features, including an off-road recorder. 
On dry pavement, however, the new Macan has a respectable zero to 60 time.
But is it too small? Or just right?  
In theory, if you’re dragged, kicking and screaming, into SUV ownership, it’s a Porsche you’re going to buy, right? I mean they should be, theoretically, the most car-like and fun to drive. Or at least that’s what Cayenne owners tell me. If that’s the case, than shouldn’t the Porsche Macan, the Cayenne’s baby brother, be even better since it’s smaller and lighter?
Yes, by that way of looking at it, it should. But . . .
Urban Cruiser
Here’s where we get into a crossing point for usability over drivability. If all you wanted was something practical and fun, you’d get something smaller, like a VW GTi 4-door. But that would be too small. So, is the 2019 Porsche Macan too small to be practical?
In short, no. Or at least no in most cases most of the time. Sure, you don’t have as much space as the bigger Cayenne, but the smaller footprint of the Macan makes it better if you’re in a primarily urban environment.
Styling & Color Options
For 2019, the most noticeable changes are the new “three-dimensional” LED light panel at the rear, the now standard LED headlights, and the overhauled interior. Porsche’s Dynamic Light System Plus is still available, which gives you better visibility while cornering. New paint colors include Mamba Green Metallic, Dolomite Silver Metallic, Miami Blue, and Chalk.
That green is a particularly lovely shade, by the way.
Pouring On The Tech
The 2019 Porsche Macan gets a larger, 10.9-inch full HD touchscreen with the latest version of Porsche Communication Management (PCM). Drivers can customize the interface with movable tiles and by choosing their favorite functions from a list of options. The new system features online navigation, Porsche Connect Plus with an LTE phone module and SIM card reader, and a WLAN hotspot. That Porsche Connect app lets you communicate with your Macan via the smartphone in your pocket.
Up-to-date online navigation data is available via a connection to HERE Cloud for route calculation. Apple CarPlay is optional. Other options include a heated windshield and an air ionizer for the inside.
Also new is the Traffic Jam Assist function, which links to the optional adaptive cruise control. This allows the Macan to accelerate, brake, and keep itself within a marked lane up to 40 mph. Slick! The Offroad Precision app records any off-road experiences you have.
Related: The Porsche 911 Speedster Concept keeps teasing us.
Power & Performance
However, this is a Porsche. So, let’s get down to it. If it’s a Porsche, it’s all about dat engine, baby! The 2019 Macan comes with a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder turbocharged plant with 248 horsepower and 273 lb-ft. of torque. That’s hooked up to a seven-gear PDK dual-clutch gearbox, which all adds up to a pretty impressive zero to 60 time of 6.1 seconds with Launch Control. Top “track” speed is 142 mph.

2018/11/30,2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible: You Won’t Believe The Center Console,"The 2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible hits 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.  
The Z-fold roof provides a three decibel noise reduction; the chassis is 20 percent lighter.
Despite the luxury, performance, and technology we still cannot get over the center console.  
Let’s get right to the point. Are you filthy rich? Are you so rich that if, say, you’re crazy, shallow trophy wife (let’s call her Daisy) were to, oh, run over and crush a woman named Myrtle that you’ve been having an affair with for a while, you could buy your way out of it without breaking much of a sweat?
Then buddy, have I got a car for you: The 2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible!
Digging For Gold
Look, I’m not obsessively anti-rich or anything. But I’m having a devil of a time figuring out why someone would buy a car like the 2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible. It has everything a person could want in a production luxury car: style, technology, power, refinement, gorgeous materials, all that stuff.
It’s the flash I don’t completely understand.
The Conti Convertible is just so affectedly showy, so over the top in what it’s trying to present to the world, that even Kanye West would look at it and say, “Nah, that’s a little too much, don’t ya think?” And the Saudi prince, you know, the one with his own custom-made Boeing 747 as a private jet would answer, “yeah bruh, I know, right?” Maybe it’s just the top . . . it is made of tweed – a first for any car, which is kind of surprising, since you’d think some British company would have done that ages ago.
But apart from the pretension, the affectedness, and the flamboyance, what we have here is a pretty standard Bentley, circa 2019: tons of everything, and it’s very well screwed together.
300 Million Calculations Per Second
Let’s start with the first place everyone overlooks: The engine bay. Nestled within you’ll find Bentley’s 6.0-liter, W12 TSI engine, designed, developed, and hand-built in Crewe (if you ignore that Bentley is a VW subsidiary and variations of this plant can be found elsewhere in the line). Bentley says it is the “most advanced 12-cylinder engine in the world” to which, some guys in Maranello respond, “Tieni il mio chianti, amico.”
Said plant is controlled by a computer making 300 million software calculations per second.
The healthy 626 horsepower and 664 lb-ft. of torque throws this barge down the esplanade at substantial speeds. Zero to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, for example, with a top speed of 207. Impressive by any measure. And it becomes even more so when you figure this thing has got to weigh more than the HMS Ark Royal.

Although the 2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible is 20 percent lighter and five percent stiffer.
[bctt tweet=”Even Kanye West would look at it and say, Nah, that’s a little too much, don’t ya think?” username=”Automoblog”]
Transmission & Efficiency
The new engine utilizes start-stop technology, which is now mandatory in the Euro zone, yes? The engine also has Bentley’s Variable Displacement system that shuts down half of the engine. Intake and exhaust valves, fuel injection, and ignition are all cut on selected cylinders, with the mill running as a six-cylinder for better efficiency. The trans is a dual-clutch, eight-speed deal mated to a new “Active All-Wheel-Drive System” that varies the front-to-rear torque split, depending on the driving situation.
But enough about all that! Engines are dirty with grease and the province of the working classes (shudder). Here, step inside, have a seat. The interior of the 2019 Bentley Continental GT Convertible is like the drawing room at Highclere Castle.
Related: Not a sports car, but still fast: Meet the Bentley Continental GT.
All About Dat Center Console
The details are enough to choke a horse. For example, over 10 square meters of wood including Koa and Dark Fiddleback Eucalyptus wood as options. There are eight interior roof lining colors to choose from. The center console can be spec’d in a new Côtes de Genève finish, which is used for the surfacing inside Swiss watches. Each “row” of the center console, according to Bentley, is five millimeters wide and machined at an angle for a three-dimensional finish. Each “pass of the machine” makes a “minute step” of 0.5 millimeters.
This is the center console, y’know, where you put yer French fries. Sheesh.
Royal Treatment
And it just goes on and on from there. Haptic finishes, pillow knurling for the switches and controls, diamond knurling on other controls, 20-way adjustable seats, heating and massage functions for those seats, and signature Bentley quilting. The Naim 2,200 watt, 18-speaker system with Active Bass Transducers and eight sound modes ranges all the way from “symphonic” to “Pete Townshend’s Bleeding Eardrums.”
There’s a “Bentley Rotating Display” that provides a “digital or analogue” journey. A 12.3-inch MMI display (Audi!) resembles a smartphone with its configurable home screen.
Finally, the convertible roof opens and stows in about 20 seconds at speeds up to 30 mph.
Color Options & Pricing
All this and your choice of 17 colors. Oh, and that convertible roof? In addition to tweed, you get your choice of seven other colors. When picking out yours, I’m sure you’ll hear your shallow trophy wife exclaim something along the lines of “They’re such beautiful colors. It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such beautiful colors!”

2018/11/30,"Lamborghini Urus SUV Race Car? No, Really","The Lamborghini Urus SUV Race Car ushers in a new Motorsport program
The Urus racer is 25 percent lighter than its production counterpart.
You know Lamborghini is making an SUV now, right? It’s called the Urus and, besides it being a questionable move in every way but financial (they’ll sell them by the boatload, just watch), Lambo has come up with an idea that’s even goofier than making their own truck.
An all-Lambo SUV racing series.
No, they’re serious.
Squealing Tires & Mangled Carbon Fiber
At first, I thought this was some sort of monumentally sick joke. Then I slipped into a deep existential dread that a sports car company (even though it’s a sports car company as fundamentally compromised as Lamborghini) would even contemplate a truck racing series. But now, the more I think about it, the more this could turn into a real hootin’ hollerin’ good time!
Think of it: if they play it right, and only allow entries to be driven by housewives from Orange Country and plastic surgeons from Scarsdale, the on track action (and by action, I mean non-stop mistakes, over-driving, and completely preventable shunts) could be hysterically entertaining.
That tried and true combination of high power, high center of gravity, and high self-regard could equal squealing tires, concussive thumps, and mangled carbon fiber from the green flag till the checker.
Related: Lamborghini Urus: Everything wrong at just the right time.
Filthy, Stinkin’ Rich
At the 2018 World Finals, for their single make racing series, Lamborghini Squadra Corse unwrapped the Urus ST-X Concept. Their, uh, vision is a ride imagined for a single-brand racing championship that combines both a race circuit and an off-road track. Lambo made no mention if this “vision” was the result of Hunter S. Thompson levels of peyote ingestion combined with a frightening lack of sleep, but it sure sounds like it.
The new racing series will debut in 2020 both in Europe and the Middle East (lots o’cash floating around there). The competitors will race on specially-prepared and FIA-approved circuits, with the whole rich guy “arrive and drive” formula in place. Just hop in your Gulfstream Jet (you bourgeoisie jerk) fly to, oh, probably Dubai or some such place, and Lambo will have the complete package, including the car and technical support, all ready and waiting for the entire race weekend.

The Urus ST-X Concept is laid out in a matte Verde Mantis (i.e. screaming green) livery and the hood is in naked carbon fiber. The air intakes are larger and optimized for cooling the V8 twin-turbo plant. Said mill puts out 640 ponies and 627 lb-ft. of grunt.
Rear wing? Sure, why not? New hexagonal racing exhausts, and 21-inch single-nut aluminum alloy wheels, fitted with Pirelli tires, complete the visuals.
Compared to the production model, the Urus ST-X Concept drops 25 percent of its all up weight. Combined with an increase in torsional stiffening via the roll cage and a “raised set-up,” the Urus ST-X Concept is ready for the track. Or so says Lamborghini.
Heavy Metal Noise
Chances are the entire thing will be a circus sideshow, rather than some sort of racing to improve the breed situation. So why not go full circus? Grab a Kardashian or two (there seems to be a lot of them) a few rap moguls, burned out stadium rockers (what’s Sammy Hagar up to these days?), bone saw wielding Sheiks, and a few hedge fund managers and turn ’em loose!
Let’s go full on Ben-Hur!

2018/11/26,The 2019 Audi e-tron Will Make You Change Your Mind About EVs,"The 2019 Audi e-tron boasts a maximum range of over 300 miles.
Special drive modes give the e-tron an advantage over rough terrain.
Interestingly, the more conventional styling is what makes it stand out.   
The 2019 Audi e-tron made its debut in San Francisco in September. It’s a conventional-looking SUV with none of the styling quirks associated with electric cars. The Audi e-tron is sure to give the Tesla Model X and Jaguar E-PACE/I-PACE a serious run for the money, and I say that with no hint of sarcasm.
It’s quite refreshing for an electric vehicle to look like a normal car. The new Audi e-tron SUV might share the silhouette of the Q5, but there are subtle hints that set it apart. For example, the semi blanked-out octagon front grille and the four horizontal slats on the edge of the headlights, which resemble a smartphone’s battery charging bars.
One thing is for sure, though: the styling of the 2019 Audi e-tron is best appreciated in the flesh.
Move Over Tesla Model X!
I am a big fan of Tesla and Elon Musk. It’s one of those stories where the underdog came out the winner. Musk and Tesla EVs were able to change how consumers perceive the styling, performance, and features of an electric car. I also think the Tesla Model X is one of the best sport-utility vehicles currently in production.
But when the 2019 Audi e-tron arrived, it suddenly became clear. Not because Tesla now has a solid and proper competitor, but Audi was able to beat their Germans contemporaries in the fully-electric SUV segment, ahead of say the Mercedes-Benz EQ C. But what really surprises me with the new Audi e-tron is the restraint.
Remember when the Audi R8 was unveiled at the 2006 Paris Motor Show? It was unlike anything I have seen before. The R8, back then, looked like a spacecraft of alien origin. There was no hint of restraint in the styling.
On the flipside, the new Audi e-tron looks pretty much like a normal, everyday-driven SUV. And that’s a nice thing to have in an EV, right? I know some people enjoy the attention as they drop their kids at school or soccer practice in a Tesla Model X (what with those unusual yet magnificent falcon doors). However, the Audi e-tron will allow you to simply move on without gathering unsolicited stares.
Aerodynamic & Electrified Performance
No, you don’t get falcon doors on the 2019 Audi e-tron. But you get state-of-the-art virtual side mirrors. This feature is more than just a gimmick. Chopping off the side mirrors on both sides actually allows the e-tron to slice the wind more effortlessly. The system utilizes small cameras and door mounted displays in place of conventional mirrors. The bad news is this feature is only available in Europe and a few other markets, but it’s still a neat party trick.

Polestar Precept: Science Fiction or Something More?
The beating heart of the 2019 Audi e-tron is comprised of two electric motors. The combined output is 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft. of torque (265 kilowatts and 561 Newton meters by comparison). The electric motors can increase power and torque output in Boost mode for eight seconds. In that span of time, the Audi e-tron is churning out 402 horsepower and 490 lb-ft. of torque.
Those numbers are not enough to beat the Tesla Model X, right? Even if the 2019 Audi e-tron can scoot to 60 mph in around 5.5 seconds, the base Model X 75D can achieve the feat in 4.9 seconds. The Tesla is admittedly faster and more performance-oriented. But if you think again, you don’t need supercar-amounts of power to have a good time inside an electric SUV.
Superior Driving Range
Powering the pair of asynchronous motors is a lithium-ion battery pack rated at 95 kWh, enough for a maximum range of 310 miles (498 kilometers) when fully charged. The battery pack can be charged using either a 150 kWh DC fast-charging station or 9.6 kW AC 240-volt residential charger. The former refills the batteries with 80 percent juice in 30 minutes while the latter charges the battery pack overnight.
Road trip? No sweat. The Audi e-tron supports more than 500 Electrify America fast-charging networks nationwide. The network currently spans 40 states and 17 metro areas with more coming in the next couple of years.
This means the 2019 Audi e-tron can take you further than a Tesla Model X 70D for a lower starting price. The base Audi e-tron Premium Plus also gets a surprising amount of kit, including 20-inch wheels, a top-view camera system, full LED exterior and interior lighting, 12-way heated and cooled power front seats, plush leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, and a Bang & Olufsen 3D audio system with 16 speakers.
Not bad for $74,800 right?
Quattro Electric Drivetrain & Audi Drive Select
The new Audi e-tron also earns the distinction of having the first Quattro all-electric drivetrain. The system will digitally link the front and rear axles. Together with a torque vectoring feature, the drivetrain provides grip on all types of road surfaces.
In the meantime, Audi Drive Select is responsible for motivating the e-tron over rough and muddy roads. The system can raise the suspension to give the vehicle 35 millimeters or 1.4 inches of additional ground clearance in off-road mode. Select “RAISE” mode and the suspension lifts another 15 millimeters or 0.6 inches.

I don’t know many people brave enough to drive the Audi e-tron on a rougher patch of off-road trail, but it’s nice to know it can.
Energy Recuperation
The reason why the new Audi e-tron can achieve phenomenal mileage is the brilliant power recovery system. The 2019 Audi e-tron can recharge the battery pack in a variety of ways. Coasting recuperation will activate each time you lift off the throttle. The system also charges the battery via the brake pedal. The e-tron can choose either the electric motors or the friction brakes to stop the vehicle. If the system chooses the former, the electric motors will basically function as alternators to charge the battery pack.
You can even choose the manual recuperation system using the shift paddles. It all sounds terribly complicated and mind-numbingly high-tech, but isn’t this what Audi is usually about anyway?
Luxurious Appointments
The 2019 Audi e-tron’s interior is typical Audi. The dashboard and door surrounds are flanked with soft-touch and premium materials. The center console is dominated by a large pair of MMI displays similar to the Q8. In the meantime, traditional dials on the instrument console are replaced by the Audi Virtual cockpit with an ultra-high resolution 1920 x 720 display screen.
The interior can accommodate five, benefiting from dual-pane windows, undercarriage sealing, and a plethora of soundproofing materials. The result of all this (combined with the excellent 0.28 Cd of the slippery body) is a hushed ride even at high speeds.
The 2019 Audi e-tron, behind all this technology, is still a family SUV. For example, it offers 28.5 cubic feet of storage in the cargo area. Not enough? Fold the rear seats down to get 57 cubic feet of storage. There is also a storage compartment under the cargo floor to stow away a tool kit and a mobile charging cable. Oh, and the tailgate opens electronically when it senses your foot is under the rear bumper as well.
In Person
If you’re seriously considering the 2019 Audi e-tron, remember it’s best appreciated in the flesh. It will be on display from November 30th until December 9th at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. On November 28th, Audi is releasing a teaser of the e-tron GT concept, an all-electric high-performance sports sedan.

2018/11/25,2020 Camry TRD & Avalon TRD: Toyota’s Idris Elba,"Limited-edition Camry TRD and Avalon TRD are a first for Toyota. 
Both feature a track-tuned chassis, cat-back exhaust, and matte-black 19-inch alloy wheels.
Look, sometimes, all you want is good, dependable, solid transportation. The problem with that though is how good, dependable, and solid can be so boring. Nobody ever said, “Hmm, Idris Elba, or Jim, the balding middle-aged guy from accounting? I’ll go with Jim!”
Which brings us to the automotive equivalent of Jim: Toyota’s Camry and Avalon, and Toyota’s efforts to make them a little more like Idris.
Engine & Exhaust Notes
TRD, that’s Toyota Racing Development, had a go at these blandest of offerings (if you ignore the minivans, and I hope they do, because a TRD minivan might just work). However, if the specs are to be believed, the TRD Camry and Avalon might actually perform better.
Both are powered by Toyota’s 301 horsepower DOHC 3.5-liter V6, mated to an eight-speed automatic with sport mode and paddle shifters. There’s a specially-tuned, cat-back dual exhaust that breathes better and helps with performance. They also say it provides a throatier idle and acceleration sound. Okay.
Testing & Validation
TRD worked the chassis over with thicker underbody braces for increased torsional rigidity. The coil springs are unique to both vehicles and lower the ride height by 0.6 inches. The shock absorbers also get a tune to better manage vertical and roll movements. Specifically, the Camry TRD’s coil springs and front and rear sway bars stiffen things up by 44 percent in the front and 67 percent in the rear, according to Toyota.
For TRD models, the front brakes are larger, with 12.9-inch diameter rotors and dual-piston calipers.
TRD thrashed the things around the Toyota Arizona Proving Ground, TMC Higashi-Fuji Proving Ground, and MotorSport Ranch in Texas to prove the point. As a result, everything adds up to improve control, agility, and steering. From there, Calty did the styling, tweaking the aero elements, like the front splitter, side skirts, trunk lid spoiler, and rear diffuser.
Carmy TRD Treatments
The Camry TRD’s matte-black 19s are a half-inch wider than stock. They also tip the scales at 3.1 lbs. lighter, each, than the outgoing models. Good for unsprung weight, good for handling. The Camry also gets standard Bridgestone Potenza 235/40R19 summer tires, taking away even more of that plain vanilla.
The Camry TRD has a gloss black front grille with a mesh insert and black exterior badging. Available two-tone colors include Supersonic Red, Windchill Pearl, Celestial Silver Metallic, and Midnight Black Metallic. On the inside there’s lots of red. The red-stitched TRD headrests, the leather-wrapped steering wheel, and even the seatbelts are red.

There are unique TRD floor and trunk mats, and the seats come in Black Sport SofTex with fabric inserts. The shift knob even comes with an embossed TRD logo, to further complete the cake decorating aspects of the Camry TRD.
Related: 2018 Toyota Camry XSE is not your average Camry.
Avalon TRD Treatments
The Avalon TRD also gets heated Black Sport SofTex front seats with Ultra-suede inserts and the same red accents, floor and trunk mats, and embossed TRD logo. The wheels on the Avalon are also matte-black 19 x 8.5-inchers that shave an impressive 18 lbs. of unsprung weight. The Avalon TRD will be available in the same colors as the Camry TRD.
Pricing & Availability
No word on pricing just yet, but they will be in dealers by this time next year.

2018/11/25,"2019 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid: Space Age Technology, Logical Fashion","The 2019 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid offers up to 90 MPGe.
Subaru’s new “StarDrive Technology” powers the Crosstrek Hybrid. 
The vehicle makes its official debut at the upcoming Los Angeles Auto Show. 
Here is the 2019 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid, the first-ever Subaru plug-in hybrid vehicle. Wait, can that be right? Subie has never made a plug-in hybrid until now? Yup, that is right. Well it’s about time, for one thing, and they could have put a hybrid drive in a more practical package, for another.
If you were being logical, the Subaru Crosstrek is the only true “SUV” choice. But I get it, fashion statements must be made; the hierarchy at the school drop off zone must be maintained, so that’s why people drive stuff like Range Rovers and BMW X-Types.
If you’re being logical, you need not look any further than the Crosstrek. And now that they’re making a hybrid version, you can ignore the perceived need to buy a Prius.
Space Age Technology
Subaru’s new StarDrive Technology integrates the electric motors, the evergreen 2.0-liter boxer engine (with direct-injection), the Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system, and a Lineartronic Continuously Variable Transmission. StarDrive Technology (totally bitchin’ sci-fi name, isn’t it? “Mr. Spock, prepare to engage the StarDrive!”) uses two electric motors; one works as the engine starter and hybrid battery generator.
The second powers the Crosstrek in hybrid and electric modes, and charges the batteries during regenerative braking. The new, electronically-controlled brake system distributes braking force between the regenerative brakes and the mechanical ones to improve efficiency and extended battery life. Nice!
The instrument panel houses a 4.2-inch color LCD screen for monitoring real-time power output and battery regeneration. The multi-function display, perched above the center stack, incorporates both driving and charging screens.
What’s Good: Solid Range & Towing
And no, this ain’t no Harry Hairshirt, hipper than thou granola-mobile. Subaru dials up the fun (a little). To wit: The Crosstrek Hybrid can reach 65 mph in full electric mode, and it clocks in a full second faster, zero to 60, than the standard Crosstrek. Huzzah! Efficiency suffers? Au contraire, mon frère: Up to 90 MPGe with a total range of 480 miles, and an EV range of 17 miles running on the lithium-ion battery alone.
The Crosstrek Hybrid shares a number of goodies with its “normal” Crosstrek siblings. It has the same Linerartronic CVT with X-MODE and Hill Descent Control for slippery, off-pavement conditions. The Hybrid has 8.7-inches of ground clearance (nice!) and can tow and 1,000 lbs. And the standard, “performance management” SI-DRIVE system adapts the throttle characteristics to your liking between “Intelligent” and “Sport” modes.

Tech & Safety: With That 70s Flair
Naturally, there’s a bunch of tech stuff on-board. Standard features include an eight-inch multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, push-button start, automatic climate control, and two rear USB ports. The standard All-Weather Package comes with heated front seats, windshield wiper de-icer, and heated exterior mirrors. The steering wheel (leather-wrapped, natch) includes audio, Bluetooth, and SI-DRIVE control switches.
The safety gizmos include Steering Responsive Headlights to illuminate curves as you steer (just like Citroens from the 1970s!). Reverse Automatic Braking is there in case you nearly back over something and LED High Beam Assist helps you light up everything without blinding oncoming traffic. The Pedestrian Alert System provides an audible warning to pedestrians when you’re traveling below 20 mph.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid arrives at the end of the year, priced at a rather reasonable $34,995. Destination charges, according to Subaru, may vary depending on where you live. The Crosstrek Hybrid also qualifies for HOV permits states like California and New York.
Given the Crosstrek is Subie’s third-best-selling model in America since its debut six years ago, the Japanese company didn’t want to mess it up.
Hence why this hybrid version is nicely refined and well thought out.

2018/11/23,Lamborghini SC18: Squadra Corse Unveils Their Unicorn,"The Lamborghini SC18 is track-ready but also street legal.  
Customers work with Lamborghini Squadra Corse to design their SC18.
The V12 engine creates nearly 800 horsepower and has a dozen air intakes.
Say ciao! to the SC18, the latest and greatest to roll out of the Lamborghini Squadra Corse shops. Think of it as the road-going version of a dedicated track car, and you’d be half right. Sure, you can drive it on the street, but the SC18 is very, very track-oriented.
A Bone To Pick
Lamborghini Squadra Corse is the Motorsport division of the Sant’ Agata Bolognese firm best known for making cars that go on posters for the bedroom walls of kids (boys, mainly) not old enough to drive.
Yes, Lambo does have the Squadra Corse, but the company doesn’t really race all that much.
This is one of the (major) bones I have to pick with them, but why quibble about that now? Sure, they have a one make series for the well-healed gentlemen racers out there, but that doesn’t really count if that’s the only kind of racing you do.
Testing The Waters
The SC18, designed in-house by Centro Stile Lamborghini, is a one-off road car (the first in the company’s history) that will most likely be a portent of others to come. Yes, it’s “road approved” but Lambo cautions saying it’s “primarily for use on the track.” Which is a polite way of saying it’s harsh, brutish, lacking in comfort and convenience features and, to a chucklehead like me, that makes it even more desirable.
Lambo says the SC18 “paves the way to further personalized development projects for Motorsport customers under the Squadra Corse brand.” So, like I said, this is probably a trial balloon. If people love the Lamborghini SC18, plan on seeing more vehicles in this vein.
Dirty Dozen
The aerodynamics package for the SC18 is described as being “extreme.” By the looks of it, they ain’t lying. The air intakes on the hood come from the Huracán GT3 EVO, for example. The sides and rear include fenders, fins, and air scoops inspired by the Huracán Super Trofeo EVO racer.
Hanging off the back end is the “large” (i.e. monstrously huge) carbon fiber wing. It has three mechanical adjustments, so you can tune it for optimal downforce on any given circuit. Lambo also punched in twelve air intakes on the rear deck lid.
They say it’s a way to “increase heat exchange and improve the cooling of the V12 engine.” Which any eagle-eyed, old rail bird will recognize as louvers from back in the hot rod days.
RELATED
2021 Jaguar F-Type: New In Velocity Blue But Still Red Hot!
The racer look is finished off by the single nut wheels, 20-inch monsters on the front, and larger, 21-inch monsters at the rear. These are wrapped in Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. There’s even a telemetry system to measure all aspects of performance on the track.
Related: The Lamborghini Huracán Performante Spyder is all about open-air emotion.
Snake Pits & Shedding Skin
The SC18 has a top-of-the-line Lamborghini powertrain, bringing the performance of an honest to Ferruccio true racing car to your life. The naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 reels out 770 horsepower and a pavement rippling 531 lb-ft. torque. All that power is handled through an ISR (Independent Shifting Rod) seven-speed gearbox. No, I have no idea what an Independent Shifting Rod trans is, and they don’t give away any details.
It does sound like a snake pit gearbox from a pro-stock drag car, but I seriously doubt it’s one of those.
This drivetrain is wrapped in a body that has gone on a serious weight loss program. The entire body is new, made entirely of carbon fiber, and other ultra light materials. The whole shee-bang even drops to a low-ride-er 109 mm of ground clearance. If that doesn’t explain Lambo’s assertion that “road approved but designed primarily for use on the track,” then I don’t know what will.
[bctt tweet=”This is probably a trial balloon. If people love the Lamborghini SC18, plan on seeing more vehicles in this vein.” username=”Automoblog”]
Color Array
The color is Grigio Daytona with visible “details” and red screen-printing to enhance its sportiness. In layman’s terms, its grey with a trim kit with visible carbon fiber here and there. The interior is all done up in Nero Ade Alcantara with cross-stitching in Rosso Alala. In other words, black suede with red stitching. The seats themselves are carbon fiber bucket units.
Pricing & Availability
Lamborghini doesn’t mention cost, but given what their other factory specials have run, it will probably be comparable to a condo overlooking Central Park (and just as hard to come by).

2018/11/20,Ram 1500 North Edition: Over The River & Through The Woods (Literally),"The 2019 Ram 1500 North Edition takes it to Old Man Winter.
Goodies include a one-inch factory lift and locking differential. 
Ram’s special edition lineup has seen multiple new entries over the last year. 
Pick your poison Mopar fans! The Hydro Blue Sport, Lone Star Edition, Heavy Duty Night Editions; even a Kentucky Derby Edition. More recently, the 1500 Rebel 12 and 2500 Power Wagon Mojave Sand Editions come to mind. Ram is stacking the deck with special edition trucks and they are adding another to the mix.
The 1500 North Edition is arriving just as Old Man Winter sets up shop, but a note of observation first:
Trucks For Every Taste
Ram’s special edition blast (as it were) is not without sound reason or intent. Think of it like this: trucks sell in droves and that trend will continue for the foreseeable future. With so many on the road, driving one with a special edition theme says I’m part of the crowd – but – in my own individual way. Ram has plenty of that in their lineup today. And it’s especially alluring.
Related: Ram tops GM in sales for the time being.
Concerning the 1500 North Edition, it’s more than just looks – although it is that too. Based on the Big Horn, the North’s monochromatic theme includes the body-color bumpers, door handles, mirrors, and grille. But underneath the skin, the bones are solid.
“The 2019 Ram 1500 North is more than a great-looking pickup, it offers cold-weather content for truck owners who require a no-compromise 4×4 as part of their daily regimen,” explained Reid Bigland, Head of Ram Brand. “A factory lift, locking rear axle, and all-weather tires deliver confidence when your path is anything but clear.”
Those Tires Though . . .
The all-weather tries are three-peak mountain snowflake (3PMSF), severe snow service-rated on/off-road Falken LT tires. Say that three times fast! Three is the magic number, however, for the transfer case, which has three different settings: Auto, High, and Low. Ram added an engine block heater too, for those early mornings after the truck sits facing a north wind all night.
Related: Simple but effective: Our full review of the 2019 Ram 1500 Tradesman.
Interior Treatments
Plenty of warmth inside with a heated steering wheel and the heated, 12-way power driver’s seat with four-way power lumbar. SiriusXM Travel Link Weather, heated and folding mirrors, and Mopar all-weather floor mats are included.
Power & Performance
The North’s 3.6-liter Pentastar with eTorque creates 305 horsepower and 269 lb-ft. of torque, and features revised variable valve timing and two-step variable valve lift systems. By comparison, the larger 5.7-liter Hemi creates 395 horsepower and 410 lb-ft. of torque. Both engines have Interactive Deceleration Fuel Shut Off (iDFSO), which pauses fuel flow to the cylinders under deceleration in third gear and higher.

Every 2019 Ram 1500 – including the North Edition – is equipped with a fully-electronic TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic. The transmission features a wide spread of gear ratios to balance power and efficiency.
The engine choice is ultimately up to you.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Ram 1500 North Edition is available now with a starting MSRP of $47,585. The truck comes in Crew Cab 4×4 with either a short or long bed.

2018/11/12,Aston Martin Vantage GT3 To Take On Abu Dhabi,"Aston Martin Racing’s new Vantage GT3 set for the Gulf 12 Hours.
Three works drivers will join the partner teams in the Abu Dhabi event.
Aston Martin will be dragging three of its customer teams halfway around the globe to run the endurance race at the sparkling Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi. This can easily be seen as Aston carrying on the fine tradition of factories supporting gentleman race drivers and semi-independent teams.
They could win, but they will most surely have fun.
Desert Gold Mines
A few years back, Abu Dhabi, as a nation, realized they were sitting on a small ocean of oil, which effectively means they were sitting on a small ocean of money. Thankfully (from a gearhead perspective) they decided to spread some of that cheese all over the desert floor in the form of a not-at-all-bad racing complex. At the time, the rumors were they dumped more than a billion dollars into the project, and boy, it sure looks like it. Yas Marina (the name of the place) looks like a race track from a sci-fi movie set 50 years in the future.
And, from what I gather, it’s a blast to drive.
Hence, F1 runs there, locals run there and, in the case of Aston Martin, we will see three Aston Martin Racing partner teams run the new Aston Martin Vantage GT3 at the Gulf 12 Hours on December 15th.
Related: An in-depth look at the Aston Martin Racing Vantage GTE.
Team Work Makes The Dream Work
The lead teams will be Oman Racing and TF Sport in the PRO class. A good choice since Oman Racing finished on the podium, third overall, at the same event in 2015. They also came in second in the PRO/AM class last year. The graph is running in the right direction. The Oman entry will be piloted by two Brits, the works drivers Darren Turner, a three-time Le Mans class winner and another team regular Jonny Adam. Joining them will be Omani racer Ahmad Al Harthy.
TF Sport, which has been campaigning an Aston Martin V8 Vantage GTE in the FIA World Endurance Championship, also ran a V12 Vantage GT3 in the 2018 Blancpain Endurance Series as well as the British GT Championships. So no wet-behind-the-ears newbies here. TF will be running the new Vantage GT3 in the UK next year, so gaining experience at the Abu Dhabi enduro will be quite valuable.
New Prospects
Also in the PRO class will be up-and-comers R-Motorsport. They’ve already won once in the Blancpain Endurance Series with the V12 Vantage GT3, nabbing three consecutive pole positions in their debut season. R-Motorsport have been loyal and long-time campaigners of Aston Martin racing cars, so the factory gave them full backing for this race.

“We are really excited to run the new Aston Martin Vantage GT3 on its debut outing outside Europe,” explained R-Motorsport Team Principal Florian Kamelger. “The challenging event in Abu Dhabi will give us the best opportunity to test the car in a long-distance race before we run it in 2019.”
R-Motorsport will have their regular drivers, Jake Dennis and Marvin Kirchhöfer, with a third yet to be confirmed. Just to mention: I can be contacted at: One Automoblog Towers, Detroit Michigan. Although I do not come cheap, I am available.
Further Representation
Aston Martin will also be represented in the PRO AM class by Beechdean AMR, running a Vantage GT3. This will be the race debut for Beechdean AMR. Although new, the team will be headed up in the driving department by two-time British GT and European Le Mans Series champion Andrew Howard (another Brit) and Humaid al Masaood from the United Arab Emirates.
The journeyman Chris Dyson from the good ol’ USA and British works driver Ross Gunn complete the lineup.
“Having been the first team to run the outgoing multiple race and championship winning Vantage, it is a real privilege to be part of a lineup with the first AM drivers to race the new Vantage GT3,” said Beechdean AMR Team Owner Andrew Howard. “We have been lucky enough to test the prototype and if that is anything to go by, then it will be as big a leap from the current car as the Vantage was from the glorious DBRS9.”

2018/11/10,2019 Ford GT Carbon Series: Velocity Mutants Welcome,"The Ford GT Carbon Series is the lightest in the blue oval’s GT lineup.
The GT Carbon Series is both track-ready and street-legal.
The window to apply for ownership, however, is slim.  
The latest Ford GT hasn’t even hit the secondary market, and Dearborn is already messing with it, making it lighter, faster, and just plain sharper all the way around. Sure, it’s not perfect (what car is?) but with these updates, Ford edges (no pun intended) their GT a little bit closer to perfection.
Ford makes no bones about this new GT having a split personality. “The GT Carbon Series will be shredding tracks soon as the lightest of the road-going Ford supercars – and unlike its sibling racer, it will want to be driven home after time sheets are collected,” reads a statement from the company.
And how can I, or any other track-rat out there, argue with that? Sure, sure, coming up with a ride that is killer on the track is pretty easy. But driving it home after you’ve raced? That can be another problem all together.
Light = Right
The stuff you do to a car to make it perform better on the track – removing everything you can, tightening up the suspension, taking out the sound-proofing to save weight, ditching the air conditioning, stuff like that – only makes it loud, sweaty, and buck like a lumber cart through traffic.
Ford has done that for you, without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
The Ford GT Carbon Series shelves nearly 40 lbs. thanks to a host of lightweight advances, like carbon fiber wheels, a titanium exhaust and lug nuts, and a polycarbonate rear hatch with better venting for hot air extraction. The carbon fiber wheels are killer, so much so that a number of racing series outright ban them. The titanium exhaust is a nice touch; great material, but expensive to replace. Same goes for the titanium lug nuts, although that’s not very new.
Ferrari has been doing that for 20 years now, cough, cough.
Ditto for the polycarbonate rear hatch. Hey, if it’s good enough for fighter jet canopies, then who am I to argue?

The Cup Holders Have Left The Building
On the flip side, Ford kept just enough conveniences from the “normal” GT (can you use that word with a car like this?) to make it, at the very least livable, if not exactly usable in everyday situations. The air conditioning is still there, because you know it’s going to get hothothot inside. They also kept the SYNC 3 radio.

“While the Ford GT Competition model appeals to hardcore racing enthusiasts, we found more customers asking for more exposed carbon fiber with the air conditioning and radio still intact,” explained Lance Mosley, Marketing Manager, Ford Performance. “So we developed the Carbon Series to satisfy that need, while providing a distinct look.”
Personally, I would have no problem with ditching the radio. In a car like this, I’m getting enough music from that exhaust and those tires screaming for mercy. Ford, much to their credit, drew the line at the cup holders. I do not have a steering wheel on my coffee table, why do I need a cup holder in my track car?
Also sacrificed to the god of lightness: the driver’s side seat storage bin.
More Carbon Fiber Please
To show off just how special this version is, and to remind you over and over again where the “carbon” in GT Carbon Series comes from, there’s more visible carbon fiber than any other Ford GT. There’s optional accent colors so you stand out from the more plebian GTs, and show what a velocity mutant you really are.
There are two exposed carbon fiber stripes and the interior is slathered in the aerospace stuff as well.
If you are one of the lucky purchasers of the 2019 Ford GT Carbon Series, you can choose between four optional accent colors: silver, orange, red, or blue. Those accents will be found on the mirror caps, center stripe, and brake calipers. You also get a unique seat pattern with silver stitching that is repeated on the steering wheel.
The paddle shifters are clear anodized deals and there’s a unique badge for the instrument panel.

Availability
Prospective owners can submit their applications now but time is running out according to Ford. Which is a nicer way to utter: “On your knees before us, supplicant! We are not sure if you are valuable of our bounty!!”
Hey, I’d fill out the forms and wait in line too, if I had the cash. But I don’t. Cause I’m an Automotive Journalist. But a boy can dream, can’t he?

2018/11/09,2020 Kia Forte GT: Little But Also Big,"The 2020 Kia Forte GT takes inspiration from the Stinger. 
Kia says it’s a practical, compact performance sedan.
The Forte overall is one of Kia’s best-selling models.
2020 Kia Forte GT: Alphabet Soup
Kia decided to roll out the Forte GT way early, showing the 2020 Forte GT at this year’s SEMA show in Las Vegas. SEMA is a good venue for this sort of thing, and the GT version is about as hot as a Forte will likely get. Hopefully, it will not get lost in the blizzard of alphabet soup that are the Forte trim levels. That would be the FE, LXS, EX, GT Line, and GT. Confusing, no?
And on top of that, within the “GT trim levels” you can pick from two: The GT1 and GT2 packages.
Luckily, we’ll only be concerning ourselves with the GT stuff.
Gloss Black Trim & Ambient Lights
The “GT Line” is mainly trim bits that make your car look fast, but it skips the stuff that actually makes it fast. I know, why would someone do this in the first place? I wouldn’t, but I guess somebody does. The GT Line offers stuff like a gloss black grille, offset by red accents. The same gloss black treatment is applied to the outside mirrors (heated and with LED turn signals), the side sills, and rear spoiler.
The GT trim does get a beefier, sport-tuned dual exhaust, 18-inch alloy wheels, and LED headlights. Inside, drivers enjoy contrast stitching, LED ambient lighting, and an illuminated GT dash inlay. The Forte GT Line also gets alloy sport pedals, a flat bottom steering wheel with white contrast stitching, and black sport cloth seats with “performance” side bolsters.
Related: An inside look at the Kia Stinger.
Power & Performance
All this “racy” styling is powered by a naturally-aspirated, 2.0-­liter MPI four-cylinder engine with 147 horsepower. However, it’s with the actual GT that things get more interesting in the engine room. The GT features a turbocharged 1.6-­liter DOHC I­4 plant with gasoline direct injection. The engine puts out 201 horsepower and 195 lb-­ft. of torque, sent to the front wheels through a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual clutch automatic.
Safety & Infotainment
A whole bunch of tech, safety, and convenience stuff is found throughout the 2020 Forte GT. Dubbed “Kia Drive Wise,” all the goodies are standard. There’s Forward Collision Warning, Forward Collision ­Avoidance Assist, Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist­-Line, and Driver Attention Warning. Available options include Blind Spot Collision Warning with Lane Change Assist, Rear ­Cross Traffic Collision Warning, and Smart Cruise Control.

Both GT packages come with LED overhead lighting, a sunroof, and a 320-watt Harman Kardon eight-speaker audio system. Wireless charging, a 4.2­-inch LCD screen, and dual-zone automatic air conditioning? Check.
Pricing & Availability
Price? Kia only says it will be announced closer to the Forte’s on-sale date for the 2020 model year. However, you have to figure it won’t break the bank. C’mon, this is a Kia. Exorbitantly priced, they’re not.

2018/11/09,2019 Lexus LX Inspiration: Really Worth 100 Grand?,"The 2019 Lexus LX Inspiration Series will debut at the L.A. Auto Show starting on November 30th. 
Luxury treatments and limited production make it alluring, but is it really worth the high price tag? 
The 2019 Lexus Inspiration Arrives
Lexus wants more money and, knowing the market, they will probably pry a lot of it from our wallets with the LX Inspiration. In general, the 2019 LX Inspiration is loaded down with tech features, comfort, luxury, the whiff of off-road capability and, sadly, what they consider style.
Like all Lexus models, the LX has that horrid grille that is, at best, reminiscent of The Predator’s face. It is, in short, not a good look. However, for reasons completely beyond me, people still go for Lexus; from the entry level sedans and coupes, all the way to these higher echelon models.
There must be something to keep them coming through the door?
What Could It Be?
Lexus says the LX Inspiration is for those who desire a “higher-level driving experience.” Sadly, I think they’re serious. I’d say bring it out to an AutoX course and let’s see how you do, bub, but that would get old before the first pass was over. Anyone seriously looking for a “higher-level driving experience” best look elsewhere.
Back In Black
The LX is already packed with the materials and performance this market segment craves, but Lexus is going farther with the “Inspiration Series.” This LX comes in stealth Black Onyx and rides on 21-inch black alloy wheels. That grille is black too, which might make it less noticeable. Probably not, but a boy can hope.
There’s also black trim for the headlamps, foglights, and the windows along with smoked headlamp lenses. Out back, there are black chrome accents for the taillamps, license plate, and rear door. Black, black, and black. Sensing a theme here?
The headliner is also black, but the interior is an exclusive Moonlight White Semi-Aniline Leather to complement the exterior. Aniline is a chemical compound, not a color, so I’m not sure what they’re going for here. And making it a semi chemical compound doesn’t exactly clear things up. The carpet, cargo mats, and “key gloves” (what?) all get the luxo-treatment too.
Hey, you wanna know what you spent your money on, right?
Piles & Piles of Stuff
More? Of course there’s more. This is an American-market SUV. More is who we are. More is what we do. For example, the rear entertainment system and a 19-speaker, 450-watt Mark Levinson Reference Surround Sound audio system. It has Felix Pappalardi/I’ve gone deaf levels of power!
RELATED
Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA: Beautiful, Bold & Light
There’s a Cool Box (to keep things cool) and a wireless charger to charge stuff. You get the picture.
The “Climate Concierge” automatically monitors the four separate climate zones inside the vehicle. It then adjusts the fans, heated seats, and steering wheel accordingly. So, Climate Concierge is like a thermostat? I guess Climate Concierge was a better name than Therm-O-Dictator or Temp-Wizard? Barely.
Related: Plenty of luxury and space. Our full Lexus GX 460 review.
Off-Road Capabilities
They say it adapts to any terrain and, given the traditional body-on-frame structure, they’re at least heading in the right direction. Of course there’s a magically-controlled multi-terrain system that adapts to five different types of terrain: Rock, Rock and Dirt, Mogul, Loose Rock, and Mud and Sand.
Although, given what the 2019 Lexus LX Inspiration is and who will buy it, they should have added Soft Rock and Michael Bolton modes.
There’s low-range gearing for “slow-speed crawling” and for handling “steep off-road hills and uneven terrain.” Crawl Control, Turn Assist, and Hill-Start Assist Control systems are standard. Show me the picture of you taking this thing on The King of The Hammers, and then we can talk more about slow-speed crawling.
Related: The 2019 Lexus UX is ideal for those long commutes.
Pricing & Availability
This is, however, a limited edition model, with only 500 being made. It’s available now with a starting price of $100,420. ONEHUNDREDTHOU-!!!! Are they nuts? Here’s my advice: Go out and buy a two-year-old luxo-SUV and an older Corvette.
That’s a much better way to drop 100 large.

2018/11/06,Chevy eCOPO Camaro Concept: Drag Racing Goes Electric!,"Chevy partners with Hancock and Lane Racing for the eCOPO Camaro Concept.
The Chevy eCOPO Camaro is entirely electric and runs a quarter-mile in the single digits. 
Testing is still underway although the concept made its debut recently at SEMA in Las Vegas. 
Okay, calm down, calm down. This won’t be easy for some to hear. Chevrolet has just rolled out a COPO Camaro drag car, and it’s an electric vehicle. I know, I know. Given the torque produced by electric motors, this could be one of the coolest moves ever.
Or, it could be a sign of the apocalypse. “And the angel opened the fourth seal, and an electric Camaro came fourth.” I’m pretty sure I read that in the tech sheet about the head bolt torque specs on SBC crate engines. Either way, you know there’s some die-hard Camaro people taking this like a scene from Ghostbusters.
What’s next? Dogs and cats living together?
Torque Baby!
Personally, I have no problem being the heretic this time around and saying the Chevy eCOPO Camaro could be totally cool! Totally cool in two ways: One, racing improves the breed; and better electric race cars will mean better electric cars for us gearheads. And second: Torque Baby, Torque!
As is well known, electric motors put out all their torque from zero RPM on up. Meaning drag racing should be a perfect venue for messing with EVs to make them more fun.
[bctt tweet=”You know there’s some die-hard Camaro people taking this like a scene from Ghostbusters.” username=”Automoblog”]
By The Numbers
Before we get into the nitty-gritty technical stuff here, let’s go over what a COPO is for those not in the know. The COPOs were Chevy’s answer to things like Super Stock Dodges back in the day; factory strippers with all the go fast drag parts thrown in so you could be king of the Saturday night digs. A few years ago, Chevy brought the COPOs back, and a fun time has been had by all as they squared off against Drag Pack Mustangs (thank you, Ford) and whatever beasts Mopar would let escape from the dungeons of Auburn Hills.
Now, this COPO, (or eCOPO) is just like its (literal) fire-breathing, pollution-gushing siblings. It’s not to be taken lightly. Based on the 2019 COPO Camaro, the eCOPO cranks out 700 plus horsepower and 600 lb-ft. of pavement-wrinkling torque. Chevy estimates it can run the quarter-mile in the nine-second range. Nine. Out of the box. That is . . . not bad at all! Nine!

Ford To Add Over-The-Air Updates In 2020: How Will They Work?
I know guys that have worked all summer to hit single digits, let alone get a turn-key solution. Amazing!
Related: How the Camaro ZL1 became GM’s fastest track car.
How The Chevy eCOPO Camaro Works
Well, it starts with an 800-volt battery pack and ends up with your head snapping back like Ali drilled you in the nose. Between the big, whompin’ battery packs and the ground sits a pair of BorgWarner HVH 250-150 motor assemblies, each generating 300 lb-ft. of torque. Things get real goofy at this point, with both electric motors mated to a “conventional racing-prepared Turbo 400 automatic transmission.”
Really? Isn’t that the same slush box Chevy puts in trucks and stuff?
This thing isn’t a rolling advertisement for the future of electric vehicles; it’s a testament to how tough a Turbo 400 automatic is. Sheesh! South of that, all the power gets channeled to the same solid rear axle used in the production COPO Camaro race cars.
Chevy says the 800-volt battery pack allows for more efficient power transfer to the electric motor, and supports faster recharging. This is important, given the limited amount of time between rounds in drag racing. Also – like I need to point this out – when we can figure out how to juice these things up quicker, the more viable they’ll be for day to day use.
[bctt tweet=”This thing isn’t a rolling advertisement for the future of electric vehicles; it’s a testament to how tough a Turbo 400 automatic is.” username=”Automoblog”]
Battery Management System
This monitors all critical voltages and temperatures within the battery pack. It links into an inclusive safety system that constantly gauges all electrical components for proper function and safe operation. Makes total sense, because an electrical system voiding itself of that much power should be running as hot as a blast furnace from green light to checkered flag. The batteries of the eCOPO live in the trunk and are sealed off from the interior.
Also, you crew chiefs will already be thinking about those big, heavy batteries sitting way back. Yes, the eCOPO Camaro holds a 56 percent rear-weight bias, which, yes, helps launch the car like a golf ball off a tee.
And now, the three words that will make your week: Electric. Crate. Motors.
New Generation
The eCOPO Camaro’s electric motor uses the same bell house mounting pattern and crankshaft flange as the popular LS engines (hint) in Chevrolet’s crate engine portfolio (hint hint). That allows you to bolt it up to just about any GM transmission (hint hint hint). Also, the transmission, driveshaft, and other drivetrain components remain in the same locations as a gasoline-powered COPO Camaro. Meaning the electric motor simply bolts into the engine compartment in place of the gas engine in a direct swap.

And, if you can do it in a COPO, then you could do it with anything else you could fit an LS into. Again: You could do it with anything else you could fit an LS into.
“The possibilities are intriguing and suggest a whole new world for racers,” said Russ O’Blenes, Director, Performance Variants, Parts and Motorsports, General Motors. “The eCOPO Concept is all about where we go in the future with electrification in the high performance space.”
To which I say, “Shut up and hand me that wrench, O’Blenes!”

2018/11/03,"Aston Martin DBS 59: Beautiful, Fast & Extremely Rare","The Aston Martin DBS 59 pays homage to the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans.
The DBS 59 is inspired by the DBR1 but based off the current DBS Superleggera. 
In 1959, Aston Martin landed a monumental one-two finish during the 24 Hours of Le Mans with the DBR1. Despite hard competition from Ferrari, Porsche, and a team of Ecurie Ecosse Jaguars, the David Brown Racing Aston Martin DBR1 emerged victorious. Sir Stirling Moss – who helped win the 1959 World Sportscar Championship – called the DBR1 “the most important Aston Martin ever.”
Only five were built between 1956 and 1959. And when the last one went to auction at Monterey in 2017, it set a new record as the most valuable British-made car ever. Sale price? £17.5m or about $22.5 million.
Racing Green Treatments
In honor of the DBR1, Aston Martin Cambridge is producing a collection of 24 special DBS Superleggeras. With “24” representing each hour of the legendary endurance race it conquered in 1959, the DBS 59 is a rare and stunning specimen. Expect a hand-crafted interior and graphic elements similar to the original DBR1.
“When Aston Martin Cambridge expressed a desire to create a limited run of DBS Superleggeras inspired by the DBR1’s famous Le Mans victory we knew it had to be something special,” said Simon Sproule, Aston Martin Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer. “The soft metallic hue of the Aston Martin Racing Green paintwork is classy and timelessly beautiful.”
[bctt tweet=”The Aston Martin DBS 59 is a rare and stunning specimen.” username=”Automoblog”]
Gloss, Carbon Fiber & Bronze
Gloss carbon fiber treatments compliment the Racing Green paint. Obsidian Black and Chestnut Tan leather adorn the interior. The front grille surround, “Superleggera” bonnet script, rear Aston Martin script, and Q Fender Badge are each painted bronze.
“My favorite element on the DBS 59 are the seat backs that feature fabric inspired by the DBR1 seat material, but there are countless touches that will intrigue and delight,” Sproule said. “The level of thought and detailing is exceptional.”

Helmets, Suits & Gloves Included
The Saddle Leather Helmet Pods (rear compartment) are for storing the special crash helmets, race suits, and gloves. The set includes period blue racing overalls, string-backed racing gloves modeled after those worn by 1959 Le Mans-winning driver Caroll Shelby, and a replica 1959 race helmet.
There is even a two-piece luggage set to match the interior trim, plus a Racing Green car cover.

2018/11/02,2019 Cadillac V-Series Pedestal Editions: Limited-Production Luxury Hot Rods,"2019 Pedestal Edition ATS-V Coupe and CTS-V Super Sedan celebrate 15 years of the V-Series. 
Production is limited. Only 300 are for sale in the United States, Canada, and the Middle East.
The 3rd generation V-Series cars arrived in 2015; the Pedestal Editions are the last in that generation. 
My first thought on reading about the Cadillac 2019 V-Series Pedestal Edition was, “Pedestal Edition?” Is that some sort of bathroom sink?” I checked the Lowe’s (and even Sears) catalog, and nope, it’s not.
GM’s right. The 2019 V-Series Pedestal Edition is, indeed, a car.
And not just a car, but a Cadillac.
Race-Inspired
Those that need a quick primer, the Cadillac V-Series is their performance sub-brand. They rolled out the first one in 2004, securing their first victory in the Speed World Challenge sprint racing series at Sebring International Raceway at the same time. Essentially, what we’re talking about here is a Caddy with a Corvette drivetrain. Interested? I know I was.
Caddy’s ain’t normally my thing, but a Cadillac with a Vette underneath? Yes please! Sure, they nipped and tucked here and there, so the V-Series are a little less powerful and a little more softly sprung, but I’m still interested.
So, what’s the big deal with the Cadillac V-Series Pedestal Editions? First off, you get two basic flavors: Coupe and Sedan.
2019 Cadillac CTS-V Pedestal Edition
The sedan version, which Caddy refers to as the CTS-V Pedestal Edition “Super Sedan” (super sedan? oh please.) gets a lot of fun sounding goodies. First, Cadillac V-Series Pedestal Editions come in Bronze Sand Metallic. I’m sure it’s a rather pretty shade, but still, it’s brown. And brown is a terrible car color idea. Never get a brown car. The first car I owned was root beer brown, and it always looked dirty. Even right after I washed it.
But other than that, the Cadillac V-Series Pedestal Editions have a bunch of nice perks.
There’s a full Carbon Fiber Package that includes the front splitter, hood vent, rear spoiler, and rear diffuser. The Luxury Package comes with tri-zone climate control (two for the front, and a single in back), a split-folding rear seat with armrest, heated rear seats, a power rear-window sunshade along with manual rear side-window sunshades. There’s a 110-volt power outlet and a rear Camera Mirror too.
The front chairs are “race-inspired” performance seats from RECARO. I’m sure they skew toward the cushy side, since this is, after all, a Cadillac. The Cadillac V-Series Pedestal Editions also come with a Data and Video Recorder system and red Brembo brake calipers.
How the Cadillac CTS became the basis for GM’s fastest track car.
2019 Cadillac ATS-V Pedestal Edition
Now, the 2019 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe Pedestal Edition. Think of Caddy’s ATS-V as being the gentleman’s Corvette: fast, powerful, still striking, but not as flashy or in your face as a Vette. “I’ve made it. I’m here. I am worth paying attention to, but I’m not going to scream about it, because I’m not 16 any more.”
RELATED
2020 Honda Ridgeline, Fit & HR-V Arrive: Here's An Overview of Each
Like its sedan sibling, the 2019 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe Pedestal Edition comes in Bronze Sand Metallic. Nothing we can do about that. The coupe gets 18-inch V-Series wheels in After Midnight finish versus the 19s found on the sedan. Although like the CTS-V Pedestal Edition, the ATS-V variant gets its own Carbon Fiber Package, Brembo brakes, and RECARO seats.
There’s even a “serialized certificate of authenticity.” Is Cadillac worried about forgeries?
[bctt tweet=”There’s a serialized certificate of authenticity. Is Cadillac worried about forgeries?” username=”Automoblog”]
Power & Performance
The Cadillac ATS-V features an LF4 Twin Turbo V6 with 464 horsepower, 445 lb-ft. of torque, and a top track speed of 189 mph. By comparison, the CTS-V’s supercharged V8 creates 640 horsepower and 630 lb-ft. of torque. The CTS-V tops out at 200 mph and hits 60 in 3.7 seconds.
Pricing & Availability
If either of these sound like the ride for you, Cadillac dealers are accepting orders. The 2019 ATS-V Coupe Pedestal Edition starts at $77,090 (about Vette territory) and the 2019 CTS-V Pedestal Edition sedan will run you $102,590.
Both come with tuition and luxury accommodation for the two-day Cadillac V-Performance Academy at Spring Mountain. Which, I got to say, is nice icing on the cake.

2018/10/30,2019 Hyundai Veloster N: Does It Bite Or Just Bark?,"The 2019 Hyundai Veloster N has a number of suspension enhancements for the track.
A “standard” engine is available, although the larger 2.0-liter turbo will warrant better performance.  
Looks like Hyundai is serious about this whole N business. All the cool kids got their in-house performance shops: Audi has the S and RS models, Merc has AMG, Cadillac has the V Series, and so on. Now Hyundai (of all people) wants a piece of that pie. Ergo, we are now faced with the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N.
The overriding question: does this mean it goes faster, or is it just a bunch of trim?
On The Clock
The Korean car manufacturing giant went so far as to roll out the Veloster N at Thunderhill Raceway. Not a bad little track, to be sure, and it’s also a good way for Hyundai to say,“We’re serious about this performance stuff.” The other side of that coin is how this is a race track buddy. You better be serious, because the stopwatch don’t lie.
Engine & Transmission
Starting with the lump, the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N comes with a larger 2.0-liter turbo with direct-injection versus the “normal” Veloster Turbo. The N branded mill is good enough for 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. o’torque. The inter-cooler is separated from the condenser and radiator for better charge cooling. The induction system has a “two-stage” setup for maximum output at all rpm ranges. Hyundai doesn’t go into detail, but I surmise it some sort of V-Tec/VVTi sort of deal, or perhaps they monkeying with the intake runner length somehow?
There’s also a “standard” Veloster N powertrain putting out 250 ponies and the same torque, but why would you want that? Shoot, why would Hyundai even offer it?
That high-output plant is hooked to a close-ratio, short-throw six-speed manual with downshift rev-matching. The synchro rings are carbon-coated and the gears are reinforced for smoother operation and lower shift force. The N’s clutch has a double-layer facing disc design for increased strength and torque handling.
[bctt tweet=”Now Hyundai (of all people) wants a piece of that pie. Ergo, we are now faced with the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N.” username=”Automoblog”]
Exhaust System
When it comes to getting the bad air out, there’s a multi-mode, high-flow active sport exhaust system with a variable exhaust actuator. If you flip the exhaust into “N mode” you get a nice engine over-run exhaust crackle during up-shifts and rev-matched downshifts. Hyundai does this with an Electronic Sound Generator that “enhances the natural powertrain sound for an even sportier driving resonance between the engine and the driver.”
RELATED

You know what would have worked even better Hyundai? A good, straight exhaust system without all the monkey business. Would’a saved weight too. In case you’re interested, the Veloster N gets 22 city, 28 highway, and 25 combined mpg.
Steering & Suspension
The 2019 Hyundai Veloster N is more than just an engine, thankfully. The Veloster N’s Power Sense Axle geometry has a zero-scrub radius for more precise steering, quicker response, and a direct on-center feel. The power steering system is rack-mounted and secured in three spots for “reduced flex,” especially during high-performance driving.
An available, electronically-controlled torque-vectoring system is there via the N Corner-Carving Limited-Slip Differential (ha!). This enhances launch performance and maximizes cornering speed. However, the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N also serves up a wide range of driver tuning via the “N Grin Control System.” No, seriously: N Grin Control System? Just stop.
Anyhoo, modes include Normal, Sport, N, Eco, and N Custom. Each of these change the throttle response, rev-matching, exhaust note, active differential tuning, suspension damping rates, steering feel, and yaw-control. The N Custom mode lets you tweak stuff to your individual desires.
Braking comes via 13.6-inch rotors in front and 12.4-inchers at the rear.
Styling & Design
In the looks department – because you want everyone to know you’re driving a special Hyundai, don’t you –  the Veloster N has a unique fascia and grille with brake cooling air ducts. LED headlamps and 19-inch star-design wheels, of course. The 235/35R19 Pirelli P-Zero summer tires are an exclusive compound, says Hyundai.
Of course there’s a rear spoiler, integrated diffuser, and LED tail lamps.
Color Palette
The 2019 Hyundai Veloster N comes in four colors: Ultra Black, Chalk White, Racing Red, and Performance Blue. The interior is basically black with unique molding accents to match the exterior color. Special N-treatments include the cloth sport seats (with hefty bolstering), steering wheel, shift knob, door sill plates, and instrument cluster.

All Said & Done . . .
So? Does all this add up to less time per lap? Dunno. Hyundai needs to get us a couple of these so we can run it back-to-back with other factory hotrods of the import-tuner variety. Until then, we will just have to guess at how good or bad the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N will be.
If nothing else, the 2019 Hyundai Veloster N is now part of Forza Motorsports.

2018/10/26,McLaren Speedtail: An Angel In The Outfield,"The McLaren Speedtail was recently revealed to future owners at a private event in London.
The Speedtail is the first of 18 new cars under the company’s Track25 business plan.
It’s the fastest McLaren in history, capable of 250 mph.  
The info on the new McLaren Speedtail hypercar was just released. And if this thing performs anywhere close to what it looks like, it should be angelically fast. Yes, Speedtail is not the most adroit of names, and, yes, it’s hideously priced.
But who cares?!
The McLaren Speedtail is the direct successor to the McLaren P1 and the spiritual successor to the stunning F1.
Chart Topper
Like the F1, the Speedtail seats three people in a triangular arrangement, with the driver up front and in the center. And, like the P1, it’s a hybrid with all of the normal Prius stuff oriented towards speed and performance, rather than environmental smugness. However, unlike the P1, the Speedtail is aesthetically staggering rather than hideous.
The Speedtail lines up against rides like the Porsche 918, the La Ferrari, and, to a lesser extent, boutique cars like Paganis and Koenigseggs. The specs nudge it just to the top of that list, which will hopefully spur Porsche and Ferrari to even further heights when they respond. Before we dive into those specs, let’s get the horrible, bad news out of the way first: You’re too poor and too late.
[bctt tweet=”If this thing performs anywhere close to what it looks like, it should be angelically fast.” username=”Automoblog”]
Rare Beast
The McLaren Speedtail was recently shown to future owners and McLaren customers at a private event in London. You weren’t there? Of course you weren’t. On top of it being secretly shown to the hoi polloi, McLaren will only produce 106 Speedtails, all of which are already reserved. And the final slap in the face: The price starts at £1.75 million plus taxes (or $2,250,000).
So, if you’re that guy from the Carolinas that just won 1.5 billion in the Mega Millions drawing, even you are too late, my good sir.
Now, let’s dust ourselves off, and dig into the techno-buffet that is the McLaren Speedtail. McLaren’s design brief here is that the Speedtail is the first “HyperGT” and the ultimate road car. McLaren says it “harmonizes sleek and seamless beauty with pioneering technologies and extreme performance.”
I know that “in the eye of the beholder” stuff, but, c’mon! Even Stevie Wonder could see how pretty this thing is!

Tricks & Treats
The teardrop shaped cockpit and dramatically elongated, aerodynamically-optimized Speedtail measures in at a tick under 17 feet: 16.9 feet to be exact (or 5,137 mm for you Euros). The body is carbon fiber, of course, and is the key to the Speedtail being the most aero-efficient McLaren road car yet. Even the glass is high-tech, with an advanced electrochromic windshield (windscreen, to you Brits) that darkens up top at the touch of a button.
Trick, slick, and no more sun visors!
The interior design is as sleek and modern as a sci-fi film. Gauges are replaced by three flat panel displays, or a glass cockpit, as we used to say in the aerospace industry. McLaren even put switchgear above and ahead of the driver for that UFO feel. Of course the Speedtail purchaser can trick out the interior, but customization is more than just an interior thing.
The Speedtail introduces a new standard of high-tech, bespoke customization. Among the astonishing options: interwoven carbon titanium deposition materials and digitally-embossed, full-aniline and lightweight leathers.
There was once a McLaren made entirely out of Legos.
Structural & Aerodynamic Art
Naturally, the Speedtail is all cloth and glue, none of this olde tyme metal frame stuff here, oh no. There is a carbon fiber Monocage body structure, unique to the Speedtail, that encloses the McLaren F1-inspired central driving position. The two passenger seats have enough structural rigidity and impact absorption to rival the cockpit of an A-10. Minus the GAU Gatling gun I hope.
The aerodynamics are on par with a Boeing product. This is normal for a car company with a full-scale, rolling-road wind tunnel running 24/7. And McLaren’s computational fluid dynamics lab would make the submariners at Groton green with envy. There are static, carbon fiber front-wheel aero-covers that feed controlled airflow rearward.
Side mirrors? Not on the Speedtail, boy-o! How about retractable, digital rear-view cameras instead? And the piece de resistance: patented active rear “ailerons” contributing to aerodynamic balance, downforce, and cornering.
[bctt tweet=”And the piece de resistance: patented active rear ailerons contributing to aerodynamic balance, downforce, and cornering.” username=”Automoblog”]
Balancing Act
Calling them ailerons is a bit of an aerodynamic misnomer, they’re basically flaps/spoilers. They appear to be differentially articulated, like the movable aero bits found on the Pagani Huayra and the original Porsche 917 Le Mans racer. The trick bit of having two, independently moving aero surfaces rather than just a single big one is that you can differentially apply more downforce on one side of the car and less on the other.
RELATED

Imagine it this way: you’re going through a big, sweeping left hand turn at a pretty high velocity, say around 150 mph or so. If you can put more downforce on the inside rear wheel rather than the outside, the aerodynamics will both stick the car to the tarmac and help it turn-in more. Slick, no?
There’s even a unique “Velocity Mode” that optimizes the powertrain and active aero by lowering the car 1.4 inches.
Even kids can enjoy the thrills of a McLaren.
Faster & Faster
Max speed? Sit down because the Speedtail is the fastest McLaren ever at 250 mph! The petrol-electric hybrid powertrain brings a combined 1,035 bhp to the party, about 37 more than the La Ferrari. Which must bother Maranello something fierce. The Speedtail can go from a dead stop to 186 mph in 12.8 seconds. That would be an impressive quarter mile time, let alone getting up to the triple-klick that quick.
Zero to 60 is who cares! At this point, cars like the Speedtail can hit freeway speed about as quick as Big Daddy Don Gartlits can.
Stunning. Amazing. Exquisite. Quick. I’ll take my in Papaya Orange, mate.

2018/10/20,"2018 Audi R8 Competition Package: Engage Gusto, Destroy Subtlety","Audi says this version is the most performance-oriented R8 yet.
Numerous Audi Sport performance parts come factory-installed.
Don’t expect to see very many of them as production will be slim. 
Audi didn’t make this version of the R8 any prettier, I’m afraid, but they did make it hotter. It’s lighter, more track-focused and, if you are one of those “performance before all other things” kind of gearhead, then the 2018 Audi R8 V10 plus Coupe Competition is the version you want.
Audi’s cars, it’s sad to say, start out as almost beautiful, but, slowly, over the generations, they get uglier and uglier. When the R8 hit, it wasn’t exactly a Ferrari challenger, but it was pretty darn good, and had tons of on-road Presence. It looked the business. It looked different from the other high end sports cars out there. Every angle seemed to add up.
But now . . . sigh . . . we get this. Fussy. Over thought out. Too many rude angles and creases. It’s not bad, it’s not ugly, but the R8 is heading down a design road it shouldn’t.
All that said, this thing can really haul the mail.
Long Words, Low Weight
Officially, it’s called the 2018 Audi R8 V10 plus Coupe Competition package. Yes, that is a mouthful, but Germans have a penchant for long words (Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften, for example) (that means “insurance companies providing legal protection”)(no, really). So let us just refer to this bad boy as the “Competition Package” shall we?
The Competition Package, first, shaves some unneeded pounds here and there.
For example, titanium backing plates for the carbon ceramic brake pads cut 2.2 lbs., which helps unsprung weight. The wheels are similar to the R8 GT4 race car, and even though they’re a whopping 20 inches in diameter, carve off another 26.4 lbs. Tally it up, and the Competition Package shaves around 40 lbs. versus the “normal” R8.
[bctt tweet=”The @Audi R8 Competition Package can really haul the mail.” username=”Automoblog”]
Celebrity Treatment
Audi then had a go at the aero workings for the Competition Package. The latest aero kit (full carbon fiber, of course) not only looks aggressive, but offers noticeable increases in downforce. At around 150 km/h (that’s 93.2 mph for you ‘Muricans out there), the downforce is doubled compared to an R8 V10 plus Coupe (see, long names!). At that speed, you’re garnering to 52 kg (114.6 lbs.) of downforce.
Which is like having Ariana Grande along for the ride, but without the screeching vocals and auto-tuning sins.
RELATED

When the Competition Package hits its vMax – 315 km/h or 196 mph –  the new aero package is producing 100 kg (220.5 lbs.) more downforce than before, for a total of 250 kg (551.2 lbs). Which is like having Shaquille O’Neal and me stuffed into the passenger seat! All this increased downforce and aero tuning, sadly, has the disadvantage of raising drag coefficient from a previous Cd of 0.36, now up to 0.42.
The carbon fiber aero kit includes the fixed rear wing, side sills, front spoiler and front flics, and the rear diffuser.
  [bctt tweet=”It’s like having Ariana Grande along for the ride, but without the screeching vocals and auto-tuning sins.” username=”Automoblog”]
Perfect Ten
Audi will only be making ten versions of the Competition Package, with all 10 units being identical and “pre-configured” with the same features. The exterior is painted Suzuka Gray (sort of an off-white). The chairs are black racing shell seats with red contrast stitching. Leather is everywhere, with a full leather package including the upper and lower dash, doors, and side panels.
Tunes are provided by a Bang & Olufsen sound system with 13 speakers and 550 watts of amplifier power. All ten versions will come with the aformentioned performance brake pads and titanium backing plates.
Pricing & Availability
This R8 Competition Package is scheduled to arrive next month. And it will run you . . . $237,350! Or, you know, what granny and gramps spent on their retirement home in Palm Springs.
Worth it? That’s really up to you, although, despite the look, I do have a fondness for the R8.

2018/10/19,2019 BMW X7: The Beast From The East,"The 2019 BMW X7 is many things. Small is not one of them. 
BMW’s Sports Activity Vehicle offers two engines and an endless list of optional features.
The new X7 will be the fifth model produced at BMW’s Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina. 
“Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! And since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the spear!”
Yeah, I cribbed that one, and yeah, the new 2019 BMW X7 is b-i-g big. Do we really need this Ahab? Our roads will be better because of this? What do you think?
Get the harpoon.
Bigger Is Best
Yup, it’s big. How big? 17 feet long, six and a half feet wide, and standing a tick under six feet tall. Surprisingly, the weight is “only” 5,600 lbs. I say only because I was expecting something that looks like a vanadium steel ingot on wheels to tip the scales in the five-digit range. So yeah, coming in at 2.25 Miatas is a victory.
Do we need this? Of course we do. We are, after all, Americans. We like ’em big and roomy, built like and sized like a Sherman tank with the survivability to match. And boy, does the 2019 BMW X7 deliver on that.
Three rows of seats for the passengers in the back (i.e. The Kids) offer up acres of roominess. Expansive surfaces abound, large trim pieces are everywhere, and other surfaces are framed with electroplated accents, including the instrument panel and center console. You got this much canvas to play with, might as well paint on all of it Jackson.
The center console is where everything lives. Literally everything: iDrive Controller, gear selector, climate settings, Driving Experience Control switches, and the settings for the air suspension and optional off-road modes. There’s enough room in that console alone to nail a golden Guinea with space left over.
Packing Punches
Okay, you ask, so this panzer of a family truck is nice inside, but it’s a BMW, what about power? Becalm yourselves, for the X7 comes with a choice of two engines: A 4.4-liter V8, found in the X7 xDrive50i, and a high-revving 3.0-liter inline six-banger, found in the X7 xDrive40i.
Both gasoline mills feature TwinPower Turbo technology, High Precision Injection, VALVETRONIC fully variable valve timing, and Double-VANOS variable camshaft timing. Each system is exclusive to BMW.
RELATED

The V8 cranks out 479 lb-ft. of torque and 456 horsepower, good enough for a zero to 60 mph time of 5.2 seconds. The sixer has 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft. of torque on tap, adding up to a zero to 60 mph of 5.8 seconds. Yeah, you won’t be out dragging a new Corvette with this guy, but those are pretty good times for something this size.
Both BMW X7 engines come mated to an improved version of the company’s eight-speed Steptronic transmission. The transmission has wider ratios and new electronics to increase overall efficiency.
Want a faster BMW? Here’s what we would pick to leave others in the dust.
Driveline & Suspension Tech
The xDrive all-wheel drive system is rear-biased for those “occasions when the driver adopts a more sporting style of driving,” which is pretty funny to contemplate. There is an optional, electronically-controlled rear M Sport diff if you really want to get “sporty.”
Somehow, and for some reason, BMW has thrown an electric motor into this optional rear differential. It allows as much as 1,106 lb-ft. of drive torque to be redirected from wheels with less grip to the ones with more.
I’m sure it works like the business, but heaven help your bank account if it comes apart.
The 2019 BMW X7 comes standard with Dynamic Damper Control with two-axle air suspension. Other options in the chassis department include the Dynamic Handling Package, Integral Active Steering, and M Sport Brakes.
The available Active Comfort Drive with road preview works with the air suspension and an active roll-stabilization system. Along with camera sensors that preview the road ahead, the system proactively makes suspension adjustments.
Want something smaller? The new X5 is coming and the X4 is already available.
Positive Vibes
Otherwise, the list of optional tech, connectivity, and safety equipment reads like a 550 page treatise on the ins and outs of whale oil production. But, get this: BMW says the Panorama Sky Lounge LED Roof generates a “very special and exclusive aura when darkness falls, with LED light spreading evenly across the glass surfaces to illuminate more than 15,000 graphic patterns and generate a display reminiscent of a starlit sky.”
I bet this will be real popular in Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, and anywhere else where pot is legal. And there’s a Harman Kardon system that would make Owsley Stanley blush.
Worth It?
The megillah that is the 2019 BMW X7 is an air of Teutonic prerogative and condescension. That means they’ll probably sell by the boat-load, even with pricing starting at $74,895 for the X7 xDrive40i. By comparison, the X7 xDrive50i begins at $93,595.

2018/10/19,2019 Toyota 4Runner Nightshade Edition: All About Dat Traction,"The 2019 Toyota 4Runner receives a new Nightshade Special Edition trim. 
Fox Internal Bypass Shocks are available for the 4Runner along with terrain control features. 
Toyota calls the 4Runner a “Sherpa among SUVs.” Sherpa? Really? Sure, why not. You do you Toyota. 
There’s a new Toyota 4Runner out, and I suppose that’s a good thing, but it also makes me ask: Why build new ones, don’t the originals last forever? I live in rural farm country, and the biggest slice of the vehicle ownership pie out here breaks down into two vehicles: full-sized pickups (F-150s, Rams, and such) and Toyota 4Runners.
4Runners are everywhere, and why not? They have room, they have versatility, they can be seriously modified (if you want to get into off-roading) and they last forever, near as I can tell. So what gives? What does the 2019 Toyota 4Runner have to offer us, in the off-road and durability department?
Night Moves
For starters, there’s a new Nightshade Special Edition available, and the cool stuff is actually performance oriented. The TRD Pro package gets you a Fox Suspension (cool!), roof rack, and JBL Premium Audio for that “west coast sound.” TRD Off-Road and Off-Road Premium Grades get you even more capability with a 270 horsepower V6 and a hefty 5,000-lb. towing capacity. That’s more than enough for a trailer and your fave weekend track toy.
The 2019 Toyota 4Runner is still a truck, with a body-on-frame construction. So yeah, it will twist and flex, but in all the right ways for off-roading.
Buyers get their choice of 2WD, part-time 4WD with a two-speed transfer case, or, in the Limited models, a full-time multi-mode 4WD with a two-speed transfer case and a locking center diff. All of the 4×4 models offer 9.6 inches of ground clearance. Sweet!
[bctt tweet=”It will twist and flex, but in all the right ways for off-roading.” username=”Automoblog”]
Badges & Markings
All 4Runners come with projector beam headlights and LED rear combination lamps. SR5 and TRD models have 17-inch alloy wheels in three designs: six-spoke, seven-spoke or matte black. The TRD Off-Road and TRD Off-Road Premium are separated from the pack by color-keyed bumpers and overfenders, hood scoops, and silver-painted front and rear bumper accents. “TRD Off-Road” badges adorn the C-pillars.
The top-kick Limited is the only 4Runner you can get with a chrome-plated grille insert and exterior trim. And, more importantly for some, 20-inch machine-finished wheels and boss P245/60R20 tires.
Back Is The New Black
Now, this whole Nightshade Special Edition deal. Sigh, here we go. “Black is the name of the game for the new Nightshade Special Edition,” says Toyota, taking themselves far too seriously. The Nightshade Special Edition is based on the Limited grade, but offers black accents all throughout the vehicle. The front and rear bumpers, outer mirrors, door handles, window moldings, rockers panels, roof rails – even the exhaust tip.
RELATED
2020 Hyundai Sonata: All The Details (With Some Liquid Chrome)
On the inside, there’s black trim on the steering wheel, center cluster and console panels, shift knob and shifter panel, and inner door grips. However, for some reason, the Nightshade comes in more than black: Magnetic Gray Metallic and Blizzard Pearl, for example. Kinda defeats the whole “black is the name of the game” thing, don’tcha think?
Traction Jackson!
All of the 4WD 4Runners are powered by a 270 horsepower 4.0-liter V6 with 278 lb-ft. of torque. Toyota’s VVT-i variable valve timing deal is on-board too. A five-speed ECT-i automatic transmission with sequential shift mode is there for gear selection. There are a bunch of chassis goodies that actually seem useful too. For example, Hill-Start Assist Control for steep inclines, and Downhill Assist Control for the exact opposite.
TRD Off-Road, Off-Road Premium, and TRD Pro models add an electronic-locking rear differential and Toyota’s Crawl Control. Think of it as a factory rock crawler setting, and you’ll get the point. CRAWL (as Toyota calls it) adjusts engine speed and braking so the 4Runner keeps moving forward or backward in one of five driver-selectable low-speed settings. Trick!
Ultimately, CRAWL allows the driver to focus on steering without having to modulate the throttle or brake pedal. Toyota calls this “The Added Attraction of Added Traction” which I am totally stealing.
[bctt tweet=”Toyota calls this The Added Attraction of Added Traction, which I am totally stealing.” username=”Automoblog”]
Suspension Tech
Suspension-wise the 4Runner TRD Off-Road models have a Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System available for extended wheel travel at slow speeds. The TRD Pro kicks it up a notch, with 2.5-inch Fox Internal Bypass Shocks with precise compression damping in both high-speed and low-speed situations.
The front Foxes are paired with TRD-tuned coil springs and an additional inch of lift; the rear 2.5-inch Fox shocks have remote reservoirs.
Toyota also points to the “Cross Linked Relative Absorber System” or X-REAS suspension. This system automatically adjusts the damping force of the shocks when driving on rough roads or through corners. A center control absorber cross-links the shock absorbers on opposite corners of the vehicle, reducing pitch and yaw by offsetting opposing inputs.
Does it pass muster? Our full review of the 2018 Toyota 4Runner.
Considering a pre-owned model? Our full review of the 2017 4Runner.

According to Kelly Blue Book, the 2019 Toyota 4Runner Limited starts at $43,225 with the Nightshade theme starting at $44,965. Destination charge is $1,045.

2018/10/16,"2019 BMW 3 Series: Luxury Car, Sports Sedan Or Both?","The complete redesign of the 2019 BMW 3 Series looks promising.
New engine technologies and suspension designs increase overall performance. 
The 2019 3 Series faces stiff competition from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, and Genesis. 
The BMW 3 Series began its life in the United States in 1976 as a successor to the 2002.
As with all things in life, change is inevitable. It wasn’t too long ago that a certain Elon Musk had the idea of mass-producing an electric car. It was nothing short of ludicrous, but look how it turned out, for better or worse. The Tesla Model 3 is now the best-selling luxury car in the USA as of August.
The Model 3 also outsold the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class in the entry-level luxury segment.
BMW disputes this . . . in general.
“The BMW 3 Series has ranked as the world’s biggest-selling premium car, led the way for high-performance powertrain and chassis technology and earned a reputation as a pioneer of technological innovations in its segment,” reads a statement from the automaker.
Luxury Car or Sports Sedan?
Thus the reason why I’m shocked at what people think about the 2019 BMW 3 Series. The car made its debut at the 2018 Paris Motor Show. Since then, all we’ve been hearing from critics are expletive adjectives coupled with nuisance rants. I wonder what the fuss is all about.
The 2019 BMW 3 Series is bigger than the outgoing model. It represents the seventh generation of a beloved sports sedan – but that’s what the critics are pointing out. They say the new 3-Series is a proper luxury car now instead of a laser-focused sports sedan.
But is there something wrong with that?
By The Numbers
Sure, the new 3 Series is 0.5-inches taller, 2.9-inches longer, and 0.6-inches wider than the previous model. In fact, the front and rear track are wider by 43 and 21 millimeters respectively. The result is a more aggressive stance.
But despite the added bulk, the new 3 Series is 121 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model, thanks to the extensive use of aluminum in the engine sub-frame, front fenders, and hood. BMW claims overall rigidity is up 25 percent with as much as 50 percent improvements in certain areas of the body. It seems BMW hasn’t forgotten how to make a sharp-handling sedan, right?
BMW is so obsessed with improving the driving dynamics, even the center of gravity is 10 millimeters lower than the old model. In order for the car to slice the wind, BMW designers utilized every trick in the book to reduce the drag coefficient to 0.26 Cd.
RELATED
2021 VW Atlas: Quick But Detailed Overview
So yeah, the 2019 BMW 3 Series is bigger, taller, and wider than the old car. But it also happens to be stiffer, lighter, and more slippery. Nobody complained when Honda and Toyota supersized the Civic and Corolla. Based on the above specs, the new BMW 3 Series is probably the return of the ultimate driving machine.
[bctt tweet=”They say the new 3-Series is now a proper luxury car instead of being a laser-focused sports sedan. But is there something wrong with that?” username=”Automoblog”]
Turbocharged Power
Of course, what ultimate driving machine is complete without a stonking motor? The base 330i is motivated by a new 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four with 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque. This engine, mated to an eight-speed automatic, features a twin-scroll turbocharger, direct injection, and variable camshaft timing.
The 2019 BMW 330i can sprint to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds. The 330i xDrive with all-wheel drive can perform the same feat in 5.3 seconds.
But if the idea of a four-cylinder engine is a tough pill to swallow, then consider the M340i instead. It comes with a turbocharged straight-six motor with 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. The sprint to 60 mph takes just 4.2-seconds, courtesy of the eight-speed auto and standard rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is available; BMW’s M Sport rear differential is standard.
If you were pining for a manual in the 2019 BMW 3 Series, you’re out of luck. Only diesels with rear-wheel drive receive a manual gearbox.
Begging To Be Driven
The 2019 BMW 3 Series is the antithesis of what critics were hoping for. With a classy interior and gorgeous exterior (with available adaptive LED headlights even), the new car has clearly veered more towards the luxury end of the spectrum. But by reducing weight and increasing the stiffness of the chassis, along with new suspension and steering tech, there’s no doubt the 2019 BMW 3 Series is begging to be driven. Hard. Presumably on twisty and/or mountainous roads.
The issue starts with the packaging. Sure, the new 3 Series is longer, taller, and wider, although it’s not as roomy as before. And I can’t wrap my head around it. There is 1.5-inches less headroom in the front while leg and shoulder room is virtually unchanged. However, there is now more cargo room in the new 3 Series, which grew from 13 to 17 cubic-feet.
I can live with that.

But There’s A Problem . . .
Two, in fact: the Genesis G70 and Tesla Model 3. I have no idea how the Genesis G70 feels so adoringly good on the open road despite the sub-$35k base price. I won’t go as far as saying the Genesis G70 is the BMW 3 Series for a new generation, but it does feel like it.
And then the Tesla Model 3. The Model 3 is bigger in all aspects than the sixth-gen 3 Series, which BMW addressed by increasing the dimensions on this new, seventh-gen 3 Series. But the Tesla Model 3 starts at only $35,000 (before tax credits) in standard range trim, while the 2019 BMW 3 Series starts around $41,200.
Also, the Tesla is faster and has a more alluring design in my eyes.
But if BMW is in your blood, then expect the 330i in March. The M340i will follow shortly after, with a starting MSRP of $43,245.

2018/10/13,Chevy’s 2.7L Turbo Silverado: Does It Pass Muster?,"Chevy’s turbo Silverado will hit the market before the end of the year. 
The new 2.7L Turbo, according to Chevy, tops comparable Ram and Ford engines. 
How will the new turbo hold up in a product line long dominated by 5.3 and 6.2 V8 engines? 
While the 6.2 V8 is the biggest and baddest rooster in the Silverado barnyard, Chevy is showcasing a new spring chicken for their 2019 1500 lineup. It’s hard to imagine General Motors – with the mighty 6.2 and evergreen 5.3 – going smaller. And turbo. But alas, as Garfield once observed, the times are always changing.
Meet the new 2.7L Turbo four-cylinder for the 2019 Chevy Silverado.
By The Numbers
When the 2019 Silverado debuted, new engine technologies, advanced manufacturing, and “mixed material strategies” were the core of the discussion. Earlier this year, we received further insight into how the new Silverado came together, after sitting down with Scott Damman, Lead Development Engineer for the 2019 Silverado.
“The engineering team was actually tasked with going and looking at every single part for weight savings,” he explained. “To do that we actually went to our suppliers and our supply base to begin pulling on new technology, which included new processes for building things.”
A 2019 Chevy Silverado with the 2.7L Turbo is 380 lbs. lighter than a current model with the 4.3L V6. As a bonus, the turbo Silverado is still lighter, despite increased interior and cargo space. Standard on LT and RST, the new turbo offers a 14 percent torque increase and a 13 percent bump in city fuel economy versus the 4.3 V6. It’s also a full second quicker when sprinting to 60 mph (6.8 seconds).
EPA fuel economy ratings come in at 20/23 city/highway for rear-wheel drive models. Max towing is 7,200 lbs. with a 2,280 lbs. max payload when properly equipped.
“With up to 23 mpg on the highway, the truck is efficient while still offering plenty of capability to tackle weekend projects and trips to the lake,” said Tim Asoklis, Silverado Chief Engineer.
[bctt tweet=”While the 6.2 V8 is the biggest and baddest rooster in the Silverado barnyard, Chevy is showcasing a new spring chicken for their 2019 1500 lineup.” username=”Automoblog”]
Barnyard Brawl
On the nitty-gritty end, Chevy is swinging heat at their fellow Detroit rivals. The bowtie brand says the turbo Silverado delivers 310 horsepower and 348 lb-ft. of torque, topping Ford’s 3.3L V6 and Ram’s 3.6L V6 mild hybrid by 31 and 29 percent respectively. With the 2.7L Turbo, peak torque runs between 1,500 and 4,000 rpm; the engine reaches said peak quicker than the aforementioned Ram and Ford mills, according to Chevy.

Ford, Wayne State, ACCESS Launch Mobile COVID-19 Testing For Michigan First Responders
Chevy’s 2.7L Turbo should not be confused with Ford’s 2.7L EcoBoost, which is a V6. Same displacement yes, but different class. That engine generates 325 horsepower and 400 lb-ft. of torque by comparison. Ford’s 3.3 V6, which is naturally-aspirated, creates 290 horsepower and 265 lb-ft. of torque.
Still, with Chevy having such an extensive history with the 5.3 and 6.2, how will – or how can – the 2.7L Turbo Silverado find its place? Granted, Ford’s EcoBoost engines are in a different class, but does GM now look like Johnny Come Lately? Is turbocharging half-ton trucks best left to Ford, considering the EcoBoost F-150 launched in 2011?
Hard to say.
Given the extensive number of options and price ranges, it may ultimately boil down to personal preference. One thing for certain though, trucks today are pulling their weight. And not just in payload but in efficiency. As manufacturers stack their truck lines with more advanced powertrains and lighter materials, the long-term benefits are likely more than we realize, according to this recent Detroit Free Press report.
  [bctt tweet=”With Chevy having such an extensive history with the 5.3 and 6.2, how can the 2.7L Turbo Silverado find its place?” username=”Automoblog”]
Physical Chemistry
The 2.7L Turbo’s genetic makeup includes a dual overhead cam valvetrain system. This enables high- and low-lift valve profiles, continuously variable valve timing, and Active Fuel Management – or cylinder deactivation. The combination helps strike an optimum balance between performance and efficiency.
The 2.7L Turbo is also Chevy’s first application of Active Thermal Management, which uses heating and cooling advantageously across the entire powertrain system.
Translation: this helps with fuel economy, recovering otherwise wasted exhaust heat so the engine and transmission warm up quicker. Finally a dual-volute turbocharger housing improves response and cuts lag.
“The new Silverado 2.7L Turbo delivers impressive performance and fuel efficiency,” Asoklis added. “It’s fun to drive every day – quick from the start, and pulling hard under acceleration.”

Availability
The 2019 Chevy Silverado 1500 features eight trims and six engine/transmission combinations including the new turbo. Expect the 2.7L Turbo at dealers before the end of the year.

2018/10/12,Famed Automotive Artist Draws Beautiful Acura NSX Cutaway,"Acura is showcasing a new cutaway sketch of the NSX, hand-drawn by famed automotive illustrator Shin Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa’s cutaways represent, in fine detail, the powertrain, chassis, and mechanical components of a given automobile. This Acura NSX cutaway sketch took months of perpetration and research, but it was drawn mostly from notes and memory.
Which, given the depth of the NSX, is incredible!
Details Are Everything
For reasons like this, Yoshikawa is among the greatest living automotive artists. However, creating this Acura NSX cutaway sketch was hardly a walk in the park.
“The NSX’s innovative power unit was extremely challenging to draw, making the second-generation NSX the most difficult vehicle I have sketched,” Yoshikawa explained.
The 2019 Acura NSX produces a total system output of 500 horsepower and 406 lb-ft. of torque. The 24 valve, twin-turbo V6 features forged steel connecting rods, a dry sump system, and cast aluminum pistons with integrated cooling channels. Acura measures the turbo boost at 15.23 psi. With a compression ratio of 10.0:1, the NSX cranks out more than 140 horsepower per liter of engine displacement.
“Everything comes down to the details,” Yoshikawa continued. “If you don’t understand the technology that goes into building vehicles, you won’t be able to build them, and you certainly can’t draw them.”
New & Improved
The 2019 Acura NSX made its global debut during Monterey Car Week. Updates include a new body-color front grille garnish and high gloss treatment for the front and rear fascia mesh. A Thermal Orange Pearl paint, an Indigo blue leather interior, and two new brake caliper colors complete the styling treatments.
Performance enhancements include stiffer stabilizer bars and new software tuning. Acura says the NSX now has a time nearly two seconds faster around the Suzuka Circuit.
Below is a clip of Yoshikawa on Jay Leno’s Garage, along with a full-scale image of his NSX sketch. Yoshikawa has been an automotive artist for the last 50 years.

2018/10/12,"Polestar Spaces Are NOT Traditional Dealerships, Company Says","Polestar, a new electric performance band from Volvo Car Group, is establishing their retail network.
The company wants a look, feel, and experience different from traditional car dealerships. 
The first “Polestar Space” will open next year in downtown Oslo, Norway on Øvre Slottsgate.
Polestar Spaces
Don’t call them dealerships, don’t even think of them as such. “Polestar Spaces” are anything but traditional dealerships, according to the automaker. The new electric performance brand, fresh off the North American reveal of the Polestar 1, will begin establishing its retail network.
“Polestar will be a fully digital brand, but a Polestar Space is where customers will be able to come into direct contact with us,” explained Thomas Ingenlath, Chief Executive Officer, Polestar. “In a Polestar Space, they’ll meet and interact with a Polestar brand and product expert, see the engineering under the skin as well as be able to take a test drive.”
The first Polestar Space will open in the middle of 2019 in Oslo, Norway, a key market according to the automaker.
“As Norway is one of the world’s most important electric vehicle markets, it is logical to begin the Polestar Space story in Oslo,” Ingenlath said.
Museum Exhibits & Multiple Channels
Polestar wants a minimalist approach, with a showroom space that closely mirrors the design and philosophy behind Polestar cars. The locations will have a museum-like feel. Wheels and carbon-fibre sections will stand like exhibits, complimented by material finishes, paint colors, and leather samples.
“A visit to a Polestar Space will be a very different experience to today’s typical car dealership,” Ingenlath said. “We aim to surprise and delight our customers, removing the hassle that comes with traditional car ownership.”
Representatives and employees will also embody the company’s retail philosophy.
“As the customer will order the car online, they won’t experience hard-sell, commission-based salespeople in a Polestar Space. Our customers will never feel pressure to sign a contract,” Ingenlath continued. “Polestar is a multi-channel brand which is why it must be supported by a unique retail experience.”
Forward Looking
Polestar opens their portfolio with the Polestar 1, a 600 horsepower, low-volume performance hybrid. The aptly named and higher-volume Polestar 2 and 3 will follow as full battery-electric vehicles.
“By the middle of 2020, we aim to have opened up to 60 Spaces around the world to support the key launch markets for the brand,” Ingenlath said. “As we progress, we will open Spaces in more locations to support our retail development, making the brand more accessible with the opening of each new Space.”

2018/10/08,This Fiat 500 Throws It Back To 1957,"The Fiat 500 1957 Edition is back by “popular demand” according to the automaker. 
The small cruiser pays homage to the 1957 Nuova Cinquecento, originally designed by Dante Giacosa.
As if the quirky size and demeanor of the Fiat 500 was not enough, the Italian carmaker is bringing back the 1957 Edition. The design cues pay homage to the original 1957 Fiat Nuova 500.
But unlike the 1957 model (which came with a dinky two-cylinder motor with 13 horsepower), the 2018 Fiat 500 1957 Edition is motivated by a more powerful 1.4-liter turbocharged MultiAir engine. It now cranks out 135 horsepower and 150 lb-ft. of torque.
“Our Italian-designed, fun-to-drive Fiat 500 comes standard with turbocharged power,” said Steve Beahm, Head of Passenger Car Brands for FCA North America. “The 1957 Edition offers a fun, custom appearance for the iconic Fiat 500.”
Authentic Italian Design
It is easy to distinguish the 1957 Edition of the Fiat 500. The 16-inch retro wheels come in three colors: white, green, or blue. This special edition Fiat 500 also comes with a choice of three paint colors: white (Bianco Ice), retro light blue (celeste blue), and light green (Chiaro) to match the wheel color.
The car receives a plethora of vintage-inspired elements like retro badging, a revised fascia with chrome inserts, two-tone paint (white roof on the hatchback and black soft top on cabriolet models). There are white exterior mirrors and ivory-colored door trim panels. It also receives a delicious Avorio/Marrone leather-wrapped steering wheel (which is Italian speak for white and brown) to match the premium, hand-stitched brown leather upholstery.
Oh, and you also get a unique 1957 Edition key fob. Nice.
Macchina Veloce!
Make no mistake about it, the Fiat 500 is still a decently fast car. The 1.4-liter turbocharged motor comes standard with a five-speed manual, although a six-speed auto is optional. The engine comes with twin intercoolers and a sport-tuned exhaust. This motor is now standard across the range.
But the Fiat 500 1957 Edition goes further still. It comes with a driver-selectable Sport button, which revises the throttle mapping to improve engine response. Models with the optional six-speed auto will experience stronger shift points to deliver a more thrilling driving experience.

Turbo Power For Everyone
For those just learning the ins and outs about Fiat cars, it happens to be the only brand in North America to offer turbo engines as standard on every model. The base Pop trim starts at $16,245, making it the least expensive turbocharged car you can buy today.

The Lounge starts at $19,745 and is the basis for the 1957 Edition. Add $995.00 and you get the special-colored wheels, the Sport mode, leather trimmings, and retro badges.
And if the base motor is not enough, then you’ll need the Fiat 500 Abarth. It comes with an upgraded 160 horsepower 1.4-liter turbo mill that churns out 183 lb-ft. of torque. The Abarth starts at $20,495, which includes red bucket seats, a red engine cover, red brake calipers, and body stripes (yes, in red, too).
The Fiat 500 1957 Edition will arrive later this fall.

2018/10/06,VW & Microsoft Partnership Focuses On Connected Vehicle Services,"Partnership will pursue a “fully connected” vehicle fleet for future Volkswagen models.
Microsoft’s Azure platform will serve as the foundation VW’s connected car services.
VW says they want to become a full-service “mobility provider.”
The hook-ups between automotive and tech companies continues apace, with Volkswagen and Microsoft announcing a new strategic partnership recently. But this seems more than just “such and such connectivity feature is now available in our latest models.” VW and Microsoft have something much bigger in mind.
I know, given VW’s trials and tribulations with all that diesel-gate stuff, and given the fact Microsoft is responsible for the phrase “blue screen of death” becoming part of our modern lexicon, this might not bode all that well, but hey, let’s give ’em a break, okay?
Digital Transformations
Volkswagen and Microsoft are collaborating to fast-track VW’s “digital transformation,” meaning expect more computer-like stuff crammed into more and more VWs as time moves on. Volkswagen is going with the Microsoft Azure digital platform for Automotive Cloud, hoping this will be a decisive step forward in turning the automotive giant into a “mobility provider” with a fully connected fleet.
Mobility provider? Is that what the kids are calling car companies these days?
VW will build what it terms “in-car services” for all vehicles in their brand, known as One Digital Platform, or ODP. And, no surprise, it runs on Microsoft technology. VW says that when finished, One Digital Platform will be the largest digital ecosystem in the automotive industry.
Think of it like Amazon’s in-house servers, only for just VW. Unfortunately, this fully connected vehicle fleet and digital ecosystem will be called “Volkswagen We.” I guess nobody in VW’s marketing department has read Yevgeny Zamyatin?
Foundation & Infrastructure
Along with building stuff we won’t see, VW is establishing a new automotive cloud development office in North America. These digital headquarters will be near Microsoft’s headquarters. So everybody looking to buy a place in Redmond better hurry up. Housing prices are going to get even more ridiculous in the greater Seattle area.
By having a physical presence so close, Microsoft can provide hands-on support to VW as it dives heavily into automotive cloud development. Microsoft is helping in the hiring process too, with the workforce expected to grow to about 300 engineers shortly. Sure, there’s a technological rationale in this partnership, but Microsoft also provides cloud expertise across their entire organization. Thus, VW’s developers and engineers benefit from Microsoft’s culture of collaboration and agile management systems.
All of this will eventually add up to making Volkswagen’s Automotive Cloud a reality.

Internet of Things Will Become Key
Aiming for all this digital vapor to be a reality by 2020, VW wants more than 5 million of its new vehicles per year to be fully connected. Said vehicles will be part of the Internet of Things (IoT) with most of the digital data living in the cloud. Yes, the dreaded Internet of Things. You know, that’s the latest tech panacea meant to make your entire world work like George Jetson’s house. Yet, it only seems to add another layer of frustration.
But I’m just being negative here. Maybe VW and Microsoft will get it to work, cause, honestly, a Jetson’s apartment does sound kind of cool.
[bctt tweet=”This is just an announcement for now. It’s too early to tell if this will work, sorta work, be terrible, or somewhere in between.” username=”Automoblog”]
Future Considerations
Over the long run, what develops here will percolate to other Volkswagen Group brands (think Porsche, Audi, Skoda etc.) in all regions of the world. VW says this will build the foundation for customer-centric services across all its brands, including the upcoming Volkswagen ID. family of electric vehicles.
This is just an announcement for now. It’s too early to tell if this will work, sorta work, be terrible, or somewhere in between. It might make for a cool automotive future. But remember, if your 2021 VW suddenly shuts down, just roll up all the windows, then roll them down again, and then turn the key.

2018/10/05,Honda Debuts Tech That Can See Around Buildings. Here Is How It Works.,"Honda rolls out new vehicle communication tech in Ohio to reduce intersection collisions. 
Research shows intersection collisions are increasingly common and dangerous.
Smart Intersection technology and subsequent systems play a role in the success of autonomous cars. 
Honda is taking their next steps towards a driverless portfolio with the introduction of Smart Intersection technology. Honda says it enhances vehicle-to-everything (or V2X) communication, and can reduce deadly intersection collisions. According to the United States Department of Transportation, 51 percent of all injury crashes and 28 percent of all fatal crashes occur at either an intersection or T-junction.
Recent data from the National Safety Council suggests roadway deaths this year may climb as high as 40,000.
Essential Communication
V2X communication, like Honda’s Smart Intersection technology, uses proprietary object recognition software via intersection-mounted cameras and other communication devices. This allows cars to “see” around and through buildings, walls, traffic, and even bad weather. Drivers then receive an alert to notify them of otherwise hidden hazards.
“Honda believes that V2X technology is an essential component of a smarter and safer transportation ecosystem and can play a role in our dream for a zero-collision society,” explained Ted Klaus, Vice President of Strategic Research, Honda R&D Americas, Inc.
[bctt tweet=”Smart Intersection technology represents a joint venture between Honda and the City of Marysville, Ohio as part of the 33 Smart Mobility Corridor project.” username=”Automoblog”]
Pilot Program Debuts “Where The Grass Is Greener”
Smart Intersection technology is a joint venture between Honda and Marysville, Ohio as part of the 33 Smart Mobility Corridor project. The pilot program will address the limitations of current on-board vehicle sensors with regard to preventing intersection collisions.
“Research underway in Marysville and along the U.S. 33 Smart Mobility Corridor holds great promise in advancing world-changing transportation technologies, and is the 21st century version of Huffman Prairie where the Wright Brothers made their early aviation discoveries,” said Ohio Governor John R. Kasich. “With the help of strong public- and private-sector partners, and our unmatched Transportation Research Center, Ohio is aggressively working to maintain its leadership role for developing vehicles and smart technologies of the future.”
“The City of Marysville is appreciative of our rich history with Honda of America and we are committed to our partnership with them to support their development and testing of autonomous and connected vehicles,” added Marysville Mayor J.R. Rausch.  “We are proud they chose Marysville to deploy Smart Intersection technology here.”
How Smart Intersection Technology Works
Four cameras above the traffic lights at each corner of a given intersection provide a bird’s-eye view of the surrounding area. Honda says the cameras have a range of 300 feet to detect vehicles and pedestrians from farther away. The image processing software creates a 360-degree image of the intersection that classifies vehicles and other moving objects. That information is then broadcast to surrounding vehicles via a dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) signal.

Each connected vehicle’s on-board computer decodes the information and, when necessary, provides visible and audible alerts to the driver. With this information, the driver has the ability to take corrective action to avoid or mitigate a collision. Thus far, Honda has committed 200 vehicles for Smart Intersection testing.
“We believe this research will give us a better understanding of how V2X technologies can be further advanced and most effectively deployed for the benefit of all road users,” Klaus said.
[bctt tweet=”Until cars chauffeur us entirely, law enforcement officials recommend all motorists practice defensive driving. ” username=”Automoblog”]
Auto Industry Pushing Towards V2X
V2X is a viable solution when it comes to safety and autonomous cars, something consumers are wrestling with. Honda is showcasing Smart Intersection technology not a moment too soon; Hyundai and Autotalks announced a V2X-centered partnership in July, while back in June, Cadillac said their Super Cruise system would serve as a springboard for future V2X features. Consumers could see such features as early as 2023.
Continental, a Tier 1 Supplier, unveiled a similar technology last year.
While promising, nothing is here just yet. And until cars chauffeur us entirely, law enforcement officials recommend all motorists practice defensive driving.
“It only takes being distracted for a brief moment and a tragedy can occur,” said Special First Lieutenant and Traffic Safety Specialist Jim Flegel of the Michigan State Police. “As drivers, we still have to maintain control of our vehicle at all times.”

2018/10/05,These Chevy Silverado Concepts Are Headed To SEMA,"The SEMA Chevy Silverado Concepts will showcase the various customization options available.
Equipment upgrades include soft tonneau covers, lift kits, cold air intakes, and Brembo braking systems.
After getting a delicious taste of the new Chevy Colorado ZR2 Bison, it seems they are not done yet. Not by a long shot. Chevrolet will introduce four new concepts of the 2019 Silverado 1500 at the upcoming SEMA Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chevy says these trucks will show off the brand’s full line of truck accessories and performance parts.
Here are the four new Chevy Silverado concepts debuting at the SEMA Show.
Silverado High Country Concept
The 2019 Chevy Silverado High Country is not a concept per se; more like the ultimate Silverado. It combines outdoorsy looks with the space and refinement of a luxury sedan. And the High Country looks pretty darn good whether towing a horse carriage or cruising on the freeway.
You won’t mistake the High Country for a lesser-endowed Silverado because it has jeweled headlights and a specific grille. The grille has chrome and amber accents complete with a High Country logo on the upper left side. It also has a painted front bumper with chrome recovery hooks, chrome accents, and a set of beautiful, low-profile LED fog lights.
The High Country is motivated by a burly 6.2-liter V8 motor, churning out 420 horsepower. With this engine, the High Country is the most powerful Chevy half-ton truck to ever roll out of the factory. Couple this with a two-inch suspension lift, 22-inch wheels, a cold air intake, and a genuine cat-back dual exhaust system (yes, dual freaking exhaust!) and what you have is a pretty badass truck.
Oh, and the High Country also comes with Brembo six-piston front brakes with color matching rear calipers.
Our favorite features include the automatic retractable side steps that sway towards the rear for easier access to the bed. And the push-button powered tailgate.
Silverado RST Off-Road
The 2019 version of the Chevy Silverado RST Off-Road shares the design DNA of the Colorado ZR2 Bison. However, the RST is bigger, taller, and meaner. It has the same Baja-inspired vibe of the Ford F-150 Raptor albeit a bit more civilized. Think Doc Martens instead of a Carolina Domestic Work Boot or Wolverine Tacoma Durashocks and you won’t be far off.
“We know every truck customer is unique, which is why the Silverado offers eight trims, each with a different combination of technology, performance, and design,” explained Hugh Milne, Silverado Marketing Manager.

The Silverado RST Off-Road comes with 18-inch wheels, chunky off-road tires, and a two-inch suspension lift. The Off Road Appearance Package includes assist steps, a soft roll-up tonneau cover, and a sport bar. It is powered by GM’s evergreen 5.3-liter V8 with 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft. of torque.
Silverado LTZ Concept
The Silverado LTZ Concept is the workhorse of the four. It starts with the aforementioned 5.3-liter V8 engine to provide the necessary pulling power. The plethora of dealer-available accessories and performance parts will make your eyes water:
Cold air intake.
Trailering camera system.
Retractable tonneau cover.
Cat-back single exhaust upgrade.
22-inch aluminum multi-spoke chrome wheels.
Brembo front brakes with six-pistons and color-matched calipers.
“With a full catalog of accessories and performance parts, we offer exponentially more ways for customers to build their ideal truck,” Milne said. “And, unlike certain aftermarket components, these are designed, engineered and validated to the same engineering standards as the Silverado itself, and backed by Chevrolet.”
[bctt tweet=”The plethora of dealer-available accessories and performance parts will make your eyes water.” username=”Automoblog”]
Silverado RST Street
Boost your street cred with this one! The RST Street comes with a lower suspension, body side graphics, faux carbon-fiber exterior accessories, and 22-inch gloss black wheels. Accessories and performance parts include the aforementioned Brembo brakes, a cold air intake, Borla cat-back exhaust with two-piece carbon-fiber exhaust tips, and a Kicker sound system with a 200-watt subwoofer.
The 5.3 is also available.

In Person
If you want to see these Chevy Silverado concepts in person, clear your schedule from October 30th to November 2nd, and book a trip to Viva Las Vegas! The SEMA Show will be in full swing then. Also, if you are happening by the State Fair of Texas (now through October 22nd) there are more Silverados on display at Chevy’s exhibit.

2018/10/04,2019 BMW Z4 Roadster: Stand On It Stroker Ace!,"Well, the first thing I can say about the 2019 BMW Z4 Roadster is that it is much better looking than the one it replaces. Seriously, I don’t know what on Earth BMW has to do to get their design mojo back, but, A) they need to, and, B) they haven’t yet. At least not fully.
The next thing I thought was, “Boy, it looks a lot like the current Fiat 124 Spider that’s based on the Miata.” Better not say that in front of any BMW employees. Probably lead to my Arsch getreten werden.
Supra Skin
Which it shouldn’t, since both the Miata and the 124 are fantastic little sports cars. And I’m sure the latest Z4 will be fantastic as well. I mean, come on, this is a German car company we’re talking about here. The other contributing factor to the 2019 BMW Z4 Roadster’s potential greatness is that, under the skin, it’s a – gasp! – Toyota Supra.
The latest Z4 was developed in cooperation with the Japanese auto giant, the fruits of that leading to both the Z4 and the recently-released Supra. Ergo, we’ll have some commonality of parts, and the two minds are better than one philosophy leading to the summation of two very fun vehicles.

The engine has a new High Precision Injection system, 255 horsepower, and nearly 300 lb-ft. of torque. 60 mph comes up in 5.2 seconds. Nett! Life gets even better with the Z4 M40i Roadster, thanks to a 3.0-liter in-line six-banger offering a 47 horsepower escalation over its predecessor. By comparison, the sDrive M40i makes a whomping 382 horsepower with its turbocharged in-line six engine.
Since this is a roadster, both variants are rear-wheel drive naturally.
BMW added a water-cooled exhaust manifold that’s integrated into the cylinder head, along with a quicker-spooling turbocharger and direct injection. Yeah, I know, water cooling the manifold sounds like an expensive stress point, but we’ll let the second and third owners worry about that. And, with 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque living under the hood, you’ll hit 60 in 3.9 seconds. Super nett!
Transmission & Chassis Tech
Both receive an eight-speed Steptronic Sport box with Launch Control and shift paddles on the steering wheel. There’s a wider ratio spread with shorter ratios in the lower gears for stronger acceleration.
The chassis has a perfect 50:50 weight distribution, with a double-joint spring strut suspension up front and a new five-link suspension out back. The front suspension’s sub frame and control arm mounting points are extremely rigid for more precise cornering, according to BMW. Aluminum control arms and swivel bearings further reduce weight. The rear suspension also uses a lightweight aluminum and steel design.

Pricing & Availability
And sure, both of the upcoming Z4s have lots of navigation and infotainment features, and all that high-tech glop. But if you really care about stuff like that, this (probably) won’t be the car for you. Screw stuff like that! Drop the top, pull down your hat, and stand on it Stroker Ace! This is a sports car. Go out and be a sport.
How much? Well, the 2019 BMW Z4 Roadster starts at $49,700 for the sDrive30i, and $63,700 for the sDrive M40i.
Weit draußen, Mann!

2018/10/02,Porsche 911 Speedster Concept: Should We Hold Our Breath?,"The Porsche 911 Speedster Concept shows a “new equipment range” from Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur.
Porsche says the concept’s engine revs to 9,000 rpm. 
Will it come to market? We will find out soon enough. 
Ah, the Porsche Speedster. It’s a name that means so much, but, by their own hand, has been sort of maligned by Porsche themselves. This latest version, which Porsche says is only a “concept” for now, looks to be the business.
But whether it is or not – or whether Porsche will even build the thing – is pretty much up in the air. To begin, there are two things at play here: a car and a wristwatch.
Designer Dog Dishes
Leave it to Porsche to make a fairly simple thing (“Hey! We’ve got this concept car you should check out!“) into something needlessly complicated (“Hey! We’ve got this concept car you should check out! Oh, and this wristwatch, which is kinda the same thing! Oh, and here’s the needless backstory!“).
For those that may not know, there’s a thing called Porsche Design. Porsche Design does all sorts of stuff. Sunglasses and watches and stereo gear and pen sets and other hideously, overpriced knick-knacks. They are a separate entity, but they occasionally collaborate. Such is the case here, but we’ll only go into the friggin’ watch portion of this stuff if space (and my patience) permits.
The car portion of this stuff, the actual Speedster itself, is well worth your time. The concept Speedster had its North American premiere at the recent Rennsport Reunion VI at Laguna Seca. And, so they say, the crowds were very impressed. Then again, Rennsport Reunions are a Porsche-only affair, and Rennsport crowds would be impressed by a Porsche dog dish.
So take all of that with a grain of salt.
Heritage Design Packages
This Porsche concept is based on the current 991 generation of the evergreen 911. Porsche says it’s a preview of a “potential new equipment range from the Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur.” Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur is their in-house “we can make it that way just for you (for a hefty price)” shop. Sort of the latest version of the old Porsche Sonderwunsch Programm. The Speedster also is being used as a canvas to show off the company’s Heritage Design packages. If customers go for this idea, then Porsche will consider providing a modern interpretation of their distinctive themes as far back as the 1950s.
Personally, I like this whole idea of painting new cars like they were old racers. I hope this catches on.

Flying Colors
The Porsche 911 Speedster Concept is a two-tone GT Silver Metallic and White. The white note flashes are reminiscent of the red and white schemes found on the first Porsche 917 to win at Le Mans. The whole car was a collaboration between Porsche Motorsport, Style Porsche, and Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur.
It’s hard not to like the overall look, with the laid-down windshield, twin headrest fairings, retro paint job, and those gorgeous, Talbot-esque rearview mirrors (chrome, natch).
[bctt tweet=”It’s hard not to like the overall look, with the laid-down windshield, twin headrest fairings, retro paint job, and those gorgeous, Talbot-esque rearview mirrors.” username=”Automoblog”]
Proof In The Pudding
The Porsche 911 Speedster Concept is powered by a naturally aspirated flat-six engine (duh!) putting out “over” 500 horsepower. This plant, which Porsche seems to have the infinite capability to develop and get more and more out of, can rev to 9,000 rpm. Which is way up there. Really way up there. Like, that would be a lot of fun to hear on a regular basis. All those Pferde get to the rear wheels and only the rears via a six-speed manual transmission.
The development focus was on creating a pure and exhilarating driving experience says ze Deutschers, but at this stage there’s no real way of knowing. If you want us to be sure, oh great engineers of Zuffenhausen, then drop one by One Automoblog Towers, Detroit, Michigan, and we’ll let you know what we think. Ask for Carl.
Limber Lumber Wagons
Yes, the Porsche 911 Speedster Concept is just that: a concept. So talking about its performance potential is kind of beside the point. But it does give us the opportunity to say that if Porsche really wants to create a pure and exhilarating driving experience, they have to go against their recent trend. Porsches back in the day were essentially hot-rodded VW Beetles with swoopier bodies. They were light, tight, and handled . . . well, not right, but in a fun enough way. Until you spun it into a ditch because of the weight distribution and tractor-derived suspension.
But lately, for the past couple of decades, Porsche has gone light, tight, and handles not all that bad. Now they’ve gone bloated, feature-laden, and computer-controlled, but the handling is better (thanks to all those binary nannies).
If Porsche wants to make a new Speedster for the 2020s and beyond, it should weigh close to a Miata but still keep that “over” 500 horsepower. But no. Our customers want features. Our customers expect luxury items. We have to add 158 airbags. Yadda, yadda, yadda.

2018/10/02,Infiniti Project Black S: Godzilla Slayer?,"The Infiniti Project Black S Prototype debuts at the Paris Motor Show, starting on October 4th.
Infiniti worked the Renault Sport Formula One Team for the Project Black S Prototype. 
The car serves as a “springboard” for high-performance engineering, according to the two companies.  
Will Infiniti actually produce it? That’s not entirely clear . . . 
For all intents and purposes, the Infiniti Project Black S Prototype reminds me of the Hyundai Genesis Coupe and its sleek profile. And similar to the Genesis, the Project Black S Prototype is a proper rear-wheel drive sports car. It also shares the same aura as Godzilla, the Nissan GT-R.
But that’s where the similarities will abruptly end.
The Infiniti Project Black S is more than just a conventional sports car. Utilizing the go-fast gimmickry of the Renault Sport Formula One Team, the Project Black S is the first of its kind to come with a dual-hybrid powertrain system.
Infiniti claims its the first time such a hi-tech system is available for a road car. But here’s the clincher: they must give the go-signal for production before making any claims.
F1-Derived Powertrain
Based on the menu, it all sounds and looks delicious. The Infiniti Project Black S is based on the Q60, specifically the Q60 Red Sport 400. But if the Red Sport is a luxury coupe masquerading as a sporty car, the Project Black S Prototype is engineered to go fast, luxury be damned.
That vast rear wing was designed by the blokes from the Renault F1 team. It is the biggest indicator that the Project Black S is a serious performance machine. The wing even shares the same profile as the team’s Monza wing for their F1 cars, so there’s genuine trickery behind the shape and intent in the carbon fiber rear spoiler.
But the main course is the engine. The Infiniti Project Black S is equipped with the VR30 3.0-liter V6 motor with twin electric turbochargers. Yes, you heard me right. This thing comes with electric turbochargers, spooling up delicious servings of power and torque. The hi-tech motor is connected to a seven-speed automatic.
The cream of the crop is the dual-hybrid technology. There are three motor generator units or MGUs in the Project Black S Prototype. There is a single MGU that harvests kinetic energy from braking (MGU-K) and a pair of MGUs to harvest heat from the twin electric turbochargers (MGU-H). Thus, the dual-hybrid system generates electrical power whether you’re accelerating or braking.

PowerOn Demand
The figures are impressive: 563 horsepower, 350 lb-ft. of torque, and zero to 60 in less than four seconds. The motor-generators spool the turbochargers with a prod of the right foot, delivering power directly to the rear wheels. This means instantaneous response and torque with virtually no turbo lag. If this doesn’t sound like a recipe for a good time, then I don’t know what does.
“The Infiniti Project Black S utilizes high power and smart energy management from advanced powertrains, a thrilling dynamic capability on road and track, and a performance-oriented aesthetic,” explained Roland Krueger, Infiniti Chairman and Global President.
Optimized Aerodynamics
No F1-inspired car is complete without the ability to effortlessly slice the wind. The Renault F1 team utilized all the tricks in the book to give the Infiniti Project Black S Prototype greater aero efficiency with higher levels of downforce. Most of this stems from the unique rear wing. Designed using digital modeling technology, the wing helps stabilize the car during high-speed driving and cornering.
As expected from a track-based road car, the Infiniti Project Black S has large and aggressive cooling ducts. The roof panels, fenders, and hood are carbon fiber to reduce weight. Infiniti claims a curb weight of 3,915 lbs, saying the power-to-weight ratio is 39 percent better than the Q60 Red Sport 400.
[bctt tweet=”This means instantaneous response and torque with virtually no turbo lag. If this doesn’t sound like a recipe for a good time, then I don’t know what does.” username=”Automoblog”]
But Will Infiniti Make This Car?
We hope so. The Infiniti Project Black S is the basis for all future electrified vehicles from the brand.
“The Project Black S represents the very top end of electrification in the Alliance portfolio, and is another example of Infiniti’s entrepreneurial spirit on its journey to electrification from 2021 onward,” Krueger said. “A collaborative venture between Infiniti and the Renault Sport Formula One Team, the Project Black S prototype is a testbed for new ideas and technologies, demonstrating how our Alliance partnerships could make our ambitious visions a reality.”
And besides, the Nissan GT-R is no spring chicken, if you catch my drift. I can think of no other car in the alliance that can go as wildly as the Project Black S.

2018/10/01,2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE: Innovative To The Core,"Last time I checked, Mercedes-Benz had seven SUVs in their American lineup. Need a small luxury SUV? The GLA-Class is not bad for the sub-$34,000 base price. Want an alternative to the BMW X6? The Mercedes GLE Coupe will fulfill your fantasies. But if you want a Mercedes that can shame the BMW X5, both on and off-road, the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is your top choice.
“The GLE exhibits iconic Mercedes-Benz design while remaining true to its character as an off-roader,” said Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer at Daimler AG. “With its design idiom it perfectly embodies our design philosophy of sensual purity, thus representing modern luxury.”
EQ Boost Technology
We got our first taste of Mercedes-Benz’s EQ Boost mild-hybrid system in the 2019 Mercedes-AMG E53 Sedan. In that car, the 48-volt ISG or Integrated-Starter Generator provides short blips of power as the turbochargers spool up.
It’s not much different in the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE. The electric generator works with the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six motor to deliver more torque. The engine is good for 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. If you really need to know, the 2019 BMW X5 xDrive40i can only muster 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft. of torque from a similar inline-six turbo motor with the same displacement.
The generator also feeds power to the A/C compressor and water pump to lessen the burden on the gasoline motor. I assume this will make the GLE more responsive and more eager to attack as you bury the throttle.
The base model GLE 350 and GLE 4MATIC make do with a smaller turbocharged 2.0-liter four-banger. It summons 255 horsepower and 273 lb-ft. of torque. Each engine is bolted to an AMG-spec nine-speed automatic. The EQ Boost system is only available on the GLE 450 4MATIC with the 3.0-liter inline-six motor.
[bctt tweet=”It is all creepily high-tech inside the GLE. The features will make you think twice about bashing this SUV on a nearby dirt road or off-road trail!” username=”Automoblog”]
On & Off-Road Supremacy
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE definitely looks like a luxury SUV with a long wheelbase and short overhangs. It also comes with ultra-bright LED headlights, 19 to 22-inch wheels, and chrome surrounds on the windows. But with an upright radiator grille, chrome-plated front underguards, and a large hood with twin power domes, there is no mistaking the go-anywhere capabilities.
“The new GLE is not only more comfortable than ever before on the road, but also shows its superior off-road character off the beaten track,” explained Ola Källenius, responsible for corporate research at Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz Cars development. “This alone shows our determination to reinforce our claim to leadership in the SUV segment.”

All trim models come with the 4MATIC intelligent all-wheel drive system. The base model gets a mechanical transfer case that feeds the torque an even 50:50 between the front and rear wheels. Higher trim models receive an electronically-controlled multi-disc clutch which can transfer 100 percent of the available torque between the front and rear axles. The torque-on-demand transfer case can also enhance handling on paved roads.
New E-Active Body Control Suspension
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE comes optional with the E-Active Body Control Suspension. This new system is developed in-house by Mercedes. It works in harmony with the AIRMATIC suspension to enhance ride comfort, grip, and agility. According to Mercedes-Benz, it’s the only system available that allows the spring and damping forces to be individually controlled at each wheel.
The newly-developed suspension also offers a unique free-driving mode. It can raise or lower the suspension automatically to change the ground pressure on each tire. The theory is to help the SUV if it gets stuck in a mud pit or sand dune.
The new suspension system allows the SUV to lean into bends similar to a motorcycle. The result is sharper cornering and more confident handling even at higher speeds. The system can be equipped with a stereo camera that scans the road surfaces too. This allows the suspension to react in advance.
Of course, if all this tech wizardry scares you, the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE can also be fitted with a conventional suspension.
Next-Generation Driver Assistance Systems
No new Mercedes is complete without an array of clever driver-assistance features. The Active Distant Assist system recognizes and responds to traffic jams or slow-moving traffic.
The Active Stop-and-Go Assist feature is also great for traffic jams, helping drivers maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. It can haul the SUV to a complete stop and get it moving once again, up to one minute after coming to a stop. And it can do this without any inputs from the driver.
The new GLE comes with the latest generation of MBUX, or Mercedes-Benz User Experience. It has two large 12.3-inch screens arranged in-line for a widescreen viewing angle. The system even supports hand gestures courtesy of the MBUX Interior Assistant. It is all creepily high-tech inside the GLE. The features will make you think twice about bashing this SUV on a nearby dirt road or off-road trail!
Spacious Accommodations
The new Mercedes-Benz GLE is a huge step up from the previous model. With a 3.1-inch longer wheelbase, interior spaciousness improves. The extra room also allows enough space to fit an optional third-row seat. The front seats are electrically-adjustable and offer different seating kinetics for better comfort. The seats adapt to changes in posture by allowing minute movements in the backrest and seat cushion.

2018/09/29,2019 Genesis G70 Racks Up Features But Easy On Price,"The 2019 Genesis G70 offers two engines and six different trim levels. 
A special manual transmission Sport package is available starting at $34,900. 
As Genesis begins making more headway in the luxury car market, how will they stand up? 
Genesis, the Hyundai sub-brand that is to the Korean automaker what Lexus, Acura, and Infiniti are to their Japanese parents, just announced pricing for its G70. The 2019 Genesis G70 is aimed squarely at competitors like the BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Unlike those heavyweights, the G70 costs about as much as a minivan.
Look, I’m going to be right up front here: The Genesis G70 is a very good car, but no one is going to be pining for it like a long lost love 50 years from now. Competence only gets you so far. It gets you loyalty and devotion, but it rarely gets you love.
Then again, competence can earn you lots of sales.
Trim Levels & Engines
The 2019 Genesis G70, which has been on sale in its home market for a while, is now available in the United States. You get your choice of two engines. Either a 2.0T inline four-cylinder turbo, or a 3.3T V6 twin-turbo mill. If you go with the 2.0 four-banger, you get your choice of six liberally equipped trim levels, starting at $34,900.
Trim levels include Advanced, Elite, Prestige, Dynamic, Sport, and Sport M/T.
The 3.3T plant gets four trim levels, plus two limited-production Special Edition models, all starting at $43,750. These are tagged as Advanced, Elite, Prestige, and Sport. The limited-production 3.3T packages are called Dynamic Special Edition and Design Special Edition. Yes, that’s pretentious, but if you’re angling for the perspective Mercedes or BMW driver, a little pretention is probably called for.
For some reason, Genesis is limiting the production on these to only 400 units.
Well, at least “limited” is not just a sticker they slap on the bumper.
Point Blank Performance
Power-wise, the engines are pretty impressive. The 2.0T four-cylinder turbo puts out 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. That’s a lot of muscle squeezed from a half gallon of displacement. The 3.3T is similarly impressive, with 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft. of torque on tap. Thank you Genesis.
Across all the trim levels, there’s a lot of overlap in terms of features. So let’s just look at either end of the G70 spectrum.
At the low end (and I’m using that term relatively here), the 2.0T Advanced RWD comes with Shift-by-Wire technology, held up by a MacPherson strut front and a multi-link rear suspension. The power-steering system is rack-mounted and motor-driven. Wheels are 18-inch alloys with Michelin all-season P225/45R18 tires. An eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters and rev match is available.

The brakes are ventilated, of course.
Interior Comforts & Tech Treatments
The interior features stainless steel front door sill plates, dual automatic climate controls, a 12-way power driver’s seat (including four-way lumbar), and an eight-way power passenger seat. Perforated leather wraps the tilting and telescoping steering wheel and shift knob. The front vanity mirrors are illuminated and have sliding sun visors.
There’s also a front map and pin light (not sure what that is). The rear seat is a 60/40 split-folding deal. Audio, cruise, and phone controls are located on the steering wheel.
There’s a rearview camera with parking guidelines and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror with HomeLink. Leatherette seating surfaces, rear folding armrest with cup holders, and a Bluetooth hands-free phone system are included. Multimedia? Tons: HD Radio, seven-inch color LCD multi-information screen, two front USB ports, and another one in the rear. There is even Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.
Remember, this is lowest level of stuff (and there’s even more yet). You get all of this on a 2019 Genesis G70 starting right around $35,000! Well, tack on another $995 for destination, but still.
And There’s More . . .
The 3.3T models add stuff like a multi-plate type limited-slip differential, Brembo brakes, dual exhaust, a sport-tuned suspension, alloy pedals, and full LED headlights. And the Genesis logo approach lights too (show offs!). Along with the navigation, there is something called the “front passenger seat walk-in device.” No, I don’t know either.
But there is also a high-zoot Lexicon 15-speaker audio system with Quantum Logic Surround and Clari-Fi Music Restoration Technology.
Price Range
The aforementioned 2.0T Advanced RWD starts at $34,900 with the Dynamic AWD Launch Edition running $52,250 at the top of the mountain. In the middle of the range are the 3.3T Advanced RWD and AWD at $34,750 and $45,750 respectively.

2018/09/28,"2019 Subaru BRZ: Still Lacking Power, But Still Good Enough","Nice as it would be, the 2019 Subaru BRZ does not see a horsepower increase.
But maybe that’s okay? There are lots of other things to love about this new Subaru.   
Subaru is upping the ante with the introduction of the 2019 BRZ. More power right?! No, just kidding. Instead of tooling around with the 2.0-liter Boxer engine, Subaru decided a limited edition trim was enough.
The new “Series.Gray” includes wheel upgrades, a new paint color, and blacked-out exterior badges.
2019 Subaru BRZ Breakdown
The base BRZ Premium comes with LED headlights, power door locks and side mirrors, rear vision camera, engine immobilizer, and keyless entry. The Premium model adds a welcome lighting system to greet you when approaching the vehicle. Dual USB ports, a 6.2-inch touchscreen audio display with eight speakers, and Bluetooth capability are standard across the range.
Don’t forget the leather steering wheel, and leather accents for the door trim, shifter, and center console.
All in all, not bad. The 2019 Subaru BRZ Premium starts just under $26,000. In truth, I would pay more in exchange for a more powerful and responsive Boxer motor. For the money, the Limited trim offers better value for $28,000 and change. It adds LED fog lights, keyless access with push-button start, Alcantara seats with leather-trimmed bolsters and heating, courtesy lights, and an illuminated vanity mirror for passengers.
Standard on the Limited is Subaru Starlink. It comes with a larger seven-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The system supports SiriusXM radio and a voice-activated navigation system.
By The Numbers
Also standard is the 4.2-inch display screen next to the tachometer. It provides information about the steering angle, oil and coolant temperatures, and lateral G-forces. There is also a stopwatch function so you can measure your lap times, which we assume won’t be blisteringly quick given the lack of power.
But for $1,195 more, the Limited can be optioned with the Performance Package. That adds Brembo brakes with four-piston front and dual-piston rear calipers, SACHS shock absorbers, and new 17-inch black alloys. This package is only applicable to manual models. Sadly, there is no power upgrade.
New for 2019 is the exclusive Series.Gray trim in khaki gray paint, different 17-inch black-finish alloys, and blacked-out exterior badges. The interior gets red stitching, frameless rearview mirrors, and a combination meter visor. Only 250 Series.Gray models are allotted for the 2019 model year with prices starting at $30,140.
And no, you can’t get a more powerful engine in this trim either.

Enough! How Does It Drive?
Same as before, and unsurprisingly similar to the Toyota 86. Look, if you are considering the Toyota 86 or Subaru BRZ, you aren’t exactly looking for balls-out power and acceleration, right? You buy these cars for the sporty driving experience, and not for the boundless rush of torque from the motor. Compared to the Mazda MX-5, the Subaru BRZ is more accurate and more precise, although it is less forgiving than the Mazda.
Do it right, it will blow your mind. Do it wrong, however, and you might end up in a ditch.
Seriously now, both the Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ are excellent in the hands of an experienced racing driver. Of course, you need to get the six-speed manual when shopping in this category. Unless you don’t enjoy driving (then it’s perfectly okay to get the automatic).
More About That Engine
Powering all trim levels of the 2019 Subaru BRZ is the familiar 2.0-liter Boxer-four that produces 205 horsepower. Peak torque of 156 lb-ft. comes between 6,400 and 6,800 rpm. The automatic variant gets five less horsepower and a smidgen less torque. The new Subaru BRZ also comes with a TORSEN limited-slip differential to make the most of the close-ratio manual gears.
Now, it’s not as if the BRZ (and the 86 for that matter) is screaming for more power. It’s how the chassis feels it can handle more than a measly 200 horsepower. The car feels quick but you need to squeeze the throttle to get the adrenaline rush.
Maybe a BRZ STi is in the works? Probably not.

The Verdict
Despite the absence of a tuned engine, the 2019 Subaru BRZ is still good enough. The funny thing is the 2019 Mazda MX-5 RF (yes, the one with the folding metal roof) feels faster than the BRZ. This is despite the MX-5 having a SKYACTIV motor with only 155 horsepower.
But when it comes to precision, agility, and a fun-to-drive demeanor without spending crazy amounts of cash, the new Subaru BRZ is still worthy of consideration.

2018/09/28,I.D. Buzz Cargo: VW’s New Mystery Machine For The New Age,"The I.D. Buzz Cargo has a range of more than 340 miles according to Volkswagen. 
The 230V socket provides power for tools and other equipment without an additional generator.
When is VW going to release it? They didn’t exactly say . . . 
Volkswagen has this on again, off again thing in going with the reboot of their bus. You know, the Type 2, the hippie bus. They’ve gone through several iterations with this guy. All of them would be produced. But none of them ever were. However, VW says this one is for real.
It’s called I.D. Buzz Cargo. What is this? A cartoon character?
Building A Mystery
Well, it is kind of cartoon-ish looking, what with that snub nose and permanent smile on its face. And those huge expanses of bodywork on the sides are just begging for a Mystery Machine paint job. But if you put all that aside, you can see VW is serious with this thing. As they flatly state, the I.D. Buzz Cargo “has the potential to write history as one of the most advanced light commercial vehicles.”
That’s a big claim, but does VW have the specs to back it up?
The Buzz Cargo, like other vehicles in VW’s I.D. line, is entirely electric. The Buzz Cargo aims to be the urban delivery vehicle in the coming years – at least for smaller stuff, like packages from Amazon. Think of it as the “last mile” delivery vehicle from Tesla, if Tesla were one of the largest automakers on the planet.
Payload & Storage
This concept (yes, it’s just a concept for now, but VW says they’re going to make it, honest, cross their hearts, pinky swear!) shows the path the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles division will take. Clocking in at 198.7 inches long, 77.8 inches wide, and 77.3 inches tall, the Buzz Cargo aims to be small on the outside – perfect for urban environments – while being big on the inside – perfect for hauling.
The rear overhang extends about four inches over the vehicle. Maximum payload is 1,760 lbs., or about the all up weight of a Lotus Elise.
The interior cargo space includes a shelving system, so there’s no sliding door on the driver’s side. The front doors and sliding door open electrically, via a sensor, which will come in handy. Essentially, the I.D. Buzz Cargo recognizes authorized persons via a digital key sent to the van by smartphone.
Autonomous Capability
Instead of two single seats up front, there’s a driver’s seat and a double bench-seat on the front passenger side. The middle section of the bench folds down, serving as a work space with an integrated laptop. If the driver is using the automated “I.D. Pilot” mode, work can even be done on the move, since the I.D. Buzz Cargo aims to be fully autonomous. The driver can activate the Level 4 autonomous mode by pushing on the steering wheel for a few seconds. The steering wheel then retracts into the instrument panel.
RELATED

Once in autonomous mode, the driver’s seat turns 15 degrees to the right in order to work better with that laptop. While on the move, they can handle bills of lading and paperwork, and all that other stuff delivery people have to sort through.
[bctt tweet=”Think of it as the last mile delivery vehicle from Tesla, if Tesla were one of the largest automakers on the planet.” username=”Automoblog”]
Augmented Reality
Important information projects onto the road in 3D via an Augmented Reality heads-up display. The information remains in the driver’s line-of-sight, allowing them to concentrate on road conditions. An integrated tablet controls the infotainment and climate functions. The main driving controls are located on the steering wheel.
The rear view mirrors are gone, replaced by cameras projecting images onto small screens in the cab of the I.D. Buzz Cargo.
Does The I.D. Buzz Cargo Deliver?
Other nifty distinguishing features include the new solar roof. This photovoltaic system generates enough power to extend range by up to 9.3 miles per day. The longer this thing is in the daylight, the further it can drive, which should make fleet managers happy.
Add all this up and combine it with the I.D. Buzz Cargo’s 340 mile range, and you have a very usable option for urban delivery services. Of curse, the question, yet again, is will VW be serious this time. I bet they are. After the diesel-gate scandal, VW has invested in EVs big time. And they’re smart enough to realize there is plenty of money in the commercial sector.

2018/09/27,2019 BMW X2 M35i: It’s A Bird! It’s A Plane! It’s A…We Don’t Know!,"The 2019 BMW X2 M35i is the newest member of the brand’s Sports Activity Coupe family.
But what does that mean exactly?
The engine is pretty cool – we know at least that much. 
Drum roll please because here it is, the all-new 2019 BMW X2 M35i. The latest in a growing lineup of those sort-of-SUV/sort-of-a-coupe things that are real popular in Europe, and only mildly popular here in The States. What BMW is after here is people who want everything: a car and a sports car and something swoopy and something practical and something sort of off-roady.
Oh, and the X2 M35i is small too.
So Many Rugrats
The 2019 BMW X2 M35i is, as with all things BMW, pretty capable. But, as with much of what’s rolling out of the Bavarian’s factories, it’s one of a bunch of half-way between this and that and another thing model. I swear to Kurt Tank that BMW has so many M variants and X models rolling around, it’s like keeping track of the members of the chorale at a Wagner opera.
It’s tiring and I’m not sure why they do this.
[bctt tweet=”BMW has so many M variants and X models rolling around, it’s like keeping track of the members of the chorale at a Wagner opera.” username=”Automoblog”]
Power & Performance
What we have here is the newest member of BMW’s X2 Sports Activity Coupe family. The new X2 has an “extroverted” design. The 2.0L TwinPower turbocharged 4-cylinder puts out 302 horsepower and 332 lb-ft. of torque. No major engine component went untouched either. The crank has larger main bearings for better reinforcement. The pistons are new with a slightly dropped compression ratio (down to 9.5:1 vs. the previous 10.2:1). The intake has a higher flow tract and the cooling system has been upgraded.
The turbo is larger and boost increases.
All that energy goes to the ground via BMW’s xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive system. The eight-speed sport automatic with Launch Control also helps. The X2 wears an M Sport Differential on the front axle for the first time ever, and features a Torsen limited slip with a 39 percent lock-up. The transmission has steering wheel shift paddles, M Performance specific tuning, and updated gear ratios.
The 2019 BMW X2 M35i hits 60 in just 4.9 seconds. Not bad.
Suspension & Braking
On top of the boss engine is the M Sport suspension, with stiffer spring and damper rates, and a 10 mm lower ride height. The rear axle carrier and lateral control arms improve driving dynamics, according to BMW. An optional adaptive damper suspension with two different manually selectable modes is also available for the 2019 BMW X2 M35i.

The braking system has these fancy Dark Blue M metallic calipers for consistently short braking distances.
Interior Treatments
Complimenting the exterior design is the M Sport Package, with a standard M Sport leather steering wheel, shift paddles, and sport seats. The optional front M sport seats (buy these) have integrated headrests and aggressive lateral support for both driver and passenger.
The M sport seats are available upholstered in Magma Red Dakota Leather with perforations and black accents, or Black Dakota Leather with perforations. The standard sport seats come in Black or Oyster SensaTec.
The latest generation of BMW’s ConnectedDrive and Apple CarPlay are also along for the ride.
Pricing & Availability
How much? BMW doesn’t say, but then again, how cheap are BMWs? Not very. Production for the U.S. market begins in November.

2018/09/25,2019 Ford Edge: Now Powered By A.I. Technology,"The 2019 Ford Edge uses artificial intelligence to improve performance and traction. 
The system is complex and works faster than the human brain, according to Ford. 
The biggest news about the 2019 Ford Edge is, surprisingly, not related to the hardcore ST variant. Even though the Edge ST rightfully deserves a place in the news, the base price of $42,355 is an issue for some buyers. After ticking the option box for the chassis upgrades, bigger brakes, and larger alloys, the price balloons to around $50,000.
Data-Driven
But what really commands the most attention is Ford’s Intelligent All-Wheel Drive with “AWD Disconnect.” This feature is now optional on all 2019 Ford Edge models, and standard on the ST. The new drivetrain actually utilizes A.I. technology to determine the optimal settings. The system collects information from a dizzying array of sensors located throughout the vehicle.
Depending on the incoming data, the system switches between front- and all-wheel drive.
Smart Algorithms
This all-wheel drive disconnect system is the first of its kind from the Ford factory. Ford says it’s faster than the human brain because it shifts from front- to all-wheel drive in a fraction of a second.
“The concept is pretty simple – it was the execution that was the challenge,” explained Scott Beiring, Ford Driveline Applications Supervisor. “Shifting between two- and all-wheel drive needs to be fast and seamless enough that the customer doesn’t know it is happening.”
The electronic brain is governed by A.I.-powered algorithms that detect wheel slip. It works in tandem with the traction control system and constantly monitors vehicle activity. The system automatically detects if front- or all-wheel drive is necessary in just 10 milliseconds. Furthermore, 100 percent of the available torque can be sent from front to rear, and back, depending on road conditions.
“There are similar systems out there, but none quite like this,” Beiring added. “The fact that we’re able to switch seamlessly and without any input from the driver, that’s the real magic.”
Unparalleled Efficiency
It is easy to imagine the reason why Ford’s all-wheel drive disconnect system is developed for the Edge SUV. However, it goes further than just improving grip, traction, and stability during challenging road conditions.
In truth, this revolutionary drivetrain was primarily conceived to improve fuel economy. When combined with the new eight-speed automatic (two overdrive gears), a 2019 Ford Edge, with intelligent all-wheel drive, achieves an EPA-estimated 22/29 city/highway rating with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-banger.
RELATED

Front-wheel drive models with the same engine can muster an almost identical range of 21/28 mpg city/highway. The Ford Edge ST enjoys a 19/26 mpg city/highway rating, despite a larger 335 horsepower 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6.
You won’t need to apply for a second mortgage for the trick A.I. drivetrain either. The system runs $1,995; the base Edge SE starts at $29,995. This is not bad given the amount of standard features, including Ford’s Co-Pilot 360 and post-collision braking systems.
[bctt tweet=”This all-wheel drive disconnect system is the first of its kind from the Ford factory. It’s faster than the human brain, shifting from front- to all-wheel drive in a fraction of a second.” username=”Automoblog”]
Sleeker Aerodynamics
Thankfully, all 2019 Ford Edge models come with active grille shutters, under-body shields, and curtains around the outer surface of the wheels. These enable the new Edge to slice the wind like a sharp knife over a freshly grilled medium-rare steak.
Other fuel-saving measures include auto start-stop and exhaust gas re-circulation systems. The deceleration fuel shut-off feature cuts fuel to the motor when speed is reduced.
Should You Get The Ford Edge ST?
Consider this: the Ford Edge ST has no real competition. It seems the concept of a fast, midsize SUV belongs in the realm of luxury marques with prohibitive price tags. Unless Mazda or Honda develops a tuned SKYACTIV CX-5 or a turbocharged CR-V SI, the closest things that resemble the Edge ST are the SRT versions of the Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee. But both of those start at no less than $65,000.
With that in mind, the 2019 Ford Edge ST looks like a performance bargain. The vehicle is in showrooms now.

2018/09/24,2019 VW Beetle: All Dressed Up For The Last Time,"The VW Beetle has stood the test of time but all good things must come to an end. 
The 2019 VW Beetle receives a few tweaks before the entire model line heads for retirement.   
Is this really the end? VW says yes . . . but also maybe not. 
The original Volkswagen Beetle needs no introduction. It became a symbol of peace, love, and hope. Designed by no less than Ferdinand Porsche, the Beetle was literally bulletproof. It was cheap, reliable, and easy to fix. It had all the makings of a mass-produced car that could survive in every nook and cranny on the planet.
In other words, it created a nameplate that hinted at classic nostalgia.
The Beetle Is Dead! Long Live The Beetle!
The 2019 VW Beetle is the last of the breed. Production of this enduring model will end next year, but it’s not going away without a last hurrah!
“The loss of the Beetle after three generations, over nearly seven decades, will evoke a host of emotions from the Beetle’s many devoted fans,” said Hinrich J. Woebcken, President and CEO, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.
The Final Edition Beetle is still available in the familiar coupe and convertible styles fans have grown to love. But to commemorate a proper send off, VW saw fit to equip the Beetle Final Edition with different options, unique paint colors, and a newfound attitude.
[bctt tweet=”Is this really the last time we’re seeing the @VW Beetle in all its nostalgic glory? ” username=”Automoblog”]
The Last Goodbye
There are two Final Edition models of the 2019 Beetle: SE and SEL. The SE gets 17-inch alloys with a 15-spoke wheel design, cloth seats with leatherette trim, and a 6.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system with SiriusXM radio, Bluetooth connectivity, and voice control.
The SEL receives larger 18-inch alloys with a retro-classic disc design similar to the chrome-hubcap wheels of the classic Beetle. You also get Bi-Xenon headlights, front fog lights, LED running lights, LED taillights, a Fender premium audio system, and standard navigation.
Both models also feature body-color side-mirrors, heated washer nozzles, and a sunroof.
In order to ease the pain of saying goodbye, all Final Edition models have keyless access with push-button start, a leather steering wheel, stainless steel pedals, automatic climate control, and a gloss black center console. Also new is a three-color ambient lighting system to further brighten up the interior.
Adequate Motivation & First-Class Safety
All models of the final-production, 2019 VW Beetle receive a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-banger, good for 174 horsepower and 184 lb-ft. of torque. The engine offers modest power to achieve a zero to 60 mph sprint in 7.5 seconds. It’s not as fast as a proper sporty compact, but it can surprisingly zip from point A to point B while still achieving 29 mpg in combined driving.
RELATED

But if it all gets awry, the Beetle Final Edition also comes with driver-assistance technology. The SE has blind spot monitoring and rear traffic alert. The SEL adds front and rear park distance control.
Color My World
Besides the usual white, black pearl, and platinum gray paint jobs, the Final Edition Beetle adds two unique colors: Stonewashed Blue (which resembles denim jeans) and Safari Uni (which pays homage to the harvest moon beige paint seen in the second-gen New Beetle).
Convertible SEL models can also come with a brown soft top (except for the new Safari Uni paint scheme).
Farewell, Dear Bug
The third-gen Beetle is a fun-to-drive car that offers decent power and practicality. If not for the high base price and unwarranted reputation for unreliability, it would have been a best-seller. With the underpinnings of the previous-generation Golf, it steers and handles with alacrity as well.
Which is why we’re discussing the 2019 VW Beetle with a heavy heart. Is this really the last time we’re seeing the Beetle in all its nostalgic glory? There’s still a slight glimmer of hope.
“As we move to being a full-line, family-focused automaker in the U.S. and ramp up our electrification strategy with the MEB platform, there are no immediate plans to replace the current Beetle,” Woebcken said. “But as we have seen with the I.D. BUZZ – which is the modern and practical interpretation of the legendary Bus – I would also say ‘never say never.’”
The 2019 VW Beetle Final Edition Coupe SE starts at $23,045 and the SEL at $25,995. If you prefer the wind tussling your ‘do, the SE convertible can be yours starting at $27,295 while the SEL starts at $29,995.

2018/09/22,Ram Releases Two New Trucks & We Gotta Have Them Now,"The new Ram 1500 Rebel 12 and 2500 Power Wagon Mojave Sand Edition are on their way.
The new editions are tweaked just enough to make them standout from the rest of the pack.  
Why have one when two is better? That’s Ram’s mindset lately. The Auburn Hills truck marque shot out of the gate this week, giving fans some new flavors to try.
The theme is relatively simple: bigger and badder. Essential character traits of any good truck, admittedly, but does Ram cut the mustard and haul the bacon with these new machines?
Our gut says they sure do.
2019 Ram 1500 Rebel 12
“I don’t know what it is but I want it,” is an ideal way to describe the Ram 1500 Rebel 12. What does “12” mean? Forget it, no time, who cares, give me the keys, see ya in the funny papers. Generally speaking, Ram describes the Rebel 12 as a tech-focused truck with premium appointments and off-road capability.
“Expanding the availability of the segment-leading Uconnect 4C 12-inch touchscreen is a direct response to market demand,” explained Jim Morrison, Head of Ram Brand, FCA – North America. “Customers have been asking for additional high-end features on Rebel and now we’re delivering with benchmark technology and materials wrapped in off-road capability.”
Fair enough. By the way, the 2019 Ram 1500 is arguably the brand’s most thoroughly engineered truck.
Big Tires, Big Subs
The new Uconnect system, with enhanced processing power and sharper graphics, includes various multi-touch features and smartphone functions. The heated leather seats give way to the 900-watt Harman Kardon stereo with 19 speakers and a 10-inch subwoofer. Is that too much? 900 watts? Yeah probably but I’m not a doctor.
Off-road tools include a factory lift, locking rear differential, 33-inch tires, Bilstein shocks, skid plates, and tow hooks.
The “12” is available on all Ram Rebel configurations. The Rebel in 12 attire starts around $48,700 and will arrive in the fourth quarter. Sterling Heights Assembly Plant (SHAP) in Sterling Heights, Michigan has production honors.
[bctt tweet=”The 900-watt @HarmanKardon stereo has 19 speakers and a 10-inch subwoofer. Is that too much? 900 watts? Yeah probably but I’m not a doctor.” username=”Automoblog”]
Ram 2500 Power Wagon Mojave Sand Edition
The early Power Wagons were known as Weapons Carriers, or the WC Series of trucks. These heavy-duty Dodge trucks supported the Allied forces across multiple theaters during World War II. They were manufactured through 1980, then reintroduced in 2005 as an independent model in the Ram Truck lineup.
RELATED
Automakers Respond To Coronavirus
“The Ram Power Wagon is the most off-road capable production pickup in the market today and offering the new Mojave Sand limited edition will appeal to enthusiasts looking for a truck that stands above the crowd,” Morrison said. “Power Wagon is extraordinarily competent off-road and provides both the towing and payload required in a heavy-duty truck.”
Heavy Equipment
The Power Wagon takes inspiration from the Ram 2500 Heavy Duty 4×4 Crew Cab. Goodies include more than two inches of lift, 14.3 inches of ground clearance, front and rear locking differentials, and an electric disconnecting front sway bar. 33-inch Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac tires and a 12,000-lb. winch? Yep. Mopar maniacs will appreciate the Power Wagon’s 6.4 Hemi with 410 horsepower.
Along with the exterior color, Power Wagon Mojave Sand trucks receive the Heavy Duty Luxury Group. The package includes LED bed lighting, an overhead console, power heated/fold-away mirrors, and a universal garage door opener.
Like the Rebel 12, expect the Power Wagon Mojave Sand Edition in the fourth quarter. Production, however, is limited to 1,500 trucks. Pricing starts around $56,500.
Bottom Line
Trucks are expensive but trucks are deliciously fun.
There is an episode of The Simpsons where Lisa becomes a vegetarian. Homer’s decision to slight neighbor-rino Ned Flanders by hosting a huge barbecue prompts Lisa’s flashback to the petting zoo. Although she feels guilty for eating lamb, Bart and Homer are quick to reminder her, via conga line, that “you don’t make friends with salad.”
You don’t make friends with small cars and SUVs. Kinda the same logic right? Plus that Rebel 12 is gorgeous.

2018/09/20,"2020 Mercedes-Benz EQC: Hey Elon, Look What We Can Do","The 2020 Mercedes-Benz EQC is billed as progressive and dynamic, but is it really?
The EQC is the first in the “EQ” product line. Mercedes-Benz says it represents a new era of mobility.
Is this really an innovative, groundbreaking electric vehicle or just automotive rhetoric? 
With a great deal of fanfare, the Mercedes-Benz EQC was announced, Merc’s first (real) foray into the electric vehicle market. It is presented with an appropriate level of old German arrogance, as if to say, “Ja, ja, Elon, now look at vat ve can do.”
Funny thing is, Mercedes-Benz can probably do what they say they can.
Novel Approach
You know, here’s an interesting thing: I’m a very slow reader. This is not an advantage for a writer, but there you have it. I’m also bad at spelling, which is why I love Carl Anthony so much (he’s good at it and doesn’t mock me). Now, normally, being a slow reader (with exceedingly high comprehension) is not much of a problem for me. Your average press release from anybody, from a game company up to and including NASA, is around 2,000 words.
Easy-peasy.
But the press stuff from Mercedes on this new EQC thing tips the scales at over 14-thousand words. That’s about the length of a friggin’ novella, for Guttenberg’s sake! I tried, really I did. I had a go at reading this thing from start to finish three times before my eyes glazed over. Eventually, there were flashbacks to when I was trying to decipher limited-slip ratio charts decades ago. And it’s not like what Mercedes-Benz has to say is overly complicated and technical, oh no.
This is 14-grand worth of marketing gobbledygook and sentence structure right out of Gravity’s Rainbow.
But what it boils down to is the simple, inevitable fact that Mercedes-Benz is getting into the EV thing the way you’d expect them to: Like a Tiger Tank at full throttle. They are as serious about this as Germans are at any other given thing (i.e. very serious), so we all better pay attention.

[bctt tweet=”@MercedesBenz is getting into the EV thing the way you’d expect them to: Like a Tiger Tank at full throttle.” username=”Automoblog”]
In case you’re interested, EQ stands for “Electric Intelligence,” so we can all get used to hearing those two letters thrown around a lot, and probably for the rest of our lives (if Merc has anything to say about it).
Technology Overload
The bottom line is the EQC is loaded from stem to stern, top to bottom and side to side, with enough high-tech stuff to make you feel like Helmsman Sulu on the bridge of the Enterprise. I will not be getting into any of this stuff. It’s all, ironically, about par for the course. There’s nav systems and entertainment functions and HVAC layouts and all of that stuff . . . but you know, that’s not what’s going to separate the EQC from everything else on the road. So who cares?
RELATED
2020 Mazda CX-9: Quick But Detailed Overview
What will separate it is the electric drivetrain and all its attendant stuff, so let’s look at that.
Mercedes says the EQC is the “Mercedes-Benz among electric vehicles” and yeah, that’s about as ominous and threatening as you think it sounds on first reading. In mid-2019, the EQC will be the first Mercedes-Benz vehicle launched under the EQ brand. Blah-blah seamless, clear design, buzz-buzz avant-garde electric look while representing the fluff-fluff-fluff design idiom of Progressive Luxury. Got it.
What really counts is that this will be a Mercedes when it comes to quality, safety, and comfort.
Power & Performance
The entire package will be motivated down the Straße thanks to two electric motors at the front and rear axles, with a combined output of 402 horsepower and 564 lb-ft. of torque. Range is around 200 miles. The final version will go on sale in the United States in 2020. Get ready.
Mercedes has, of course, been ruthlessly thorough with the engineering. To reduce power utilization, the electric drivetrains have a different construction. The front motor is optimized for efficiency during low to medium load ranges, and the rear motor is there for “sportiness.”
The powerpacks are isolated by rubber mounts at two points and, along with other isolation measures, the EQC is extremely quiet. The 80 kWh lithium-ion battery supports the EQC driver with five driving programs through a Dynamic Select system: Comfort, Eco, Max Range, Sport and Individual. In the economical-oriented modes, the haptic accelerator pedal prompts you to conserve power.
The driver can influence energy recuperation levels via paddles behind the steering wheel.
The Eco Assist system gives you comprehensive support by prompting you when it is appropriate to lift off the accelerator. For this purpose, navigation data, traffic sign recognition, and information from the intelligent safety assistants (the radar and stereo camera) are linked and processed in a bank of computers just this side of Skynet.
Charging Capability
Aber was ist mit Aufladen? Well, of course the engineers at Mercedes have worked over the charging system, making it flexible and fast. The EQC comes standard with a water-cooled on-board charger with a capacity of 7.4 kW. This is for fast AC charging at home or at public stations.
Home charging is done via the now-established wall-box and is up to three times faster than a domestic power socket. Faster still is DC charging, standard for the Mercedes-Benz EQC. Depending on the status of charge, the EQC takes around 40 minutes, with the battery going from 10 to 80 percent in that time.

2018/09/18,BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance: What Exactly Is This Thing?,"The new BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance will hit the United States in 2020 or 2021. 
Performance technology includes a plug-in hybrid drive system and in-line six-cylinder petrol engine.
BMW calls it a “Sports Activity Vehicle” or “SAV” for short. 
Here it is, the new BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance. That’s a real mouthful, ain’t it? Let’s face it, that’s not really a name, that’s a spilled bowl of alphabet soup. So what is it, exactly?
What is the new BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance?
Right now, we only have information as it pertains to European models, but it’s a new SUV with lots and lots and lots of technology. Actually, it’s an SAV, Sports Activity Vehicle, but that’s getting so far down the marketing-speak road. That’s one road I don’t desire to travel any further.
What is worth exploring is all the technology the Bavarians packed into this guy, however. Good thing it’s a truck, cause there’s a lot along for the ride.
Range & Economy
For starters, this latest X5 is not just a hybrid, it’s a plug-in hybrid. That plug-in hybrid drive system mixes an in-line six cylinder gas engine (a long-standing strong suit of BMW) with the latest in BMW’s eDrive technology. Total system output is up to 394 horsepower (290 kW for you metric types), a notable bump from previous models. If you’re running off just the batteries, you can go for up to 80 kilometers, or around 50 miles in non-metric measurement.
The new BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance sprints from zero to 62 mph in 5.6 seconds. That’s a second quicker than the previous model and not that bad overall. Especially considering this thing weighs . . . they don’t tell us, which means it’s a pig (most likely). The top speed on electric power alone is 87 mph, an increase from the previous 74 mph. That’s not bad either, although I wonder how long the batteries will last at that speed.
The combined fuel economy figures for the BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance Jingleheimer-Smith have fallen to 2.1 liters per 100 kilometers, which is, uh, I dunno man. That must be that “new math” or something. Anyway, it sounds good, right?
Power & Performance
If you’re interested in the nitty-gritty (and as a gearhead, I know you are) the 3.0-liter in-line six-cylinder plant puts out 286 horsepower by itself. The eDrive stuff brings another 112 horsepower to the party. The juice is kept in a lithium-ion battery with extended storage capacity. Torque, you ask? That’s over 440 lb-ft. Which is about what an old Buick Nailhead cranks out.

Bolted to the straight six is the latest gen, eight-speed Steptronic transmission. From there, it’s onto BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive system. Whether it’s all-electric, all-straight six or any combo, power is transferred to all four wheels, all the time. Top speed is 146 mph. The high-voltage battery lives in the underbody of the vehicle, so the center of gravity is lower than conventional SUVs.
The new BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance comes with a two-axle air suspension, coupled to electronically-controlled dampers. I’m sure this thing rides like a couch sliding around on butter patties, but I’d hate to see the repair bill when that air-ride system heads south.
Another plus: luggage volume is only slightly less than petrol versions.
By Comparison
Is the BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance the ride for you? Could be. This is obviously a direct competitor of the Porsche Cayenne (but most likely not the Macan, which is smaller than the X5 range), especially the Cayenne Hybrid. So in a lot of ways, deciding which one to get (if this is the ride you want) comes down to personal taste.
The new BMW X5 xDrive45e iPerformance is not a bad ride. Most likely.
More information regarding U.S. specific models will be available closer to launch, which according to BMW, will be in either 2020 or 2021.

2018/09/18,Jaguar XE SV Project 8 Sets Another Speed Record,"The Jaguar XE SV Project 8 has set a new record, this time at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca.
The XE SV Project 8 features a 5.0-liter supercharged V8 with 592 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. of torque.
At nearly $200,000 is this actually worth it? Other cars make similar track numbers and cost much less.
Jaguar is trucking their big, bad XE SV Project 8 sedan to tracks around the world and letting it smash old lap records to dust. The latest victim, er, stage is the glorious Laguna Seca just south of San Francisco.
Jaguar says the XE SV Project 8 is “supercar-rivaling” and in a lot of ways, they aren’t far off the mark.
So how fast did the latest big cat sedan go? Very.
Supercar Rival
Thus far, on a number of other tracks, the big Jag rightfully claims to be the world’s fastest four-door car. And cracking off a number like seven minutes, 21.23 seconds at the Nürburgring Nordschleife means I’m not going to argue the point much. Of course, people like BMW and Audi and Alfa Romeo might. But we’ll have to save those fun arguments for another time.
Or, at least until BMW, Audi, and Alfa Romeo etc. start putting their own lap times on the leader board.
Jaguar says the XE SV Project 8 is the most extreme Jaguar yet. Not Jag sedan, just “the most extreme Jaguar” period. Which is saying a lot. And, with that time at the ‘ring, which is around what a Ferrari 488GTB can turn, I’m not going to say they’re talking out of school with this stuff.
So what’d she do down at Laguna anyway?
Plenty Fast
With North American Touring Car Champion Randy Pobst at the helm, the Jaguar XE SV Project 8 turned a 1 minute 37.54 second time at the 2.238-mile Laguna Seca. But, with a driver like that at the controls, 600 horsepower on tap, and a 200 mph top speed, it’s easy to see how this was going to shake out.
Jag says the new numbers are almost a second faster than any previous production sedan record. This includes cars like the Cadillac CTS V, Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio, and the Mercedes-AMG C63 S Sedan. In case you’re wondering, that’s also just as fast as Nissan GT-Rs, Porsche Cayman GT4s, BMW M4 GTSs, Chevy Camaro SS 1LEs, and Porsche 911 Turbos. All have turned times in the 37s. So yeah, this Jag is plenty fast.
Power & Performance
The XE SV Project 8 sedan is an all-wheel drive beast of a car, featuring F1-style ceramic wheel bearings with adjustable ride height and camber. The front and rear fenders are widened to accommodate the bigger wheels and brakes. The wheels are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The transmission is an eight-speed Quickshift automatic ZF piece. The whole shee-bang hits 60 mph in 3.3 seconds, topping out at an electronically-limited (boo!) speed of 200 mph.

At the flip of a switch, there’s a Track mode for maximum downforce and damping, and throttle and steering response.
As it turns out, there’s two specifications available. The standard four-seat model with the latest magnesium framed front performance seats, and the optional two-seat Track Pack version. That one includes lightweight carbon fiber racing seats, four-point harnesses, and a harness retention hoop in place of the rear seat.
Pricing & Availability
All this can be yours for the low, low price of . . . holy! The Project 8 is priced from £149,995 in the UK. That’s just shy of 200-large in good old greenback dollas. That is much, much more than a Nissan GT-R, Porsche Cayman GT4, BMW M4 GTS, and such. I mean, sure, you get to say you’re just as quick in a sedan (and a Jag sedan at that) but still.
For $200,000 you could probably get a Porsche Cayman GT4 and a Nissan GT-R so really, what are we talking about here?
Your money, that’s what we’re talking about. You’re more than free to go and wast-er, spend it any way you see fit, pal. Each XE SV Project 8 is hand-built at the SV Technical Centre in Coventry. The total production run is just 300 cars.

2018/09/15,AutoSens Conference Plays Vital Role in Autonomous Driving,"Autonomous driving is the most expansive topic in the automotive industry. At one time, such concepts were science fiction, now they are just science. And the industry is working around the clock to validate, refine, and ultimately mass produce that science. There is an old saying: “what a time to be alive.” Self-driving cars? What a time to be alive.
Think about it for a moment. All the cars we see on the road today; all of them driving themselves. Society will forever change as we know it.
Creating Dialogue
With significant cultural changes come a multitude of challenges and triumphs, autonomous driving being no exception. Hence why collaboration is necessary as the discussions concerning autonomous driving are great. Pick any single aspect about about it: technology, engineering, legalities, morals and ethics; or the idea we stand to lose our relationship with the automobile. These conversations are nearly endless, and each topic poses as many questions as answers.
It is for this reason AutoSens is needed if autonomous driving is going to work. Fresh off a successful Detroit conference in May, AutoSens, a global summit on automated driving, is returning to Brussels, Belgium next week. The agenda includes over 60 different sessions meant to facilitate meaningful dialogue on the topic of autonomous cars.
“The challenge of the automotive industry is to design computers and robots that can perform tasks better than humans can, while also causing minimal disruption to a system that will include human driven vehicles for many decades to come,” said AutoSens founder Robert Stead. “It’s no easy task.”
Community & Collaboration
AutoSens examines every aspect of autonomous driving, from the supply chain and infrastructure concerns, to the legal, financial, and ethical considerations. Attendees, speakers, sponsors, and participants leverage each other’s expertise during the event, which takes aim at the biggest challenges facing autonomous cars. Collaboration and creativity are the central themes, whereby professionals in the field share ideas and devise solutions to the obstacles facing autonomous driving.
“I would say the biggest challenge for people is trying to understand the different technologies,” explained Phil Magney, Founder and Principal Advisor, VSI Labs, during AutoSens Detroit in May. “This conference has been good for us because we meet like-minded people that are facing similar challenges; we talk, we exchange our views, and we learn from each other.”
“It’s a great community and we are very happy to be part of this ecosystem; it’s an excellent event,” added Paul Fleck, Founder of Dataspeed. “I’m looking forward to AutoSens Brussels and then coming back to Detroit again next year.”

For Engineers, By Engineers
The technical integrity of the conference is of the upmost importance. This way, attendees have a true representation of what is happening in the market. There are no sales pitches or slides; “for engineers, by engineers” is the approach organizers take. Every aspect of the conference lives by this motto, from the autonomous vehicle demonstrations to the panel of speakers.
“AutoSens brings together engineering minds in a way incomparable with other events this this sector,” Stead said. “A real sense of community is what makes it tick. You’ll find the attendees, even if they are doing research on a niche technical area, will be very open to explain what it’s all about to those who are not so experienced.”
Expert Speakers
AutoSens Brussels 2018 includes keynotes from Professor Christoph Stiller, KIT, on Solutions and Open Challenges in Vehicular Perception, Professor Michael Watts, MIT, with a review of the latest research in photonics-sensor technologies as they relate to the automotive sector, and Jack Weast, Intel, on sharing an Open, Transparent, Industry-Driven Approach to AV Safety.
Expert speakers include representatives from BMW Group, Intel, Hailo, Lyft, NXP Semiconductors, Waymo, University of Surrey, Siemens, Renesas, Smart Eye, The University of Warwick, ABI Research, VSI Labs, and Arbe Robotics. Session leaders have expertise in robotics, computer vision, automotive electronics, digital imaging, and functional safety among others.
“The difference between AutoSens and many other events on this hot topic of self-driving cars is that the AutoSens attendees are the actual engineers who are building the systems that will make it all possible,” Stead explained. “They know first-hand what technologies work well, what the bottlenecks are, and what the future capabilities will be.”
Tickets & Location
AutoSens Brussels 2018 takes place inside the city’s famous AutoWorld Museum, September 17th through the 20th. Tickets, including discount packages for females in the engineering community, are available now. The event’s full agenda and speaker lineup can be found here. The AutoSens Awards, also held in Brussels, are set for the evening of September 19th.
“It’s a community and what AutoSens does is bring that community together twice a year; once in Detroit in May and again in September in Brussels,” Stead said. “We see a lot of the same faces coming back – it’s kind of like seeing the family twice a year – but it is growing and there are new people coming too.”

2018/09/14,2019 Cadillac XT4: Baby Escalade? Or Something Else Entirely?,"The 2019 Cadillac XT4 has strong competition but will enter the market with promising technology. 
There are just a handful of SUVs in Cadillac’s lineup. The full-size Escalade is still the default choice for rap artists, movie stars, or large families. The midsize XT5 is just right for the daily commute and the forthcoming XT6 will provide you a third row if you need extra passenger space. But if you were hankering for a more affordable compact SUV with Cadillac-levels of luxury, the XT4 is the answer. Depending on your perception, the 2019 Cadillac XT4 is either a scaled-down version of the XT5 or a baby Escalade.
Whatever it is, the XT4 is here to stay.
“The new Cadillac XT4 brings a new vitality to Cadillac in one of the industry’s fastest-growing segments,” said Steve Carlisle, Cadillac President. “It pairs the agility of our award-winning sports sedans with a youthful SUV character.”
The 2019 XT4 is Cadillac’s first-ever foray in the compact SUV segment, going head-to-head with premium contenders such as the BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC, Lexus NX, and Audi Q5. But unlike the aforementioned competitors, the 2019 Cadillac XT4 starts at a lower base price.
Motivated By Technology
Everything about the new XT4 centers around technology. For example, it has a 2.0-liter turbocharged motor that produces 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. The twin-scroll turbocharger significantly enhances low-end torque.
“The advantage of turbocharging is power when you need it and efficiency when you don’t,” said Kris Keary, 2.0L Turbo Assistant Chief Engineer. “In the XT4, it translates as confident performance in all scenarios.”
Despite the aggressive engine tuning, the XT4 delivers 24/31 city/highway mpg. This partly due to the smart design of the motor. Cadillac designed a unique and innovative double-overhead tri-power valvetrain with three operating modes: high valve lift, low valve lift, and active fuel management. In high valve lift, the engine works with the turbocharger to deliver maximum thrills. The low valve mode is the default setting in normal driving. It provides a nice balance between power and fuel economy.
Active fuel management can disable two of the four cylinders when idling in traffic for greater efficiency.
“The unique valvetrain design complements the turbocharging system to make the most of the engine’s available power at all speeds,” Keary continued. “It’s a seamless integration of technologies that drivers experience as satisfying, confident performance throughout the entire engine operating range.”
The high-tech engine is bolted to a nine-speed automatic transmission. The motor also benefits from active thermal management, an electric water pump, and stop/start technology.

Brand New Architecture
The 2019 Cadillac XT4’s chassis is constructed from press-hardened high-strength steel. The MacPherson strut front and five-link rear independent suspension are tuned for better handling and comfort. The XT4 Sport trim can be equipped with Cadillac’s Active Sport Suspension system. It offers continuous damping control by seamlessly adjusting the damping forces every two milliseconds.
The refined and solid feel of the new XT4 is further enhanced by a vibration absorber tucked between the airbag and steering wheel. It can filter out unnecessary vibrations without negatively affecting the steering, according to Cadillac.
The 2019 Cadillac XT4 has an optional twin-clutch all-wheel drive system, controlled via the Driver Mode Select System. The system balances the amount of torque at each wheel for greater traction and control when the weather gets dicey. By contrast, it automatically decouples the rear axle in normal driving conditions.
Roomy & Spacious Interior
If you need a simple reason why you should choose the Cadillac XT4, it would be the interior, particularly in the rear quarters. The new XT4 is strictly a five-seater, but it serves up best-in-class rear-seat legroom and headroom, according to Cadillac. The 22.5 cubic-feet of cargo space makes it practical. Fold the rear seats down and you get 48.9 cubic-feet of space, more than what the Lexus NX has to offer.
More Features For The Money
The 2019 Cadillac XT4 in base trim starts at $35,790. This includes LED headlamps and taillights, power front seats, 18-inch wheels, remote start, a seven-speaker audio system, and dual zone climate control. You also get an eight-inch high-resolution center display with voice and rotary controls. The interior comes with with four USB ports and wireless charging for compatible smartphones.
On the safety front, the XT4 comes with eight airbags, 10-years of Cadillac Connected Access, rearview camera, brake assist, traction and stability control, and tire pressure monitoring.
Higher trim models get larger alloys, leather upholstery, lane change alert with lane departure warning, front and rear park assist, and an HD surround camera.
The 2019 Cadillac XT4 will arrive at dealerships this fall.

2018/09/14,2019 Acura ILX: A Budget-Friendly & Sporty Luxury Sedan,"The 2019 Acura ILX stands out when compared to prior model years. 
Although the engine could use a bit more power, the tech and safety features are solid. 
Out with the old, in with the new. The refreshed 2019 Acura ILX is more than a posh Civic. It is a budget-oriented choice in the niche of small, premium sedans. I’ve noticed two types of buyers during my many years writing about cars: those that truly know their stuff and those who simply want a nice car.
If you belong to the latter, take a second look at the 2019 Acura ILX. It may not steal the spotlight from the Mercedes-Benz CLA or Audi A3, but it deserves a rightful place at the podium.
The Acura will be more reliable and less expensive to maintain. For example, the new ILX earned a Power Circle Rating of 5 out of 5 and a quality award in the Small Premium Car segment in J.D. Power and Associates 2018 U.S. Initial Quality Study (IQS). It also captured the top spot in Kelly Blue Book’s 5-Year Cost to Own Luxury Brand Awards.
Best of all, the 2019 Acura ILX comes standard with active safety technology courtesy of AcuraWatch.
Enhanced Styling
Those who think the previous ILX was a bit dull in the styling department will have a change of heart. The most prominent enhancements are found in front. The 2019 Acura ILX is all-new from nose to A-pillars, anchored by the brand’s signature Diamond Pentagon Grille. Combined with the new jewel-eye LED headlamps and sculpted hood, there’s no doubt the Acura ILX is ready for some serious action.
The rear still bears a striking resemblance to the deck of the Mercedes CLS. There are new LED taillights to match the hi-tech look in the front. There’s a new rear diffuser and chrome exhaust tip. Also new are the sharp-looking 17-inch five-spoke wheels. The 2019 ILX A-Spec gets bigger 18-inch rollers and lower-profile rubber.
Sporty & Luxurious Interior
The interior of the 2019 Acura ILX is equally impressive. You get restyled and reshaped sport seating in the front and rear. The seats can be specified with high-contrast stitching and piping for an enhanced and premium look. All ILX models receive a power-adjustable lumbar support for the front seats.
One of the major gripes was the slow and unresponsive touchscreen interface. Thankfully, Acura heard all the complaints and came up with the dual-screen On-Demand Multi-Use Display system. The new software not only improves system response time by 30 percent, but the seven-inch touchscreen display now offers intuitive menus for a quick and fuss-free operation.
RELATED

Apple CarPlay and Android auto are standard as well.
Refined Performance
All 2019 Acura ILX models still get the 2.4-liter DOHC i-VTEC four-banger that churns out 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft. of torque. The motor is connected to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic driving the front wheels. While the engine is smooth at low revs and growls noticeably at higher rpm, it wouldn’t hurt if Acura massaged the engine to produce a bit more power.
It can still scoot to 60 mph in less than seven seconds, which is average for this class.
A stronger engine is (and would have been) the perfect addition to the new Acura ILX A-Spec. Unfortunately, the A-spec only receives exterior and interior updates. This includes dark chrome trim for the front grille and lower fascia, smoked LED headlights and taillights, a gloss black decklid spoiler, and new LED fog lights. The new ILX A-Spec also receives graphite-silver and chrome dash accents, aluminum pedals, and new red or ebony leather seats.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Acura ILX is available now for a starting MSRP of $25,900.

2018/09/12,2019 Audi Q8: Oozing With Performance & Technology,"The 2019 Audi Q8 takes on Mercedes-Benz, Maserati, and others. 
New features include a mild hybrid system and an adaptive chassis package. 
Will Ingolstadt’s offering answer the call for consumers who want a functional SUV? 
The SUV category is currently the biggest and best-selling segment in the global automotive industry. The market is overflowing with choices from crossover-based compact SUVs to body-on frame juggernauts. But in the realm of luxury SUVs, only a fool overlooks the 2019 Audi Q8.
The 2019 Audi Q8 is not only Ingolstadt’s answer to the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and BMW X6. Further yet, it is engineered to steal the thunder from the Range Rover Sport and Maserati Levante. As expected from Audi, the Q8 is oozing with good looks and sophisticated technology.
Stand Out Design
The Audi Q8 is wider yet shorter than the seven-seat Q7. It was penned to revive the iconic design elements of the original Quattro rally car. Viewed from the side, the dramatically sloping roof line mimics the elements of a two-door coupe. The lowered stance, rear arches, and wider track is further evidence to this. It even comes with frameless doors. When was the last time you saw this in an SUV?
The front styling is impressive as well. The biggest highlight is the octagonal single-frame grille with six vertical chrome struts. The slim LED headlights and aggressive air intakes hint at the SUV’s sporting apprehensions. That includes the 20-inch five-spoke wheels and chrome embellishments on the window surrounds, roof rails, and exhaust tips. This adds a premium touch to an otherwise sporty and dynamic design.
The new Audi Q8 is strictly a five-seat affair. It offers ample amounts of headroom even in the sloping rear quarters. It may only seat five adults, but the rear seats can adjust and fold, revealing 67.5 cubic-feet of usable cargo space. A luxury SUV that performs like a sporty car but is practical to live with? The 2019 Audi Q8 seems to fit the bill.
Motivated By Power
Forget those gas-guzzling V8 motors. The new Audi Q8 is equipped with a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter TFSI V6 that generates 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. This motor is paired with an eight-speed automatic and Quattro all-wheel drivetrain. But unlike other Quattro systems, the Audi Q8 is equipped with a purely mechanical drivetrain with active torque distribution. This means the system provides a 40:60 torque split, front to rear, during normal driving.
The system transfer powers to the axle with the best traction when the going gets tough.

It also comes with Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology and a 48-volt belt alternator starter or BAS system. Power comes courtesy of a 10Ah battery in the rear cargo floor, and enhances the start/stop system to save fuel. With all this technology, the Audi Q8 can accelerate to 60 mph in only 5.6 seconds. This is impressive given the Q8 will tip the scales higher than the seven-seat Q7.
In order to keep weight down, the body and chassis consist largely of steel and aluminum. For example, the roof, floor, side panels, suspension, and door sills are all aluminum.
Strong, Athletic Legs
The 2019 Audi Q8 comes standard with an adaptive damping suspension. You can easily change the characteristics (depending on the road conditions) through the Audi Drive Select system. Controlled electronically, the adaptive damping suspension has regulated shock absorbers and coil springs located at the five-link front and rear axles.
Ticking the option box for the Adaptive Chassis Package includes the adaptive air suspension. This adds an all-road and off-road mode apart from the standard comfort, auto, dynamic, and individual settings. Also included is four-wheel steering which enhances maneuverability as a result.
The off-road mode includes electronic stabilization and hill descent control to further increase traction.
Tech-Filled Interior
No Audi is complete without a tech-filled and sophisticated interior. The instrument console features the 12.3-inch Audi Virtual Cockpit high-resolution display. It even comes with a heads-up display with navigation and lane guidance. The center of the dash is home to a pair of touchscreens. The larger, upper screen displays satellite navigation and the infotainment system. The lower, 8.1-inch screen shows the comfort and climate settings.
Every material utilized in the new Audi Q8 exudes a premium feel. For example, Audi ditched the fiddly rotary dial for their trademark Multi Media Interface system.
Even the switch to operate the panoramic sunroof looks expensive and well-made.
Ambient music comes courtesy of a Bang & Olufsen premium 3D sound system. Higher trim models receive a more powerful Bang & Olufsen 3D Advanced sound system with 19 speakers and a 19-channel BeoCore amplifier. Best of all, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all trim levels.
Pricing
The 2019 Audi Q8 can be yours for a starting MSRP of $67,400 for the Premium trim. By comparison, the Premium Plus and Prestige models run $71,400 and $76,550 respectively.

2018/09/12,Want to be Aston Martin’s Next GT Superstar? Here’s How…,"Aston Martin Racing launches AMR Young Driver Academy for 2019.
The program will fast-track young talent toward racing Aston Martins.
Entries are being accepted now. Winner receives a full factory contract in 2020.
Everybody in the racing world now seems fully clocked to the farm system concept. Something that baseball teams have known about since Benjamin Harrison was president, sure, but, you know, a good idea is a good idea.
It’s simple, fairly easy to implement and, although success is not guaranteed, it most likely tips the odds more to your favor.
Farm To Table
Basically, racing farm systems work like farm systems in any other sport. You get talent scouts into the field (or at least pay attention to the racing news), figure out who is hot and who shows promise at a young age, then sign them to a contract. Once you have your hooks in them, er, ah, have them into the company farm system, you can then mentor them, aid their growth and experience, and, by the time they’ve worked themselves up the ladder and it’s time for “the big show” (to cop a baseball term), they’ll be rarin’ and ready to go.
Aston Martin Racing is launching the AMR Young Driver Academy for 2019, and searching to find the next Ross Gunn. Who is Ross Gunn you ask? I had no idea either until I found out he was the Aston Martin Racing Young Driver Academy wiz-kid from 2015. He currently works for the factory FIA World Endurance Championship team as a reserve and development (i.e. test) driver. No, he’s not in a race seat yet, but being a reserve and test driver is the last step before you become a full-on factory race driver.
So, Aston Martin is on the hunt again, and when they find the next Ross Gunn, they fast-track the young talent directly into racing Aston Martins. The winner of the 2019 search will receive a full Junior Factory Contract for the 2020 season. Nice!
Young & The Restless
AMR Young Driver Academy is looking for drivers between 17 and 25, but (here’s the small print) is eligible only to those competing in partner and customer Vantage GT cars. Poor kids need not apply, my son. Judging criteria includes outright pace, consistency, technical feedback, and fitness. Fat kids need not apply either.
The judges will evaluate the drivers’ ability to manage the strategic, teamwork, commercial and public relations aspects of their role, which sounds like some horrible way to crush the individuality out of a young person and make them more palatable to corporate interests (no young James Hunts, please).

2018/09/11,"Volvo 360c: Here’s To Autonomy, Universal Languages & Security Blankets","Imagine working or dining while you “drive” or even sleeping? 
Those ideas are central to the Volvo 360c which challenges the norms of conventional autonomous tech.
Volvo wants to discuss a universal benchmark and standard for how autonomous vehicles communicate. 
Volvo is getting all George Jetson with its latest 360c Concept. They start off by asking, “Where would you live if you could commute each workday in an autonomous driving, fully-functional, connected, comfortable, mobile office space?”
See, plenty space age. How would you answer that question, because Volvo thinks they’re way ahead of you.
Q&A
But, before you can answer that one, Volvo has a few more for you: What if the service was provided via an on-demand subscription basis? Or what if it was provided by one employer yet not another – which company would you work for? Or, to put it in a very blunt, gearhead kind of way: What if you just wanted to get from point A to B and look at cars the way you look at cellphones?
Pitchforks & Torches
The answer, thinks Volvo, is the new Volvo 360c concept. With the 360c, tomorrow will be autonomous, electric, connected, and safe. Volvo feels that fully autonomous and electric travel can offer a variety of enhanced safety and environmental benefits: less pollution, less traffic congestion, and associated health and lifestyle gains for those living in cities. Furthermore, cars like the 360c can open up opportunities for more residential freedom, reduce pressure on real estate prices, and make home ownership more affordable. According to Volvo that is.
That’s a lot for a car to undertake, but, in so many ways, the 360c doesn’t really fit the gearhead’s definition of a car.
The Volvo 360c is a fully autonomous electric “car” without a human driver. Calm down, calm down! Put those pitchforks and torches away! Volvo aims to use the 360c to re-imagine how you travel, engage with friends and family, and how you can take back time while traveling. This, according to Volvo, falls into four potential applications: sleeping environment, mobile office, living room, and entertainment space.
Volvo foresees a production version of the 360c as an attractive travel option versus air, bus, and train services, and with competitive advantages in comfort, convenience, and privacy.
Taming The Wild West
Autonomous driving and safety tech are closely linked if not outright overlapping. And, combined, these sibling technologies have the potential to deliver significant improvements in traffic safety. With this potential, the Swedes also note that one of the main challenges is setting a new, global standard for how autonomous vehicles can safely communicate with all other road users.

In other words, for a while, it’ll be the wild west out there with old cars and trucks and buses and pedestrians and such, all mixing in with semi-autonomous cars and, eventually, fully autonomous cars. In such situations, it will no longer be possible to make eye contact with another driver, a vital element of today’s traffic interaction.
The short version: autonomous cars will have to figure out how to do stuff like that.
“When the Wright brothers took to the skies in 1903, they did not have a clue about what modern air travel would look like,” said Mårten Levenstam, Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Volvo Cars. “We do not know what the future of autonomous drive will hold, but it will have a profound impact on how people travel, how we design our cities, and how we use infrastructure. We regard the 360c as a conversation starter, with more ideas and answers to come as we learn more.”
Lights & Sounds
Some of what the 360c sets out to explore is how to establish safe communication standards between fully autonomous cars and other road users. And done in a way that consumers do not have to consider the brand of individual autonomous cars. That’s nice of Volvo.
Their answer is a system of external sounds, colors, visuals, and movements to communicate the vehicle’s intentions. It will, at all times, be clear what the car will do next, or so says Volvo.
“We strongly believe this communication method should be a universal standard, so all road users can communicate easily with any autonomous car, regardless of which maker built it,” explained Malin Ekholm, Vice President, Volvo Cars Safety Centre. “Our research shows this is the safest way for fully autonomous cars to communicate with other road users.”
Security Blankets
Like I said, Volvo figures the 360c presents four potential uses for autonomous driving: sleeping environment, mobile office, living room, and entertainment space. Obviously, being a fat, lazy American, I will go for the sleeping option.
But think about what you’d have to do to make a normal bed safe to travel in at highway speeds. (Volvo has).
You’re lying down, so that means normal seatbelts won’t work. Volvo’s safety engineers have come up with a special safety blanket that envisions a restraining system that works just like the three-point safety belt, but is adjusted to people lying down while traveling.
“Autonomous vehicle concepts have a tendency to become a technology showcase instead of a vision of how people use it,” said Robin Page, Senior Vice President of Design, Volvo Cars. “But Volvo is a human-centric brand. We focus on the daily lives of our customers and how we can make them better. The 360c is the next iteration of this approach.”

Sounds good, but they’ve got to come up with a better name than “safety blanket.”
Work & Pleasure
The mobile office, living room, and entertainment space options are also easy to understand. Mobile office is like a desk, set up with all the necessary tech (so you can work on your way into work). The living room, a cluster of seating areas, means you can chill on your way out for the evening. The entertainment space strikes me as being like the living room portion of the plan, but with more disco lighting. Nothing beats safe drinking while a computer does the driving on your way to yet another sodden evening out.
“Autonomous drive will allow us to take the big next step in safety but also open up exciting new business models and allow consumers to spend time in the car doing what they want to do,” said Håkan Samuelsson, President and CEO of Volvo Cars.
I’ve got to say, it does make a certain amount of sense. Especially if I could get a nap to and from the office.

2018/09/11,2019 Lexus RC Set For Paris Debut,"2019 Lexus RC will make its global debut in Paris.
Details are slim, but expect a number of new aerodynamic treatments.
Lexus says the styling is “aggressive” and we agree, until we get to the front grille.  
Lexus is rolling out the latest version of its RC luxury sports coupe at the Paris Motor Show next month. The RC has been around for five years, and from the get-go, has played a major role in advancing the idea that Lexus is committed to emotional, versatile driving experiences.
That may be, but the styling is still a little clumsy.
Styling Wonder Or Blunder?
Lexus says the RC has become a “highly sought-after” coupe by enthusiasts who value performance and world-class craftsmanship. That also may be. I see a lot of them in the hands of various tech bros, so, near as I can tell, that’s their core market.
The styling on the 2019 Lexus RC, such as it is, is an extrapolation of many of the styling cues found on the previous model. The lines are taut and well sculpted, the color pallet is nicely finished, if somewhat garish, but that grille . . . Lexus seems chained to that grille for the foreseeable future. Sadly.
The interior gets a new Dark Gray Streamline treatment for the heater control and audio panels. Dark Gray Streamline is standard on the RC F Sport. In all, you can choose from six different types of interior trim. Glazed Caramel and Black with Yellow accents are two of the most popular. There are seven total interior color combinations available, including those for the F Sport.
Improvements Across The Board
The RC’s aerodynamics, tires, suspension, engine response, and steering feel all improve for 2019. Lexus says this means a quicker and more refined drive, providing a higher level of confidence and ride quality. Lexus further says the RC makes for an “ideal companion,” whether you’re on a twisty mountain road or on the open highway.
I refer you back to the fact they call the new 2019 Lexus RC a luxury sports coupe. Corvette and 911 drivers will have little to worry about.
The aerodynamic tweaks include such gee-gaws as a new fin shape on the side window molding and a duct on the rear bumper. Both improve air flow and stability. There are new 19-inch wheels and tires for increased grip and steering response. Stiffer suspension bushings and new shocks are there to provide additional damping force.
Power & Performance
Now, what about that refined and improved powertrain for the 2019 Lexus LC? Your guess is as good as mine, sadly, because Lexus is maddeningly quiet with details on this front. They only say more will be revealed next month at the 2018 Paris Motor Show.

2018/09/07,2019 Chevy Colorado ZR2 Bison Takes The Fight To Ford’s Ranger Raptor,"Where in the world did this truck come from!?
The new ZR2 Bison is a Chevy Colorado on steroids.
While the Ford Ranger Raptor waits in the wings, rival brand Chevrolet has something in store for pickup fans: the 2019 Chevy Colorado ZR2 Bison. This is Chevrolet’s first ever collaboration with AEV or American Expedition Vehicles. The result is a rough and ready off-road machine that looks perfectly at home in the boondocks.
“More and more enthusiasts are discovering that Colorado is ideal for off-roading, especially overland travel,” said Sandor Piszar, Director of Marketing, Chevrolet Trucks.
Chevy is enjoying more than a quarter of all midsize truck sales, and was the first with a diesel in this highly competitive segment. Now it’s about staying ahead of the game.
Dressed To Impress
The ZR2 Bison is a step up from the Colorado Z71 and ZR2. The Colorado Z71 comes well-equipped with 17-inch alloy wheels, chunkier all-terrain tires, off-road suspension, and a locking rear differential to name a few. The Colorado ZR2 ups the ante with special bodywork to improve approach and departure angles, raised suspension, bigger all-terrain tires, Multimatic DSSV Dampers, and both front and rear locking differentials.
“We’ve been following Colorado since its introduction, and the ZR2 really captured our attention,” said Dave Harriton, Founder and President of AEV.
Hence why the 2019 Colorado ZR2 Bison takes it to a whole new level. But the mods are not just about decals, fender flares, and a new grille. Immediately obvious are the 31-inch Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac all-season off-road tires wrapped in Bison-specific 17 x 8-inch aluminum wheels.
The 2019 Chevy Colorado Bison ZR2 also gets AEV-designed front and rear bumpers manufactured from stamped steel. The front bumper can accommodate a winch and comes with built-in fog lights. The rear bumper comes with integrated recovery points as well.
Superior Underbody Protection
The Colorado ZR2 Bison plays rough, and has five skid plates to protect the critical points of the undercarriage. The skid plates cover the engine oil pan, fuel tank, transfer case, and the front and rear locking differentials. These are not flimsy metal pieces either. Chevy and AEV say they utilized the highest-quality hot-stamped Boron steel for supreme protection against rocky, jagged, and unpredictable terrain.
“As this is the first Chevrolet vehicle we’ve given the AEV treatment to, we wanted to do something special with the industry’s first use of hot-stamped Boron steel,” Harriton said. “We also expect that Colorado drivers will love the added ruggedness of our front and rear bumpers on ZR2 Bison.”

Impressive Equipment
The 2019 Chevy Colorado Bison ZR2 comes standard with an Autotrac transfer case, front and rear locking differentials, exclusive Multimatic DSSV dampers (similar to the ones on the Chevy Camaro ZL1 1LE and Ford GT), and cast-iron control arms for added durability.
The Bison also comes with a modified 3.42:1 rear axle ratio and 3.5-inch wider front and rear tracks. The suspension is raised by two-inches like the ordinary ZR2.
If you ask nicely with dollars in hand, AEV can install an optional snorkel for more efficient engine breathing. However, this requires cutting holes in the front passenger fender, so leave it to the professionals at AEV.  Interestingly enough, the snorkel is also compatible with all variants of the Colorado.
Even more interesting: Toyota added a snrokel to their Tacoma TRD Pro lineup months ago.
Power & Performance
Engine choices are the familiar 3.6-liter V6 gasoline and 2.8-liter Duramax turbo-diesel mill. The gas-fed V6 generates 308 horsepower and 275 lb-ft. of torque and is mated to an eight-speed automatic. The oil burner churns out 186 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque, connected to a six-speed automatic.
The ZR2 Bison comes in crew and extended cab configurations with either a short or long bed.
Anxious for your next off-road adventure? You won’t have to wait long. The 2019 Chevy Colorado ZR2 Bison arrives in January.

2018/09/06,2019 Fiat 124 Spider: Growly Pipes & Rally Stripes,"The 2019 Fiat 124 Spider is similar to the Mazda Miata but just different enough.
The pint-sized cruiser makes for a fun weekend car, especially in its Abarth clothing. 
Car enthusiasts and Fiat fans should enjoy picking between all the different available packages. 
2019 Fiat 124 Spider
You know the Fiat 124 Spider, right? It’s the current Miata in an Armani suit, but not really. It’s actually more than that. There are pretty significant mechanical differences on top of the Italian styling. And now, improving on that already great beginning, Fiat has done some nice updates.
The biggest difference between the Fiat and the Mazda is the engine, of all places. With the 124, gone is the snappy two-liter Japanese plant, and in goes their rather clever Multi-Air four-banger. They say it doesn’t make more power than the Mazda equivalent, but it revs higher and quicker.
Pipes & Stripes
With the 2019 Fiat 124 Spider, the tweaks boil down to new sound, new stripes, and a new look overall. There is a newly available “Record Monza Exhaust” for the Abarth models. Fiat says it provides an “unmistakable Abarth growl” which is kind of ironic. Miatas, since the first ones, have had their exhaust note modeled after Alfa Romeos, known for their growly exhaust. Abarths? Not so much.
They always sounded high-pitched and kind of tinny to me, but hey, here’s the bottom line on the Record Monza Exhaust: $995. My advice: Buy it!
The Abarth Veleno Appearance Group goes for the boy-racer/I’m bad! look with red exterior mirror caps, lower fascia lip, and front tow hook. There’s also Abarth-branded carpeted floor mats (which look pretty cool) and a bright (but not polished or chromed) foot rest. All this for $495.
Should you buy it? Can’t really advise you on this one slick, it’s more a matter of personal taste than anything, but it’s not a terrible move.
The other bit of flash you can add is a custom, center-stripe design option. Available on the Spider Classica, the new “Double Rally Stripe” is available in either white or red. Also on offer is the multi-colored “Retro Stripe” in both white/gray and red/gray combinations. The stripes will run you $295. This is something I’d definitely get. I like old school racing stripes and more cars should have them.
Three’s Company
So that’s around $1,500 worth of stuff, and most all of it sounds like money well spent, considering the already low starting price of a 2019 Fiat 124 Spider: $24,995. There are three models to choose from: Classica, Lusso, and Abarth.
RELATED

The Classica includes a dual-tip exhaust, black roll-bar finish and body-color header, side sills, and door handles. Standard are 16-inch alloy wheels, Nero premium cloth seats, halogen headlamps, and LED tail lamps. The interior is awash in soft-touch materials on the instrument panel and highlighted with silver accents.
By comparison, the Lusso (which means “luxury” in Italian) gets 17-inch alloy wheels, silver-painted header and roll-bar cover, and dual-tip chrome exhaust. The leather seats are heated and come in either Nero or Saddle. There are Piano Black accents throughout. The 2019 Fiat 124 Spider Lusso starts at $27,795.
The One You Want
And at the top of the heap is the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth, cranking out 164 horsepower through that turbo-four. The Abarth model is all about performance, with a front and rear Bilstein sport suspension, mechanical limited-slip diff, and front strut tower bar. Other available goodies include a Brembo braking system and Recaro seats.
It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: THIS IS THE MODEL TO GET. GET THE ABARTH. GET IT NOW. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT! The Spider Abarth starts right around $30,000, and I think this is the model you should buy.
I know I would . . . just need to talk with management here about a raise.

2018/09/05,"2019 Honda Pilot: Tech, Safety & Puppet-Themed Stuff","The 2019 Honda Pilot is available now.
A generous array of safety features is standard across the lineup.
Although it trails the CR-V in sales, the Pilot is still ideal for families on the go.
Solid Contender
To me, Honda seems in a dilemma when it comes to the Pilot. While they sell CR-Vs as fast as they can churn them out, sales for the Pilot (not a bad ride by any stretch) seem to be lacking. For example, last month in August, Honda moved 34,610 CR-Vs versus 15,332 Pilots. I’m sure the marketing guys in the office are tearing out their hair over this, but, really, I don’t know why.
The Pilot is a pretty good “truck” and it’s loaded with every modern safety, comfort, convenience, and tech feature you’d expect. It starts out a little over $32,000 for the LX 2WD, topping out around $49,000 for the Pilot Elite with all-wheel drive.
In other words, right at the high end of minivan territory – just perfect for those who will only consider buying a minivan at bayonet point. Even with the entry-level Pilot LX, you get lots of bang for your buck.
New Fashions
First, the Pilot has a new set of duds to wear. The front gets a new fascia with standard LED headlights, while the rear has new taillights and chrome accents. The new front bumper even has larger fog lights for a more aggressive look. The grille is redesigned with a new “skid” garnish on the lower front bumper. I don’t really need to point out that putting the word skid in quotes and using the word garnish means that this styling flourish is just that; taking this thing on King of The Hammers probably won’t work.
The fog lights are LED as are the headlights on the Pilot Elite trim. The rear has new taillights with LED backup lights, plus there’s a chrome strip on the rockers and rear bumper. Wheels are also more ruggedly styled, with 18-inchers on LX, EX, and EX-L, with a new 20-inch design for Touring and Elite trims.
Safety & Security
Safety and driver assistance tech? C’mon dude, this is a new Honda. For 2019, all Pilot models come standard with the Honda Sensing suite of safety features. Honda Sensing includes Collision Mitigation Braking with Forward Collision Warning, Road Departure Mitigation, Lane Keeping Assist, and Adaptive Cruise Control. Honda’s Blind Spot Information System is now standard on EX, EX-L, and Touring trims as is the Rear Cross Traffic Monitor.
Technology & Infotainment
Now, the tech goodies, or “infotainment” to use the parlance of our time is also extensive. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, of course, along with an all-new Display Audio system. Honda says it’s easier to use because of customizable shortcuts and simplified menus.
RELATED
Porsche 911 Turbo S: Most Powerful 911 Turbo Yet
Back-seaters get an updated Rear Entertainment System with a larger screen, and the Pilot is now available with a 4G LTE-based Wi-Fi hotspot. An audio system, gesture-controlled by an eight-inch touchscreen, cranks out 218 watts through six speakers and a subwoofer. Touring and Elite models are even better, with a 10-speaker system, a subwoofer, and 590 watts of power.
Cabin Communication
That tech goodness extends to the profligate use of HondaLink, CabinControl, and CabinTalk. HondaLink connects customers to a variety of cloud-based services. CabinControl, a new deal, is a downloadable app for smartphones. With it, you can control features like the audio system, Rear Entertainment System, and rear climate control among others.
CabinTalk allows those in front to “easily communicate to those in the second and third rows using the rear speakers or wireless headphones.” In other words, CabinTalk allows you to say “Knock that off or I’ll turn this car around right now!!” without having to yell.
Are We There Yet?
And speaking of dealing with insolent little brats, say hello to the 4G LTE Wi-Fi and Rear Entertainment System. The Wi-Fi network can support seven devices and enables video streaming to the Rear Entertainment System. This Rear Entertainment System features a ceiling-mounted, 10.2-inch swing down display.
There’s an HDMI port, a 115-volt power outlet, and a pair of USB ports. Two additional headphone jacks are also provided.
The Rear Entertainment System includes a “fun, kid-friendly” puppet-themed “How Much Farther?” app that functions as a “flight tracker.” A colorful, on-screen animated marionette counts down time and distance to the destination. “Okay, I mean it. You either quiet down back there, or you’ll end up watching ‘fun, kid friendly’ puppet-themed stuff! Believe you me!!”
Sounds great.

2018/09/05,2019 Nissan Armada & Frontier Arrive With New Features,"The 2019 Nissan Armada and Frontier are arriving at local dealerships.  
Both see a few changes for 2019, with the Armada adding new safety features. 
2019 Nissan Armada
The Armada arrives with new safety features including Intelligent Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Forward Collision Warning. Also standard is Rear Door Alert, which reminds drivers of items unintentionally left in the back seat. Further, the Armada’s Intelligent Rear View Mirror uses a high-resolution rear camera to project an image onto an LCD monitor in the rearview mirror.
The system allows for better visibility by being able to switch to the rear camera to see behind the vehicle when needed.
Under the hood, the 2019 Nissan Armada sports a 5.6-liter Endurance V8 with 390 horsepower and a tow capacity of 8,500 lbs. when properly equipped. The engine is paired with a seven-speed automatic. Expect the new Armada in four trim levels: SV, SL, Platinum, and Platinum Reserve, each with the 5.6-liter V8.
2019 Nissan Frontier
Although the truck could use an extensive redesign, Nissan is quick to mention the Frontier’s high marks from J.D. Power. S and SV Frontier trucks receive a standard seven-inch color touchscreen, while the availability of Cayenne Red Metallic expands across the range. The Midnight Edition package is optional for Crew Cab SV 4×2 and 4×4 trucks with an automatic.
The 2019 Nissan Frontier comes in either a King or Crew Cab, in 4×2 or 4×4, with two different engines. The 261 horsepower 4.0-liter DOHC V6 is our choice, but King Cab models do offer the optional, 152 horsepower 2.5-liter inline four.

2018/09/02,2019 Hyundai Elantra: All About Dat Safety Package,"2019 Hyundai Elantra enters its sixth generation with a handful of new features.
The SmartSense features might, for some, ease the anxiety associated with driving in a busy city.
Hyundai has just rolled out the redesigned 2019 Elantra sedan, and to say they are focused on safety would be a huge understatement. The last time I saw a car company trumpeting their safety features this much was Volvo in the late 70s.
And, you know, this is a good thing. Safety is good, and if Hyundai can give us more of it, then so much the better.
New Stuff
The Hyundai Elantra is now in its sixth generation. They’ve sold more than three million of these things since its launch in 1991, so this focus on safety strikes me as a good thing. For 2019, the exterior changes include a new hood, front fenders, front fascia, grille, and headlights. There is also a new trunk, taillights, and rear fascia.
New 16- and 17-inch wheel designs are there, along with new 15-inch alloy wheels on Eco trims while Limited and Sport get LED headlights. The interior gets a new AVN/Audio/Temperature control, center cluster, air vents, and storage tray.
Trim levels include SE, SEL, Value Edition, Eco, Sport, and Limited.
Safe & Secure
But really, Hyundai wants us to talk about the safety features. You’ve got Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist that is designed to help detect and monitor ahead of the vehicle, warning you if a collision is imminent. This system also initiates automatic braking. Lane Keep Assist can apply steering wheel input if the Elantra leaves your lane. Driver Attention Alert warns you of tired driving patterns with audible alerts and visual warnings displayed on the dash.
The SmartSense features on the Elantra Limited with Ultimate Package include Safe Exit Assist. The system sounds an alert letting passengers know it may not be safe to open the door to exit the vehicle. Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist with Pedestrian Detection utilizes the front radar and camera to help detect a vehicle or pedestrian. If you stupidly do not react to avoid them, the system can apply emergency braking. Other SmartSense features include Blind-Spot Collision Warning with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert and Lane Change Assist.
Tech Treatments
It’s not all safety at the exclusion of everything else with the 2019 Hyundai Elantra, oh no. There’s tons of audio, video, and navigation stuff around to entertain and help you. The new Elantra comes with Hyundai’s next generation AVN 5.0 infotainment system with an upgraded processor and an eight-inch screen. By comparison, the last generation had a seven-inch screen.

Presets within AVN 5.0 are easy to use because AM, FM, and SiriusXM channels are now on one screen with the HERE HD Traffic feature. A bird’s eye view has been added to the navigation maps, and you can now get traffic flow and incident data. The Elantra also has available goodies like Infinity Premium Audio with Clari-Fi, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless smartphone charging.
Performance & Pricing
The 2019 Hyundai Elantra has two engine options on top aimed at fuel efficiency and a third engine option in the Elantra Sport that is more, well, sporty. The SE, SEL, and Limited offer the Nu 2.0L MPI Atkinson Cycle plant putting out 147 horsepower. The Eco offers the Kappa 1.4L Turbo-GDI mill putting out 128 horsepower. It gets an EPA-estimated 35 mpg thanks in no small part to the seven-speed dual clutch transmission.
The 2019 Hyundai Elantra is available now for a starting MSRP of $14,950.

2018/09/02,"2019 Honda HR-V: New Look, New Features, Old Volume Knobs","2019 Honda HR-V has landed at dealerships with a host of updates and tweaks.
The six-speed manual goes the way of the dodo but a new CVT enters the picture.  
Pricing is reasonable and affordable – a loaded 2019 HRV goes for around $30,000.  
New Faces
Honda has given their best-selling HR-V a refresh in the looks department and slathered on the tech goodies. It was time for all of those things, yes, but Honda also has to be careful here. They sell a ton of these little guys, and if they mess with the HR-V too much, it might hurt the bottom line.
Essentially, there’s four main areas where the 2019 Honda HR-V has been tweaked. There’s a new Sport trim with unique styling cues and 18-inch wheels. There’s another new trim level, Touring, that adds multi-element LED headlights, leather-trimmed seats, and a power driver’s seat.
Across the line there’s a new Display Audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus the Honda Sensing suite of active safety features now available on EX and higher.
The styling makeover includes the bumpers, headlights, grille, and taillights. However, the new HR-V Sport and Touring get a unique look all their own: blackout trim and 18-inch wheels distinguish the HR-V Sport, and the all-wheel-drive-only Touring gets multi-element LED headlights, dark chrome trim, and LED fog lights.
Sport & Touring
Sport trims also get a unique interior treatment, with a black headliner, gloss-black trim, and sport pedals. This new-for-2019 Sport trim fits between the LX and EX, and Honda says it gives the HR-V a “youthful vibe.” That description ought to make the kidz run for Chevy dealers in droves when they read that.
The HR-V Sport also features unique lower body trim, rocker panels, wheel arches, and exterior mirrors painted gloss black. The HR-V Sport also receives a honeycomb pattern grille, exclusive 18-inch alloy wheels and tires, and a chrome exhaust finisher. By comparison, the Touring borders its honeycomb grille with multi-element LED headlights unique in the HR-V lineup, along with five-element LED fog lights. The Touring rides on 17-inch machined alloy wheels.
The nav system, available exclusively for Touring, has sharper graphics and 3D landmarks. All models feature a redesigned driver’s gauge cluster with a large analog speedometer and digital tachometer. Although, if you opt for an EX or above, you receive a 4.2-inch Thin-Film Transistor Driver Interface with additional information including turn-by-turn directions.
Performance & Pricing
All of this newness is motivated down the road by a 141 horsepower, 1.8-liter SOHC i-VTEC four-banger. All HR-V models now use a Continuously Variable Automatic Transmission with the six-speed manual being discontinued.
RELATED

And all HR-Vs benefit from a new Display Audio system with a simplified interface and “volume knob.” Honda does not go into detail on this mysterious “volume knob,” but all I can figure is that it’s something far too high-tech for my febrile little mind to grok.
How much, you ask? Not all that bad. The front-wheel drive LX starts off the range at around $22,000. It goes all the way to the top of the heap, all-wheel drive Touring for around $30,000. Before all the taxes and stuff that is.

2018/09/01,2019 GMC Sierra Denali: Tech & Performance By The Bundle,"2019 GMC Sierra Denali has new tech and performance tools.
6.2 V8 returns while the 10-speed automatic borrows a feature GM’s diesel trucks.
The new Denali trucks are arriving at dealerships but are not sticking around very long.
Packed House
The 2019 GMC Sierra Denali is well aware of its competition. As Ford and Ram dial down with their own luxury and limited editions, it’s clear the Sierra Denali is not the only sheriff in town. Such ultra-luxury trucks find favor with a select group of buyers. And GMC is lacing up their boots for 2019, preparing to go toe-to-toe with their Michigan rivals.
While it likely boils down to personal taste as to which luxury truck prevails in the hearts of consumers, the 2019 GMC Sierra Denali is not easily ignored.
The Denali is the flagship of the expanding Sierra lineup, which now includes the robust AT4 and Elevation models. The latter are for off-pavement adventures, but for the Denali, it’s about softening the concrete with things like Adaptive Ride Control. It’s about adding another three inches of rear legroom, trimming the inside with fancier materials, and pouring on the connectivity tech. Don’t forget the heated and cooled seats and heated steering wheel either.
The 2019 GMC Sierra Denali is on it’s way to dealers as you read this. Before you visit the showroom, here are some specs on the truck worth knowing.
Trucking Tools
When you gotta tow, you gotta tow! Expect to see GMC’s new ProGrade Trailering feature with a compatible smartphone app on offer. The system includes a pre-departure checklist, trailer light test, tire pressure monitoring for the trailer, and maintenance reminders among others.
Hitch Guidance, Hitch View, and a birds-eye camera should minimize the amount of swear words uttered while backing up to a trailer. The available side view cameras and a trailer-mounted HD camera can provide additional assistance when traveling down the road, or while operating in reverse. Also cool is the Trailer Theft Detection feature, which provides a mobile alert via OnStar should the trailer ever be detached from the truck.
The available Rear Camera Mirror is something most truck buyers will find useful too. It acts like a dual-function interior mirror, in the sense that it helps drivers see around potential obstructions, be it occupants or cargo. It expands the field of vision with a higher resolution display and the ability to tilt or zoom the view.
Bed Time
The MultiPro Tailgate includes six different functions and positions. There are second-tier loading and load-stop solutions, a standing workstation, and integrated hand grips and bumper steps – the MultiPro Tailgate is standard on Denali and SLT trucks. Although cool and definitely useful, the MultiPro Tailgate underscores a new approach for the 2019 Sierra in a fundamental area.

The bed.
The 2019 GMC Sierra maintains its roll-formed, high-strength steel bed, although a revised alloy offers 50 percent more strength. What is new is “CarbonPro,” or essentially the industry’s first carbon fiber truck box. CarbonPro replaces the steel inner panels and floor with a lighter carbon fiber composite that cuts 62 lbs. from the truck. According to GMC, it offers better dent, scratch, and corrosion resistance.
Carbon Pro is on offer for the 2019 Denali later in the model year.
Traction Jackson
GMC’s Traction Select System morphs the transmission’s shift points, throttle mapping, and traction control to optimize performance. After all, a boss truck must have a slick way to disperse all that horsepower.
Tour Mode is for everyday use, while Sport creates quicker downshifts so the engine stays in peak powerbands for longer. In Sport Mode, power steering assist is dialed back so inputs feel more direct and sporty, according to GMC. Off-Road Mode allows for more wheelslip and is useful for higher-speed driving on gravel or muddy roads. Two-wheel drive Sierras even get a snow mode.
The Autotrac 2-Speed Transfer Case, standard on Sierra Denali, is among the other fun (and useful) tools. With a mechanical low range to boost torque at lower speeds, the transfer case helps in limited-traction situations.
Power & Performance
The 2019 Sierra Denali pours the gravy with the available 6.2-liter V8 with 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of torque. A new Dynamic Fuel Management system utilizes 17 different patterns of cylinder deactivation to balance power and efficiency.
The 10-speed automatic takes a page out of the Duramax Colorado and Canyon’s book, incorporating a centrifugal pendulum absorber torque converter to reduce vibration.
Pricing & Availability
Cox Automotive says the average transaction price for the Sierra 1500 to date is $51,794 and $58,738 for the Denali. According to the Detroit Free Press, 2019 GM trucks that have arrived at dealerships are already spoken for.

2018/08/28,2019 Audi A6: The Digital Age Has Arrived,"The 2019 Audi A6 marks the eighth generation of the automaker’s midsize sedan.
New twin-turbo V6 features a higher compression ratio for greater torque.
Audi’s Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology is an integral part of the A6. 
However, Audi is pushing what they call “Digitalization” more so than anything else. 
Digital What?
Audi just rolled out their latest A6 and it seems to be a worthy successor to the previous seven generations of the Ingolstadt company’s midsize sedan. It’s got all the engine and drivetrain goodies you expect, but the latest A6 is all about Digitalization. Yup, you heard me: Digitalization.
We’ll get to what on Earth the marketing guys are up to with this whole “Digitalization” thing, but for now, let’s examine all the good gearhead stuff: the engine and chassis.
Power & Performance
The latest A6 features a new 3.0-liter TFSI V6 that cranks out more power and weighs 30 lbs. less. Said plant puts out 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque. Bottom line: zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. Not bad for a big-ish sedan. There’s a twin-scroll turbocharger nestled inside the V of the engine to improve responsiveness and performance. The Audi valvelift system changes the duration of the valve opening depending on the throttle and engine speed. The high compression ratio of 11.2:1 means greater torque, of course, and also means you’ll most likely have to run premium gas.
The seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic now transfers power to a quattro with “ultra” technology. No, seriously, they said that. “Ultra” technology, it would seem, is optimized for performance and efficiency and allows for intelligent, proactive control of the all-wheel drive system to help “predictively modify the torque application as the driver demands or the road conditions require.” Sure. Whatever.
The 2019 Audi A6 will come standard with Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology. This 48-volt system, stored under the rear cargo floor, takes power from the 10Ah battery to a belt alternator starter to enhance the start/stop system. Strangely a conventional starter is used for cold starting.
The A6’s powertrain is remarkably similar to the new A7.
Digital Magic
Now, about that “Digitalization” thing. Digitalization (which doesn’t come up as a spelling error, interestingly enough) is Audi’s catchphrase for tying a whole bunch of tech together through their MMI interface. The MMI touch response replaces the old rotary dial and conventional buttons and controls with large, high-resolution touch displays: an upper 10.1-inch display controls the infotainment and a lower, 8.6-inch display for climate control, comfort, and convenience functions.
RELATED
Toyota Camry & Avalon AWD: Nice Option But Do You Need It?
MMI search functions are based on free text input and natural voice control. So you can literally say things like “I’m cold,” and the A6 will respond with, “What temperature would you like to set the cabin to?” or, “My Orange Mocha Frappuccino is cold, I want a new one!!” and the A6 will respond with, “Settle down princess. There’s a Starbucks two blocks ahead.”
It gets even more goofy from there, unfortunately. The lower display has “natural handwriting input with whole-word recognition.” Audi says that users can write a word left to right, or in one spot, and the MMI is designed to identify each letter. They make no mention on the efficacy of doing this while in motion.
If that’s not enough, there’s a full QWERTY keyboard for input. The upper display works more or less like an iPad, with drag-and-drop features and up to 32 shortcuts for different functions.
Virtual Cockpits & Big Stereos
And all this is just the start of the tech goodies along for the ride. Other features include the Audi virtual cockpit’s 12.3-inch display with HD resolution and two viewing modes: classic and infotainment (ugh). There’s an available Audi phone box to connect smartphones with the vehicle’s antenna to charge them inductively. Prestige trim levels get a standard, full-color heads-up display.
Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration is standard.
Standard on Premium Plus and Prestige is a Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System. On Prestige models you get a Bang & Olufsen 3D Advanced Sound System, which delivers the tunes through 19 speakers, powered by a 19-channel BeoCore amplifier and ICE power amplifiers with an output of 1,820 watts.
Pricing
Not all that bad, considering. The 2019 Audi A6 starts at around $59,000 for the Premium package and goes all the way up to a little over $67,000 for the full-zoot Prestige package.

2018/08/25,Roadway Deaths Dip Slightly; Overall Outlook Still Bleak,"New report shows U.S. roadway deaths dipped slightly this year.
However, experts believe the news isn’t so great, saying we are merely “treading water.” 
Drivers can greatly reduce their risk of an accident by following a few simple safety tips.
Tapering Off
Driving carries an inherent risk, whether we do it for pleasure or necessity. The National Safety Council finds in the last two years, around 80,000 total roadway deaths have occurred in the United States. The latest statistics reflect a slow leveling off, with the number of fatalities in the first six months of 2018 dipping slightly. (Less than 0.5 percent from six-month 2017 estimates).
While the drop is hopeful, experts say it may only be a “stabilization” of the steepest two-year increase in over 50 years, which occurred between 2014 and 2016.
If preliminary 2018 estimates hold, the U.S. could see its third straight year with around 40,000 roadway deaths.
“When it comes to this leading cause of accidental death, we aren’t making progress – we’re treading water,” explained Ken Kolosh, Manager of Statistics, National Safety Council. “We cannot accept more than 18,700 deaths as the price of mobility.”
Current Trend
Approximately 18,720 people died on U.S. roadways between January and June, compared to the Council’s revised estimate of 18,770 during the same period last year. Another 2.1 million are estimated to have sustained serious crash-related injuries during the first six months of 2018. This represents a one percent drop from 2017 six-month projections by comparison.
The National Safety Council collects fatality data monthly from all 50 states and leverages data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Holidays Are Risky
Holidays are increasingly deadly, the upcoming Labor Day weekend being no exception. The National Safety Council estimates 420 people will be killed during the three-day weekend, which begins at 6 p.m. Friday, August 31st, and ends at 11:59 p.m. Monday, September 3rd.
“Americans must employ those defensive driving skills we learn in driver’s ed classes: slow down, pay attention, and be prepared for anything,” said Maureen Vogel, Senior Public Relations Manager and Spokeswoman, National Safety Council. “Do not let your desire to get to your destination override safety.”
It Can Wait
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving accounted for 3,450 roadway deaths in 2016. Distracted driving also caused the nearly 400,000 reported injuries during that same period.
“It takes on average 4.6 seconds to send a text message,” explained Special First Lieutenant and Traffic Safety Specialist Jim Flegel of the Michigan State Police. “At 55 mph, that is like driving the length of a football field blindfolded. The sad part is that 100 percent of crashes related to distracted driving are preventable.”

Safe & Sound
The National Safety Council and law enforcement officials recommend driving defensively, putting away mobile devices, and getting plenty of sleep beforehand. And remember: you can learn a lot from a dummy.
“First and foremost, seat belts save lives,” Flegel said. “If more drivers and passengers took that extra few seconds to put on their seat belts, it would drastically reduce the number of crash fatalities.”
“We hope these numbers remind drivers to slow down, buckle up, pay attention, and drive defensively so we can get on the road to zero deaths,” Kolosh added.

Safety Tips From The Michigan State Police
Drive defensively.
Limit distractions inside the vehicle.
Obey all traffic laws and posted signs.
Wear your seat belt each and every time.
Be aware of your surroundings while driving.
Never operate a vehicle impaired on alcohol or drugs.
If your day involves alcohol, plan ahead and designate a sober driver.

2018/08/25,McLaren 600LT Gets Stealth Grey Paint & Tons of “Visual Carbon”,"McLaren 600LT receives bespoke treatments by McLaren Special Operations (MSO).
Debut set for the Pebble Beach Concept Lawn this Sunday, August 26th.
The McLaren 600LT is already a stunning car – does the new paint really add anything? 
Special Editions
McLaren Special Operations, the McLaren in-house custom shop that goes by the initials MSO is rolling out its latest bit of special confectionery. The McLaren 600LT in Stealth Grey debuts on the Concept Lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance this Sunday, August 26th. Fine, okay. But what makes this one so special?
Say what you want about McLaren’s F1 team these days (they’re abysmally terrible) but their road car division sure is cranking out the good stuff. And, like all high end supercar makers, McLaren has their own internal customizing division.
You know, for those of you that can’t buy anything off the rack, even if what’s off the rack are some of the best sports cars money can buy.
Paint Jobs
What we’re dealing with here is a ramped up version of the Woking company’s already potent 600LT. Which is already kind of a hopped-up version of the 570S; meaning less weight, more power, and that longer tail (that’s what the LT stands for).
The main distinguishing feature is the Stealth Grey Bespoke paint finish with a Mattee Black and McLaren (i.e. papaya) Orange Exterior Pack to show off the car’s aerodynamic features. McLaren makes a big deal out of this shade and that it’s “bespoke,” but I’m not all that ruffled by it. So what, you did a paint to sample and it’s a dark grey/flat-ish black color.
Function & Induction
Also added to the mix is a Visual Carbon Fiber Roof Scoop, inspired by the McLaren F1, but not nearly as well integrated, visually at least. Yes, it’s a fully functional air intake. Yes, you can hear the induction roar better. Woking has thoughtfully included a track telemetry camera and integrated it into the scoop to record “inspirational moments.”
Besides the paint and that scoop, you’ll also find all three of the optional Carbon Fiber Upgrade Packs on this 600LT. That means the door mirrors, exterior door inserts, front splitter, rear bumper, diffuser, and rear deck and service cover are all made out of the cool, space-age stuff.
There is also an MSO Defined Carbon Fiber Roof and Cantrails, along with Carbon Fiber Front Fender Louvers.
No, I have no idea what “Defined” refers to in this case. Yes, all of this liberal use of carbon fiber reduces weight, so huzzah! The last of the lightweight goodies are the 10-spoke forged alloy wheels with a gloss black finish.

Visual Carbon & Big Stereos
Of course they’ve diddled with the insides, constantly reminding you how track-focused things are with a slew of MSO knick-knacks. Super-Lightweight Carbon Fiber Racing Seats, sourced from the McLaren Senna, with McLaren (i.e. papaya) Orange contrast stitching. A Carbon Fiber Interior Upgrade Pack with central tunnel and door insert panels, and a harness bar and six-point harnesses from the MSO Clubsport Pro Pack. The visual carbon fiber roof scoop cover is incorporated into the headliner, and the twin visual carbon fiber intake hoses for the scoop are integrated into the 600LT’s cabin design.
Again with the “visual” carbon. Is there an “invisible” option? Cause that’d be cool.
For those that insist on overdone car stereos, the McLaren 600LT in Stealth Grey comes with a 12-speaker Bowers & Wilkins system.
Pricing
How much? Well, with the McLaren 600LT starting at $240,000, you’ve got to figure this one is going to be expensive. And it is: $363,500. Although Woking mysteriously says to re-create the car, it would cost approximately $363,500, but never say, exactly, that 363 large is the asking price.

2018/08/24,Brabham BT62 Emerges During Monterey Car Week,"Brabham BT62 makes North American debut during Monterey Car Week.
The BT62 features a new tribute livery in honor of racing legend Dan Gurney. 
What makes the Brabham BT62 so special and unique? Tony Borroz walks us through. 
Coming to America
Okay, get set. This’ll be our first chance to lay eyes on the Brabham BT62, the track/radical street car direct from the great Grand Prix constructors themselves. And, as a very classy, very nice nod to its debut in America, Brabham have painted their little monster up in a tribute to our own Dan Gurney.
Legendary Figures
Now, there are some who do not know who Dan Gurney is, and you have my pity. To say he was one of America’s greatest race car drivers would be glaringly inaccurate. Dan Gurney was one of the greatest race car drivers ever. Period. When some half-bright young-un says something about Ayrton Senna being the greatest of all time, I just shake my head and usually say “Dan Gurney” under my breath.
Paying Tributes
So, Brabham is right on target with its tribute livery in honor of Dan. Gurney was the first ever driver to win a Formula 1 Grand Prix in a Brabham racing car and, just like the Brabham BT7 that Gurney raced to victory at the French Grand Prix in 1964, the BT62 you’ll see sitting on The Lawn at Pebble will be finished in Brabham’s distinctive Green and Gold colors. saWEET!
Design & Performance
The BT62 has been designed from the ground up with a bunch of exceptional engineering details. The BT62 draws on the project team’s vast experience to create a car crafted from lightweight carbon fiber, with an equally aggressive aerodynamic package, and an optimal balance between function and form. “Pure-bred for the track,” say the Aussies and I will not argue with them.
How about an in-house, Brabham-built naturally aspirated 5.4 liter V8 plant? With a power-to-weight ratio of 730 ps per ton and a dry weight of just 972 kg?
Family Honors
Brabham Automotive founder David Brabham, and yes, he’s Jack and Betty’s son, the same David Brabham that is a triple 24 Hours of Le Mans winner and two time American Le Mans Series winner, will be presenting the Brabham BT62 at Monterey.
And, if this thing is at all like Black Jack’s racing cars, it will be awesome to behold; no higher tech than it needs to be; engineered, but not over-engineered, reliable as an anvil, fast as lightning. And only $1,300,000? Sign. Me. Up.

2018/08/24,"Smyrna, Tennessee Receives New Investments From Nissan","2019 Nissan Altima production is underway in Smyrna, Tennessee.
Smyrna Vehicle Assembly is one of the highest-volume plants in North America.
As a result of ongoing investments, Smyrna has produced nearly 4.6 million Altimas since 1992.
Local Investments
Nissan North America is preparing a $170 million investment for the Smyrna, Tennessee and Canton, Mississippi assembly plants. The investment supports 2019 Altima production already underway with new tooling and calibration equipment. To date, Nissan’s U.S. manufacturing investments now top $12 billion.
“Nissan’s continued investment in our manufacturing facilities underpins our commitment to building top-quality vehicles in the U.S., as well as our valued workforce and the communities where we do business,” explained Heath Holtz, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, Supply Chain Management and Purchasing, Nissan North America, Inc.
Essential Upgrades
Further updates include a laser brazing system for more flexible trunk lid welding, and a polyurethane stone guard coat paint system. Nissan says the forthcoming calibration equipment ensures the reliability and functionality of ProPILOT Assist.
Cornerstone Facility
Six Nissan models call Smyrna home: Altima, Leaf, Maxima, Pathfinder, Rogue, and the Infiniti QX60. Last year, Nissan Smyrna produced more than 628,000 vehicles, making it one of the highest-volume plants in North America. The plant employs 8,400 people and has built over 13 million vehicles since opening in 1983.
The Altima is arguably one of the most significant vehicles in Smyrna. That is it accounts for nearly 4.6 of those 13 million vehicles.
The 2019 Altima comes in five different trim levels, including an “Edition One” launch model. The new Altima will feature two engines when it arrives this fall, including Nissan’s first production-ready Variable Compression Turbo.
“The new Altima sets a new standard for the sedan market, and we are ready to bring it to the road for customers,” Holtz added.

Expect a literal boatload a tech and safety features.
The engine utilizes a special combustion cycle for better efficiency.
The powertrain distributes drive forces asymmetrically for better handling.
But is it worth 75 grand? Tony Borroz gives us the inside scoop on this new Audi. 
Packing Heat
It looks like the Euros aren’t going to give up on this big “coupe”/five-door hatchback thing, so we better get used to it. On the upside, when it comes to the Audi 5 Series big “coupe”/five-door hatchback, this one isn’t even “just” an S variant, oh no, this one’s a full blown RS.
Smooth Talkin’ & Fast Walkin’
Yes, yes, an RS. And, like all the Audi RSs out there, this one has a bunch of go-fast bits and bobs, but it’s really all ’bout dat engine, yo! Specifically, we’re dealing with a 2.9 liter TFSI V6 bi-turbo plant that generates 444 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. o’torque.
Said grunt starts at 1,900 rpm and goes all the way up to 5,000 rpm. Beefy!
That adds up to a sprint from zero to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds and a top speed of 174 mph with the optional Dynamic plus package. Our recommendation: Get the Dynamic plus package.
V’s Company
As is the fashion of our day, both turbochargers sit on the inside the “V” of the 2.9-liter engine. Audi says this promotes “engine responsiveness and performance,” but certinately raises holy hell with the thermodynamic loading. But hey, if it works, I won’t complain. Another novelty found in the engine room is a B-cycle combustion process with central direct injectors with shorter compression and longer expansion phases.
In other words, the 2019 Audi RS 5 Sportback has what we would have called a “lumpy cam” back in the day, only the Germans do this with computers and math and stuff like that.
Transmission & Traction Nannies
All that power coming from the 2.9 mill reaches the quattro permanent four-wheel drive system via a self-locking center differential and an eight-speed Tiptronic with optimized shift times. Torque is split 40:60, front to back, for responsive handling and optimal performance. A traction control nanny is there to manage how much of that torque goes where with minimal slip.
Suspension & Drive Modes
The 2019 Audi RS 5 Sportback now sits 7 mm lower and, when combined with the Dynamic Ride Control, things are plenty grippy. Single-tube shocks are driver variable in three stages. The diagonally opposed pairs of shocks are linked via hydraulic lines and, when cornering at speed, pitch and roll is reduced. You can customize your driving experience through the drive select system, which offers four drive modes: comfort, auto, dynamic, and individual.

Tech & Safety
Infotainment? Yup, of course. This is 2019. The Audi RS 5 Sportback sports a smartphone interface with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There’s a standard Audi phone box for wireless charging and antenna amplification, standard Audi virtual cockpit, standard Audi MMI Navigation plus, and Audi connect CARE and PLUS. The displays are unique RS deals and inform you of tire pressure and temperature, torque, horsepower, and g-forces.
And of course there’s lots of safety caretakers too. Standard systems include Audi pre sense basic, Audi pre sense city, Audi side assist, Audi pre sense rear with rear cross traffic assist. Also available: adaptive cruise control with stop and go and traffic jam assist, traffic sign recognition, Audi active lane assist, and high beam assistant.
That’s it? Oh no, of course not. New is park steering assist to automatically steer into parallel or perpendicular parking spaces because you’re lazy and inept.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Audi RS 5 Sportback starts at just over $74,000. Tack on another $995.00 for the destination charge. It’s a lot, I’m not going to kid you. But then again, 444 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. of torque is also a lot, so there’s that.
Expect the new RS 5 Sportback at Audi dealerships near the end of the year.

2018/08/20,BMW 3 Series Gets Wrung Out At The ‘Ring,"Forthcoming BMW 3 Series concludes chassis tuning at the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife. 
Engineers sought balance between performance and comfort without an electronic damper system.
Is testing at the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife legit, or nothing more than pomp and circumstance?  
Say what you want about the Nürburgring Nordschleife – that’s it’s overused, a marketing exercise, that it’s the craziest track in the world, “the green hell” – all that sort of thing. Say what you want but it is a pretty good test track.
And BMW is exploiting that aspect to dial in the chassis tuning for its evergreen 3 Series.
Ring of Fire
In many, many ways, the Nürburgring deserves its fearsome reputation. As anyone who has driven it in Forza knows, it’s a nasty track from several perspectives. It’s narrow, the surface can be wavy (and usually at the worst possible spots), and it’s hard to get around other cars and. Worst of all, there’s little to no run off in the hardest parts of it, hence the fearsome reputation.
In a lot of ways, the ‘Ring is sort of like a public road, which makes it a great place to test cars.
This is what the Bavarians at BMW have been doing with their immortal and beloved 3 Series. Since day one, the 3s have been two very important things: fun to drive and BMW’s bread and butter. They have to get the 3 Series right because they sell so many of them.
New Foundations
BMW says not to worry about the upcoming seventh (!) gen of the 3 since it has just completed validation testing. Everything is new: new suspension, new steering, new braking. And now that testing is over, we know it works and is fully dialed in.
The development process, as with seemingly all things BMW, is definitely geared towards the whole performance end of things. The center of gravity is 10 millimeters lower than before, weight distribution is balanced at an exact 50:50 and, even better, the total weight is 55 kilos less. At the same time, rigidity is up, and the car’s agility and steering profit from wider front and rear track widths and increased wheel camber.
The same is true of the front and rear axles.
Performance & Precision
The mill is a revised four-banger gasoline engine, the most powerful four-cylinder ever in a BMW series production model. No figures yet given, sadly. However, fuel consumption is better by five percent and there’s now an eight-speed Steptronic transmission on offer.

But the main deal here, and why there was all that running at the Nürburgring, is the innovative damping system. These are the first-ever progressive dampers fitted to a BMW. Any cruelty that could occur during hard cornering and such is counteracted gently and precisely for a balance between sport and comfort. No electronic trickery, just good old mechanical chassis tuning for the BMW 3 Series.
M Sport Goodies
The M Sport variant of the suspension drops 10 millimeters, with 18-inch light alloy wheels and mixed-size performance tires. Driving dynamics are enhanced with the M Sports suspension, thanks in large part to 20 percent higher damping than the standard suspension.
The new M Sports suspension only comes with the Variable Sports Steering. The system is specially tuned for the new BMW 3 Series and responds with much greater precision to minor inputs. The Bavarians say you can really feel the new steering working its magic through long bends, and when changing direction several times in rapid succession. Hello lower AutoX times!
The M Sport differential features an electronically-controlled locking function to ensure quicker rotational speed during turn-in.
So all in all, at this stage of the game, the upcoming BMW 3 Series is looking pretty tasty. Although we won’t know for sure until one arrives at 1 Automoblog Towers in Detroit for our own comprehensive tests.

2018/08/20,2018 Toyota Prius: Still Frugal After All These Years,"The 2018 Toyota Prius “Remains A Hybrid Benchmark,” Toyota is quick to remind us. This is not just marketing puffery or corporate bragging. The little guys are amazingly fuel efficient, and since they were pretty much the first to market, they’re the yardstick against which other hybrids are judged.
And good on Toyota for not resting on their laurels. They’ve updated the Prius with all the modes of the day – comfort, convenience, safety etc. – but have also upped the drivetrain.
Performance & Efficiency
The latest version of Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive has a 1.8-liter four-banger and two motor/generators with an electronically-controlled planetary-type CVT. There’s shift-by-wire tech to select, er, “gears” via the dash-mounted shifter. Regenerative braking recovers kinetic energy, turns it into electrical power, and stores it in the battery pack.
In this, the fourth-gen Prius, the hybrid components are smaller and lighter than before. The battery is now a lithium-ion unit, replacing the outgoing nickel-metal hydride battery, and is small enough to fit under the rear seat. The 2ZR-FXE 1.8-liter engine is more than 40 percent thermal efficient and quieter than the previous gen’s plant.
Add all this up, and the 2018 Toyota Prius Two Eco gets you an EPA-estimated 58 city / 53 highway / 56 combined, which is pretty staggering.
Interior Treatments
The interior features dual 4.2-inch, full-color TFT multi-information displays controlled via steering wheel buttons. This display provides a variety of readouts through “Simple” or “Segmented” modes. Simple mode shows vehicle speed, the remaining fuel, drive mode indicator, outside temperature, odometer, and cruising range. Segmented mode gives more detail about hybrid operation, such as instantaneous fuel economy. It shows the battery charge state and gives a bunch of ECO functions to encourage efficient driving habits.
There is also a display showing the status of the on-board safety systems.
The Smart-flow mode for the AC system directs airflow only to seated occupants to conserve energy and maximize comfort. The windshield glass is heat-insulating IR-cut and substantially reduces the transmission of infrared rays, according to Toyota.
Technology & Trim Levels
The Entune system wirelessly charges Qi-compatible phones and other devices. The standard Entune Audio system on the Prius One, Two, and Two Eco includes a Multimedia Bundle with a 6.1-inch display. The package includes an AM/FM CD player, auxiliary audio jack, USB 2.0 port with iPod connectivity, voice recognition, hands-free phone functions, and music streaming via Bluetooth.
Toss in Siri Eyes Free for good measure.
The Prius Three and Prius Three Touring trims enjoy Entune Premium Audio with Integrated Navigation and Entune App Suite: a seven-inch high resolution touchscreen with split display, HD radio, HD predictive traffic and doppler weather overlay (nice!), AM/FM cache radio, SiriusXM, and Gracenote album cover art.
RELATED

The Prius Four and Prius Four Touring grades include an 11.6-inch high-res screen. These models get an Entune Premium JBL Audio system with 10 JBL GreenEdge Speakers in six locations.
In total, the 2018 Toyota Prius is available in seven grades.
Parking Power
If you’re an utterly inept driver that has trouble parking, the 2018 Toyota Prius can park itself. Intelligent Parking Assist uses ultrasonic sensors to automatically steer your Prius into, or out of, parallel and perpendicular spaces. Toyota’s “Intelligent Clearance Sonar” provides warnings if the driver gets too close to things on the vehicle’s sides.
Warranty & Coverage
And all of this efficiency is covered by a 36-month/36,000 mile general warranty, with 60 months for the powertrain and 60,000 miles against corrosion. The hybrid-related components are covered for eight years or 100,000 miles.

2018/08/17,"2018 Ford Mustang Cobra Jet: Win On Sunday, Sell On Monday!","The 2018 Ford Mustang Cobra Jet is the Mustang to end all Mustangs, and maybe the muscle car to end all muscle cars. The now most powerful Mustang Cobra Jet in history hits 150 and covers a quarter-mile in the mid-eights.
The 2018 revival marks the 50th anniversary of Ford’s legendary performance car.
Winning Mentality
In 1968, Ford produced 50 lightweight Mustangs with a 335-horsepower, 428-cubic-inch V8; six are shipped to Holman Moody and Bill Stroppe for NHRA competition. Shortly thereafter, the Mustang Cobra Jet appeared at the NHRA’s 1968 Winternationals in Pomona, California. As Al Joniec pilots one of the six to victory, East Coast Ford dealer Bob Tasca coins the phrase “Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.”
40 years later, in 2008, a supercharged 5.4-liter dual-overhead-cam V8 is introduced for the Mustang Cobra Jet, M-FR500-CJ. Unlike the original, these do not have VINs, so they are not street legal. However, they were the first Stock Eliminator car to touch the eight second range at an NHRA National Event.
Power & Performance
The 2018 Ford Mustang Cobra Jet sports a 5.2-liter V8 with a 3.0-liter Whipple supercharger. Power comes through a nine-inch solid rear axle, while two-way coil-over shocks with adjustable ride height, and a four-link rear suspension with antiroll and panhard bars keep the Cobra Jet planted.
A low-drag disc brake system from Strange Engineering is standard, plus an NHRA-certified safety roll cage, FIA-certified seats, and anniversary-themed racing wheels.
“From the very first Mustang Cobra Jets dominating the 1968 NHRA Winternationals to our modern-day racers, the Ford Performance Parts team continues to build on Cobra Jet’s success at the track over five decades,” explained Eric Cin, Global Director, Ford Performance Parts. “This has inspired generations of Mustang fans to create their own performance machines for the street.”
In Person
Expect the 2018 Ford Mustang Cobra Jet this weekend at the 2018 Woodward Dream Cruise. From there, it will travel to Ohio for the 50th Anniversary Ford Performance Cobra Jet Reunion at Summit Motorsports Park.
Pricing & Availability
The new Mustang Cobra Jet is available in either Race Red or Oxford White with an MSRP of $130,000. Production is limited to 68 cars, in honor of the Cobra Jet’s 1968 debut. Orders are currently open.

2018/08/17,2019 Honda Civic Gets New Nips & Tucks,"The 2019 Honda Civic slides into showrooms, complete with updated styling, a new Sport trim, and additional safety tech. Honda is putting the children of carpet proprietors (particularly the red kind) through college as they highlight the 10th generation Civic. The automaker has averaged a new variant every four months over the past three years.
Furthermore, Honda and Urban Science retail sales data shows that the Civic is one of the top-selling cars in the United States, and the most popular car for the under-35-year-old crowd for eight of the past nine years.
Styling & Performance
Honda says the Civic’s design is one of the most well-liked attributes among loyal buyers. Styling updates include a new piano black upper fascia wing, full-width front splitter, restyled lower fascia, bumper, and lower grille, and a wider stance overall. Chrome treatments include side pod accents and an additional accent on the lower rear bumper.
The Touring gets new 18-inch rims while the Sport and Si trims receive model-specific styling treatments.
The Sport trim features a high-revving 2.0-liter 16-valve DOHC VTEC engine, mated to either a CVT with G-Shift Control or a six-speed manual transmission. Sport models receive a seven-inch display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
Safety & Security
For 2019, Honda Sensing is either standard or available on all Honda cars and light trucks. Honda Sensing includes Collision Mitigation Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Road Departure Mitigation, Lane Departure Warning, and Adaptive Cruise Control.
Pricing & Production
Honda has not announced pricing at this time. All 2019 Honda Civic models sold in the U.S. are produced in Greensburg, Indiana and Alliston, Ontario. The Civic’s 1.5-liter engines are produced in Anna, Ohio and Alliston, Ontario.

2018/08/16,2019 Chevy Tahoe & Suburban Premier Plus Special Editions: Large & In Charge,"You know the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban, right? About the size and weight of a WWII destroyer, they are pretty much as big and conspicuous as an American machine can get these days if it wasn’t made under a DoD contract.
You know what the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban need? More stuff!
Hence, the creation and availability of the Tahoe and Suburban Premier Plus Special Editions.
Large & In Charge
These SUVs are already big mothers, tipping the scales at 5,600 lbs. and taping in at 17 feet long. And that’s the Tahoe, the “little” one of the pair. The Suburban tips the scales at 5,800 lbs. and is a whopping 18 feet long. But that wasn’t enough, oh no. You want more? Of course you do. You’re American!
You get GM’s 6.2-liter V8 moving all that steel down the road. Said plant is part of the new RST 6.2-liter Performance Package. All Tahoe and Suburban Premier Plus Special Editions, as well as RST Premier models with the optional 6.2-liter Performance Package, come with Magnetic Ride Control. The Hydra-Matic 10-speed automatic transmission continues the trend of automatic boxes with a large number of ratios.
Power & Performance
Now, about that drivetrain. The available 6.2 puts out 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of delicious torque. It features three state-of-the-art technologies: direct injection, Active Fuel Management, and continuously variable valve timing. Not bad for a truck motor. Chevy says this makes the most of power, torque, and efficiency across a broad range of operating conditions. So be it.
That 10-speed auto box gives you smaller steps between each “gear” ratio so power under acceleration is maximized. The final drive is a 7.39 overall gear ratio spread with a lower numerical top gear ratio. Therefore, this new transmission reduces engine revolutions at highway speeds for better fuel economy on those long runs.
The Magnetic Ride Control is an active suspension system that “reads” the road every millisecond. It decides what damping changes to call for in the electronically-controlled shock absorbers in about 10 to 15 milliseconds. Result: improved cornering and a more comfortable ride while cruising. Pretty fancy for a giant station-wagon/half-track.
Styling & Connectivity
The 2019 Chevy Tahoe and Suburban Premier Plus editions feature Black/Mahogany-colored leather front seats, heated and ventilated, of course, with a Jet Black trim surround. The premium two-tone interior and the mammoth 22-inch polished wheels make their first appearance in Chevy’s full-size SUV lineup. Other flashy features include the gold “bowtie” logos, chrome nameplate badging, a nifty heads-up display, and an eight-inch diagonal cluster.

The cross rails, chrome power steps, exhaust tip, and a Chevrolet-branded cargo organizer are thrown in for good measure. Also for good measure is the standard 4G LTE WiFi hotspot including a 12-month data plan.
Ergo, connectivity is not a problem.
Pricing & Availability
Cost. Well, the 2019 Chevy Tahoe Premier Plus starts at $74,100, while the Suburban Premier Plus starts at $76,900. Yes, that’s about 20-thousand more than a new Corvette, but, I hear you; spouse, kids, vacation, soccer practice. Sacrifices must be made.
If you’re interested, they can be ordered from Chevy dealers now, with production beginning mid-August. No word on when you can expect delivery.
Additional Discount
But hey, if you want to shave a little off the bill, check this out. Both of the Premier Plus models are available to Costco members at GM supplier pricing. The fine print, though, is how this exclusive Costco deal is only available on 5,000 vehicles, and you must be a Costco member by October 1st and take delivery between October 2nd and January 2nd 2019.

2018/08/12,2019 Audi A7: The Sportback With Two Turbos & 900 Ambient Lights,"The 2019 Audi A7 is loaded and that’s putting it modestly. Even the slightest glance at this sportback is hardly brief. Audi throws around the latest automotive buzz words: precision, simplicity, and functionality among others. Toss in phrases like “award-winning” and “lighting innovations” and it’s either a hard-sellers’ wet dream or one tremendous car.
Benefit of the doubt says tremendous car. Is it?
What makes the 2019 Audi A7 worth more than a passing glance?
Power & Performance
Driver’s who like meat on the bones will appreciate the new 3.0-liter TFSI V6 engine. Gone is the belt-driven supercharger in favor of a twin-scroll turbocharger. As a result, the 2019 Audi A7 blasts out 355 horsepower, 369 lb-ft. of torque (1,370-4,500 rpm), and hits 60 in 5.2 seconds. The new valvelift system and four individual drive modes don’t hurt either.
Audi’s evergreen quattro all-wheel drive is in the mix with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic.
The Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle system is stored under the A7’s rear cargo floor. On-board powertrain software uses route data and information from the vehicle’s sensors and forward-facing camera to determine the system’s output level. Power is supplied from the 10Ah battery to a belt alternator starter, while a conventional pinion starter handles cold starts only.
Chassis & Suspension
While the steering-rack’s placement provides better handling, a lighter front five-link suspension is employed for a more comfortable ride. A 20 mm lower Sport Suspension is available for Premium Plus and Prestige models.
19-inch, 10-Y-spoke wheels with all-season tires are standard, contrasting the optional 20-inch five-double-V-spoke silver wheels. Prestige models offer available 21-inch, five-V-spoke-star design (gray polished) wheels with summer tires.
Lighting Treatments
When Audi says “lighting innovations” they mean it. Two other lighting arrays are available for the new A7 aside from the standard LED headlights/daytime running lights combo. Premium Plus models receive HD Matrix-design LED headlights/daytime running lights and dynamic front turn indicators. Prestige models have the same but with Audi’s laser light function, denoted by a blue X in the lower portion of the headlight.
Automatically controlled at 43.5 mph, Audi says laser lights are 30 percent more energy efficient than standard LEDs.
Up front, the narrow headlights extend from the wider and lower Singleframe grille. The twelve adjacent lighting segments of the HD Matrix-design headlights, separated by narrow spaces, mimic the binary digits 0 and 1. Inside, an available ambient lighting package provides over 900 color combinations because why not!
Tech Treatments
The MMI touch response system replaces the rotary dial and the conventional buttons from prior models. Haptic and acoustic feedback lets drivers hear and feel a “click” when triggering a function. The upper 10.1-inch display (8.8-inch on Premium models) controls the infotainment, while the lower, 8.6-inch screen displays climate, comfort, and convenience commands. MMI stores up to 32 “shortcuts” for easier access to the most-used items.
RELATED
Mustang Lithium Has a Beast Mode & Tons of Power!
MMI Touch responds either by using an integrated smartphone-style keypad, handwriting, or voice commands. With the latter, drivers speak requests like “where is the closest coffee shop” to which the A7 responds.
The 2019 Audi A7 is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, using the vehicle’s antenna to charge the driver’s phone inductively. Audi’s virtual cockpit with Google Earth imagery and a full-color heads-up display are available.
Three-zone automatic climate control, panoramic sunroof, and heated eight-way power front seats are standard.
Safety & Security
The 2019 Audi A7 offers a comprehensive suite of standard and available safety systems, each benefiting from a zFAS central controller. This system obtains information from up to 24 different sensors, therefore creating a digital picture of the A7’s environment to better assist individual safety features.
S Line Package
Dress up for the ball with this available package. Styling details include a titanium-black diffuser insert, illuminated door sills and fender badge, and the Sport Suspension. Airflow to the radiators and around the wheels improves due to the front bumper’s larger air inlets.
Pricing & Availability
Premium models begin at $68,995, Premium Plus at $73,395, and Prestige at $77,295 (including destination charges). Expect the 2019 Audi A7 this fall. Two turbos and 900 ambient lights later, seems like we have one solid Sportback on our hands.

2018/08/11,Ford Enters New “Territory” In Chinese Market,"China, now the world’s largest automotive market, is a goldmine for ambitious manufacturers. As “tier 1” cities like Beijing and Shanghai implement license plate restrictions to mitigate congestion, demand is rising in the country’s smaller cities. Since these cities are less likely to have such restrictions, it may explain the rising demand.
But what exactly are Chinese consumers wanting in their next automobile?
By The Numbers
Registered vehicles in Chinese cities with no license plate restrictions is expected to jump to about 23.7 million in 2020, up from 10.8 million in 2010. By contrast, registrations in restricted cities is expected to fall to 1.6 million in 2019, from a peak of 2.2 million in 2010. The data is according to IHS Markit’s latest China Provincial Forecast.
And like in the United States, SUVs are all the rage.
Last year, the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility noted that China’s midsize SUV segment experienced an annual growth rate of 38 percent between 2012 and 2016. As a result, Chinese manufacturers are packing the market with SUVs, although one Michigan-based automaker wants a bigger piece of the pie.
Joint Collaboration
Meet the Ford Territory, an entry-level, midsize SUV, developed in partnership with Jiangling Motors Corporation (JMC).
“The Territory is a breakthrough for Ford in China in terms of our ability to successfully compete with Chinese automakers for millions of customers that we do not currently serve,” explained Peter Fleet, President, Asia Pacific and Chairman & CEO, Ford China. “Territory is a key proof point for how we will grow in China.”
Officials say the collaboration combines JMC’s market insights with Ford’s expertise in vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing. Ford’s testing centers in Nanjing, China and Melbourne, Australia helped tune the suspension and reduce NVH levels.
“We brought Territory to market with speed, high quality, and cost efficiency,” Fleet said.
Performance & Technology
A gasoline engine, 48V mild hybrid with Miller-Cycle technology, or a plug-in hybrid are among the powertrain options for the Ford Territory. Ford says each will be “efficient” but provide no details on how said efficiency is achieved. Based on the latest data, it seems hybrid powertrains will be the top sellers.
Tech features include a Mandarin voice-command function and FordPass Connect with embedded modem.
Family Affair
The Ford Territory joins the EcoSport, Kuga, Edge, Explorer, and Everest in the automaker’s SUV lineup. The vehicle is part of Ford’s China 2025 plan to launch over 50 new vehicles in the country by then. JMC’s Xiao Lan plant is responsible for production; expect the Ford Territory on sale early next year.

“It will be affordable for young families and new buyers across China, not just the coastal mega-cities,” Fleet added.

2018/08/07,2019 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid: A Mini Starfleet Shuttle,"The 2019 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid is sitting in showrooms as you read this, and although the term “sport” rankles, the addition of 31 ponies in the horsepower column and a nearly 37 percent higher city fuel economy rating does make it worth considering. Of course it’s loaded with enough tech and safety features to feel like a Starfleet shuttle and, unfortunately, has a price to match.
Well, okay, it starts at $53,795, which isn’t that bad, so it’s only an unfortunate price if you have a tendency to covet sports cars in that price range (like me).
Performance Layout
The hybrid drivetrain in the new MDX is a variation of the hybrid drive system found in the latest NSX, which is a good idea. The foundation is a 3.0-liter, i-VTEC V6 engine coupled to a three-motor Sport Hybrid Super Handling-All Wheel Drive system. Super Handling-All Wheel Drive is Acura’s (nee Honda’s) trademark for their four wheel drive layout, and although it’s gruesomely cloying, we’re going to have to get used to it.
How It Works
The MDX’s electric SH-AWD system operates independently of the gasoline engine. There are two rear-mounted electric motors that direct torque to the rear wheels. When you’re cornering, the system delivers positive torque to the outside rear wheel, to aid with turn-in and grip. Acura’s system simultaneously applies regenerative braking to the inside rear wheel to further enhance this.
The entire system output of the drivetrain adds up to 321 peak horsepower and 289 lb-ft. of torque, impressive, and, even more impressively, it adds up to a combined fuel economy rating of 27 mpg. I say that’s impressive because this SUV has to be on the porky side (Acura gives no weight figures).
The seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is standard and is closely related to the NSX’s nine-speed DCT. The MDX’s 7DCT can operate automatically or manually via steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.
Safety & Security
Naturally, since this is every inch the modern Japanese SUV, the 2019 MDX includes the AcuraWatch suite of advanced safety technologies: Collision Mitigation Braking System with Forward Collision Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, and Road Departure Mitigation with Lane Departure Warning.
There’s also Vehicle Stability Assist with traction control, Blind Spot Information, and a Rear Cross Traffic Monitor.
And if all that is still not enough to keep you out of trouble, Acura’s Advanced Compatibility Engineering body structure should keep you safer than houses in the event of a big thump.

Extra Stuff
Besides all the safety and hybrid frosting on this Acura’s cake, there’s some nips and tucks, bits and bobs to make the new MDX Sport Hybrid stand out from its past brethren. There is high-contrast seat and door panel stitching, which seems to be a growing fashion trend these days. There is a new interior wood treatment and both the driver and front passenger seats get four-way power lumbar control.
New exterior colors are also available.

Like I said, the 2019 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid starts at $53,795. That’s for the “base” model, dubbed the Technology Package. The top of the line MDX Sport Hybrid is called the Advance Package, and that one starts at $60,545. No, nether of those prices is exactly bargain basement, but you do get a lot of stuff – tech, drivetrain and safety – for your cash.

2018/08/05,Polestar 1 To Debut During Monterey Car Week,"We’ll finally get to see Volvo’s Polestar higher performance electric vehicle at this month’s Monterey Vintage festival. That’s as good a place as any: there’s tons of cool cars around (a good way to put your new vehicle in context) there’s tons of rich people around (a good way to reel in potential sales) and there’s tons of press people there (lots of free advertising), but the folks at Polestar are going a bit over the top.
Waxing Poetics
Or, at least they are going a bit over the top with their marketing copy. They talk about the upcoming Polestar (unimaginatively named Polestar 1) in the third person:
“Polestar is the new electric performance brand from the Volvo Car Group. Polestar will enjoy specific technological and engineering synergies with Volvo Cars and benefit from significant economies of scale as a result of its connection to Volvo Cars. . . . Polestar begins this new era with the Polestar 1.”
Sheesh, I have expected them to say: “Polestar! Makes hundreds of julienne fries in just seconds! Polestar! Love taker, as well as love giver! Polestar! You cannot deny it!” C’mon guys, is this a car, or is this Hannibal crossing the Alps?
Ready & Waiting
Well, we’ll get to cut through all the marketing hype on the 26th when the Polestar 1 will be set among a lot of glittering jewels on the Concept Lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. Polestar says what we’ll be seeing is the production-ready version of the Polestar 1, so this is what we’ll see in the showrooms and on the streets.
Of course rolling it out during Monterey Car Week is pretty much a gimme, and including it at the famous Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance is a nice move, since it positions the Polestar 1 as a future classic. There will also be a full-on Polestar pavilion on Peter Hay Hill at Pebble Beach and the Polestar 1 will also show up at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering on Friday, August 24th, an event that sees some of the world’s rarest cars shown at the Quail Lodge & Golf Club in Carmel Valley.
No word yet on whether or not the guy that came up with the title “The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering” will get hunted down with dogs and beaten with saps for being an excruciatingly pretentious twit.
Gearhead Paradise
The Polestar 1 will also be seen throughout the Monterey Bay area, so non-gearhead/Concours d’Elegance types can view it too. It goes both ways though, and the powers that be at Pebble selected Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath as an honorary judge in the world-famous Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. So that could make for some interesting discussions.

2018/08/03,2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF: The Bruno Mars of Sports Cars,"Mazda has finally gotten around to telling us what the price will be for the latest MX-5 Miata RF. They’ve been doing a bit of a striptease with this for a while; a bit of curve here, a scent of a power band over there, but now they’ve finally gotten off the dime and told us, financially speaking, what’s what for the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF.
Bottom line: Not all that bad.
One Suave Targa
The Miata RF, for those of you that don’t know, is the power retractable hard top version of the fourth-gen Miata. Wait, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a full-blown retractable hard top, it’s more like a retractable targa top. The B-pillar, flying buttresses and the tumblehome stay up, and the center section of the roof magically disappears somewhere.
This would have made the purists out there rather upset except for the fact that the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF is a particularly handsome little guy. Think of it as the Bruno Mars of sports cars. No the top doesn’t go all the way down, but that 10,000 watts of charisma makes you overlook a lot of “faults.”
Club Mazda
The 2019 RF comes in two basic flavors, Touring and Club, but Mazda listened to us, the gearheads, and will now offer a new GT-S Package for the MX-5 Grand Touring. This means you get a six-speed manual transmission, a front shock tower brace, a limited-slip rear differential, and Bilstein dampers. The GT-S Package RFs will also come with a hand-painted black roof that was previously found only on the 2017 MX-5 RF Launch Edition.
The MX-5 Club offers a harder-edged alternative to the MX-5 Grand Touring. The MX-5 Club comes with standard Bilstein dampers, that shock tower brace, and limited-slip rear differential in models that are equipped with the manual transmission. Other niceties include heated cloth seats with red contrast stitching, body-color interior trim, Metallic Black 17-inch wheels, front air dam, rear lip spoilers, and a nine-speaker Bose audio system.
Package Power
The MX-5 Club SKYACTIV-MT (MT = manual tranny) also has the optional Brembo/BBS/Recaro Package with front Brembo rotors and red calipers, 17-inch dark gunmetal BBS forged alloy wheels, side sill extensions, a rear bumper skirt, and heated leather-upholstered seats. This is the one you want.
If you tick the option box for the i-ACTIVSENSE Club Package, then that will come with Smart City Brake Support and Lane-Departure Warning.
Engine & Transmission
Like all the other Miatas for 2019, the RFs come standard with the SKYACTIV-G 2.0-liter engine, cranking out 181 horsepower and 151 lb-ft. of torque, an increase of 26 horsepower and 3 lb-ft. of torque. And, thanks to a slew of upgrades to the internals including lighter pistons and rods and a larger throttle, the latest MX-5 engine produces more torque throughout its rev range and you get to enjoy a 700 rpm higher redline.

Pricing & Availability
Oh yeah, right, the price. Sorry. The bottom line is this: Right around $35K out the door and with the options you want. Yes, that is noticeably more than a non-RF Miata, but this is, after all, the top-of-the-line. Here’s a handy chart showing how the prices and options breakdown for the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF, which is available now.

2018/08/01,2019 Ford Ranger: Radar Love,"The 2019 Ford Ranger will employ the latest safety technology to make towing easier for drivers, according to the automaker. Ford’s Blind Spot Information System, standard on Ranger XLT and Lariat, can monitor either the truck by itself or with a trailer attached. Radar housed in the Ranger’s taillights monitors any potential blind spots all the way to the back of the trailer.
The system then alerts drivers as other vehicles cross into those blind zones.
Trailer Profiles
The 2019 Ford Ranger can store up to three trailer profiles, including a trailer’s length, which lets the radar system know how far back to provide warnings when another vehicle is traveling next to the trailer. Ford says such a system is class-exclusive and not available on any other midsize pickup.
Power & Performance
The Ranger’s 2.3-liter EcoBoost features a twin-scroll turbocharger, forged-steel crankshaft (and con rods), and chain-driven dual overhead cams. It’s paired to a 10-speed automatic and creates 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft. of torque. When properly equipped, the 2019 Ford Ranger has a 7,500 lbs. towing capacity and a payload capacity of 1,860 lbs.
An available FX4 Off-Road Package includes Terrain Management and Trail Control systems to increase performance during adverse or rough driving conditions.
Fuel Economy & Trim Levels
EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings come in at 21/26 city/highway and 23 combined for 4×2 trucks. As a 4×4, fuel economy ratings are 20/24 city/highway and 22 combined.
Trims include the entry-level XL, mid-level XLT, and high-level Lariat, with available Chrome and Sport appearance and FX Off-Road packages. The 2019 Ford Ranger will come in a SuperCab or SuperCrew configuration.
Below is a short video that showcases how the blind spot technology works on the 2019 Ford Ranger.

2018/07/31,Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320: Because Drag Racing,"Yes, that’s the actual full name of the car: Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320. Dodge says this latest Challenger variant is a “drag-oriented, street-legal muscle car designed with the grassroots drag racer in mind.” To which I can only say: Duh! Gee, why am I supposed to think it’s a drag-oriented, street-legal muscle car designed with the grassroots drag racer in mind?
Is it the Dodge part, the Challenger part, the R/T part, the Scat Pack part or the 1320 part?
Stripped Down
Guess what (and I’m not kidding here) it’s the 1320 part. No really. Dodge mentions “1320” and what it means seemingly 147 times in their press materials about this car. For those of you that, unlike me, did not spend an inordinate amount of time hanging out at drag strips with guys with named “Big” Ed and “Smitty” and “Slo-Poke” Ron and other grease-fingered, knuckle-banging speed-freak reprobates, you will be happy to know that a drag strip is (drum roll please) 1,320 feet long.
Now, it is important to note that the Scat Pack 1320 is not like a COPO Camaro or a Drag Pack Mustang. The Scat Pack 1320 is, unlike those very fine rides, completely street legal. This, of course, warms my heart. Selling race cars to any 18-year-old kid with a big enough wallet? Why, that’s as American as apple pie and phony wars, that’s what that is. Brings a tear to my eye, it truly does.
Anyhoo, what does this R/T 1320 get you? As with all bat-guano-crazy Mopar stuff, it gets you a lot. To the base Dodge SRT, you add a bunch of drag specific components and tech to seemingly shorten that asphalt quarter by ten feet or so. Dodge calls it a “street-to-strip value package,” which is easily my favorite marketing term of the week.
Old School Tech Tools
For starters, you get the TorqueFlite 8HP70 eight-speed automatic transmission. No ifs, ands or buts, this is the tranny you get with the Scat Pack 1320 package. The Dodge TransBrake is in there too to lock the output shaft before a standing start, like a modern version of an old school line lock. This gizmo called Torque Reserve works in combination with the TransBrake, managing fuel flow to cylinders and advancing or retracting the spark to balance engine rpm and torque for max power delivery and launch performance.
“Launch performance” is further boosted by the Nexen SUR4G Drag Spec 275/40R20 street-legal drag radials. The boss meats are all-new and were developed to deliver exceptional grip on the drag strip. Supposedly these Nexen tires give super-consistent run times with minimal burnout preparations, but what’s the fun in less burnouts guys?
RELATED
First GM-Ventec V+Pro Ventilators Ready for Delivery
The SRT three-mode Adaptive Damping Suspension has been electronically re-tuned for the Scat Pack 1320, and now includes a Drag Mode that optimizes weight transfer to the rear for optimal launch traction. The diff is a performance-tuned unit with an asymmetrical limited-slip set up and a 3.09 final drive. Thankfully, the rear axle half shafts are the extreme-duty, 41-spline pieces from the Challenger SRT Demon.
Launching & Braking
A Line Lock is there in addition to the TransBrake, locking the front brakes while the rear wheels are free for a burnout to heat up and clean the rear tires and look totally wicked. The Launch Assist uses wheel speed sensors to watch for any driveline damaging wheel hop when you let off all the binders. Launch Assist can, in milliseconds, modify the engine torque and regain full grip before you look like a total grommet.
Launch Control does even more of the same, controlling tire slip during that straight-line burst of acceleration.
The Brembo High-Performance Brake Package with four-piston calipers will be there for you at the end of the run, and the Low Gloss Black 20 x 9.5-inch aluminum-forged wheels with knurled bead seats minimize tire slip on the wheel and look boss while doing it.
Single Shot
And my absolute favorite option: The standard interior has just the driver’s seat only. Goodbye 114 lbs., hello lower reaction times and ETs. Okay, okay, okay, if your honey and the rugrats got to come along, front passenger and rear seats are available, individually, as $1 options.
1320. Remember that number.

2018/07/30,2019 Chevy Silverado 1500: I Like Big Beds & I Cannot Lie,"Chevy is showcasing a new metric in the ongoing truck wars: bed space. According to the automaker, the 2019 Chevy Silverado has best-in-class cargo volume, box depth, and box length at floor. Chevy also says the Silverado’s 12 fixed tie-downs and power up/down tailgate make it the most functional bed of any pickup.
“The bed is the heart and soul of any pickup, so we made several improvements to the bed of the all-new Silverado to give our customers an even better hauling experience,” explained Tim Herrick, Executive Chief Engineer, Full-Size Trucks, General Motors. “We’ve added so many features and benefits that it deserves its own name – Durabed.”
Bed Science
Although different than the average suburban four poster at the furniture mart, Chevy’s Durabed does share some of that space-age magic often touted by mattresses of the late-night shopping network variety. For example, Durabed uses higher grades of steel, and the overall quality of the bed floor materials has improved from 340 megapascals to 500 megapascals. Chevy points out the strength difference here, noting that Ram’s bed is still 340 megapascals while the F-150 is made from aluminum.
Earlier this year, one of Silverado’s lead engineers explained Chevy’s “mixed material strategy” at length with us.
The 12 aforementioned fixed tie-downs have doubled in strength: from 250 lbs. to 500 lbs. of force before bending. An additional nine moveable tie-down points are available, along with in-bed LED lighting and a 110/120-volt power outlet.
Tailgate Tech
In order to access the bed, the 2019 Chevy Silverado comes with one of four tailgates: a standard, manual gate, a lockable “Lift Assist” gate, an automatic release/power lockable gate, and the power up/down tailgate. The latter, available on the LTZ and standard on High Country, raises or lowers using the key fob, gate touchpad, or button in the cabin.
Bigger Is Better
Every Silverado bed size has increased significantly in volume for the 2019. The short-box’s volume is up to 20 percent more than any competitor’s short-box, according to Chevy. Most of that increase was achieved by widening the maximum width of the bed floor nearly ten percent (seven inches), which is implemented across all three bed sizes. Below are charts provided to us by Chevy that show their dimensions versus the competition.
The 2019 Chevy Silverado goes on sale this fall.

2018/07/30,2019 Lexus ES: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2019 Lexus ES enters its seventh generation with a number of improvements. Lexus says the ES resides in one of the industry’s most competitive segments and, as a result, the 2019 model gets a bump in luxury, performance, and fuel efficiency. An F SPORT variant is available for those who want a little extra spice.
Here is a brief walk around the 2019 Lexus ES.
Essential Foundations
The new ES rides on the Lexus Global Architecture – K (GA-K) platform, a rigid front-wheel drive chassis. The platform employs various grades of high-strength steel to reduce weight while a new multi-link rear suspension facilitates better handling. The rack-mounted electric power steering and a V-brace mounted behind the rear seat provided engineers the flexibility to further tune the 2019 ES.
Power & Performance
The 2019 Lexus ES 350 features a 3.5-liter V6 with an updated D-4S fuel injection system. The engine, which creates 302 horsepower and 267 lb-ft. of torque, is paired to a new eight-speed Direct Shift automatic. Lexus says the transmission was configured with a wider spread of ratios for an optimum combination of low-end acceleration and high-end efficiency.
EPA fuel mileage estimates are 22/33 city/highway with a combined of 26 mpg. Lexus says this is a two mile-per-gallon improvement in combined driving, despite an extra 34 horsepower and 19 lb-ft. of torque for the new model year.
The new ES 300h runs Lexus’ fourth-generation Hybrid Drive System, paired with an Atkinson cycle, 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine. With lighter, more compact designs for the electric motor and self-charging hybrid system, the new ES 300h returns an EPA rating of 43/45 city/highway and 44 combined mpg.
Total system output is 215 horsepower.
Safety & Technology
The Lexus Safety System+ 2.0 is now standard equipment, which includes daytime bicyclist detection and low light pedestrian detection. The tech treatments are numerous, from Apple CarPlay compatibility and Siri Eyes Free voice control, to Amazon Alexa functionality.
Interior Layout
Designers wanted the driver to have a more focused view of the road. For example, the layout of the center screen, instrument panel, and available heads-up display are meant to increase driver engagement. On the other hand, designers wanted to give passengers a feeling of openness, spaciousness, and comfort.
The F SPORT model includes a new metallic theme inspired by Japanese swords. The Hadori aluminum trim contains fluctuating wave patterns for a three-dimensional appearance that varies depending on the viewing angle.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Lexus ES is available now with a base price of $39,750, about a $600 increase over the outgoing model. The ES 300h starts at $41,560, about a $500 decrease compared to its predecessor.

2018/07/27,2019 Ford F-150 Limited: Rolling Out The Red Carpet,"It’s kinda like having a Raptor if the Raptor were wearing a suit and tie. That is how one might describe this latest news from truck country: the 2019 Ford F-150 Limited is getting the Raptor’s high-output EcoBoost V6. The “Limited” trim is exactly how it sounds – it’s the fanciest F-150 on the mountain, likely described as “loaded” by the dealer.
In this instance, it’s about combining the best of both words, something Ford says their customers wanted.
“They wanted more power, so we combined Raptor’s engine with Limited’s business-class features to deliver Baja fierceness, boardroom style, and the grit to tackle tough jobs,” said Todd Eckert, Ford Truck Group Marketing Manager.
Power & Performance
With the Raptor’s engine, the 2019 Ford F-150 Limited should provide plenty of grit. We recently dove the new PowerStroke diesel F-150 and thought the same thing – now we’re talking 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft. of torque, which means Ford has the most powerful truck in the segment at the moment. The high-output EcoBoost is attached to a 10-speed automatic.
An added bonus is the new dual exhaust system, which Ford says is “smoothly integrated into new rear bumper cutouts.”
Translation: we copied Ram.
Red Carpet Treatment
Premium amenities include a Miko suede headliner, leather-topped instrument panel, and Camel Back two-tone leather seats. The front seats have the “Active Motion” feature, meaning they provide extra lumbar support with a massage function for those longer trips.
“It was important for us to get this interior just right as we continue to raise the bar for premium pickup trucks,” said Aileen Barraza, Ford Color and Materials Manager. “The materials we chose to incorporate are authentic, distinctive, and durable.”
Ford’s designers didn’t leave anything to chance – they wanted the F-150 Limited to be tough, like a truck should be, but as elegant as a luxury car.
 “The gradated ash swirl trim is like something you see in a fine instrument,” Barraza continued. “Each piece is hand-finished, and a halo around the edges with a heavily polished center really brings out the natural beauty of this wood.”
Even the holes in the micro-perforated leather are enlarged to improve the cooling performance of the ventilated captain’s chairs. There’s a heated steering wheel, twin-panel moonroof, and a special laser-etched plaque on the center console armrest which displays the truck’s serial number.
“F-150 Limited customers create their own success,” Eckert explained. “The truck is their reward.”
Technology & Availability
Years ago, a tape player was considered a luxury in trucks, but the 2019 Ford F-150 Limited comes to the party with a standard B&O PLAY audio system by HARMAN. Toss in the Wi-Fi access for up to 10 devices and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility and it’s a rolling hot spot.

Optional is the Pro Trailer Backup Assist feature; drivers rotate a knob to control its direction, with the F-150 automatically steering to follow the course selected.
Expect the 2019 Ford-150 Limited in dealerships later this year.

2018/07/26,2019 Toyota 86 TRD Special Edition: All About Dat Handling,"Ah, yes: an improved Toyota 86! The 2019 Toyota 86 TRD Special Edition, the direct, linear descendant of the ToyoBaru 2012 sports car that everyone seemed to love, but everyone one said needed more power. And now? Better brakes, better dampers, better tires . . . better engine? No, but better is better, right?
Full disclosure here: I have never driven one of these. And that’s too bad. Everyone seems to like these little guys. I sort of look at them as being the Miata coupe that Mazda never made. With that Subaru flat-four, their smaller size and great handling, these things got to be an absolute terror on an AutoX course.
Could they use more power? Is that a trick question? Of course they could use more power. Everything could use more power. So, what exactly do we get?
Ride & Handling
For starters it’s all about dat handling. The 2019 Toyota 86 TRD Special Edition is North America’s highest performance version of this ride, thanks to the inclusion of SACHS dampers, whompingly huge Brembo brakes – 12.8-inchers up front and 12.4s out the back – exclusive 18 x 7.5-inch alloy wheels, and Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires (215/40R18) at all four corners.
Those SACHS dampers foster sharper steering response and enhance stability. The extra-large, four-piston front, two-piston rear Brembo brakes have enough mechanical and thermal power to haul down a freight train. Which is good since all that stopping power is affected upon the tarmac via those Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires.
And yes, those are great tires. And yes, they cost a lot. And yes, they last about as long as a crepe. But what’a’ya’gonna’do?
Exterior Treatments
The outside of every 2019 Toyota 86 TRD Special Edition is painted in Raven (i.e. black), with that TRD tricolor graphic splashed here and there. There’s also a TRD body kit and exhaust with brushed stainless steel tips. There’s the LED projector-beam headlights, color-keyed power mirrors, front fender-mounted vortex generators, and 17-inch twisted spoke alloy wheels.
Interior Layout
The inside also lets you know you’re driving in something beyond run-of-the-mill. The telescoping steering wheel is red and black-trimmed with red contrast stitching; the sport bucket seats are red and black with side bolsters, and there’s a Granlux suede-like covering on the instrument cluster. The TRD logo is embroidered on the passenger side instrument panel, and there’s red contrast stitching all over the place – even the seatbelts are red.
The 4.2-inch TFT Multi-Information Display provides essential data like G-forces, stopwatch, horsepower and torque curves, engine coolant and oil temperatures, and fuel consumption.

Engine & Transmission
All of this is propelled via the Subaru-sourced, 2.0-liter boxer four-cylinder engine fed by Toyota’s D-4S Dual Injection System. Bottom line: 205 horsepower and 156 lb-ft. of torque. That boxer-four is coupled to the 86’s standard six-speed manual transmission using a triple-cone mesh synchromesh on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears, plus the ball-bearing-mounted shift linkage and reverse gear lock-out protection.
There’s an optional, six-speed electronically-controlled automatic with “super-fast” shifts, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, a Sport Mode, and Dynamic Rev Management technology that “blips” the throttle on downshifts.
The cherry on top? A standard Torsen limited-slip differential. Oo mama!
Pricing & Availability
Production of the 2019 Toyota 86 TRD Special Edition will be limited to only 1,418 with a retail price of $32,420. Which . . .  yeah, I know, it’s not fair to compare a new car’s performance and price to the used market, but still. 33K? There’s a lot of used sports cars out there that fit that budget that are amazing.
But hey, if you want a new car, and one that’s a blast to drive, you could do much worse than a 2019 Toyota 86 TRD Special Edition.

2018/07/26,2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class: Stoned Soul Picnics & Ventura Highways,"Compact. Sporty. Trunk space. Ambient lights for days. These are the headlines should the 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class ever become a newspaper. Astute Mercedes-Benz aficionados might well remember the original 1997 A-Class, and certinately the CLA Coupe in 2013 which marked the first time in recent history a compact Mercedes-Benz was sold in the United States.
Menu items like the CLA-Class are important for Mercedes-Benz. In 2017, about one in two buyers of a Mercedes-Benz compact car in the U.S. had previously driven the competition, and more than 50 percent of CLA customers are new to the brand.
It looks like the A-Class will do something similar with its two flavors: the A 220 and A 220 4MATIC.
Power & Performance
A turbo 2.0-liter inline-four engine will propel the new A-Class around town. Toss in a healthy 188 horsepower, 221 lb-ft. of torque, and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and the daily commute should go off without a hitch.
Although they don’t go into detail, Mercedes-Benz says a “choice of suspension systems” will be available. We do know the front axle is a McPherson design with a weight-optimized, torsion-beam rear axle. The 4MATIC models have an adaptive damping system, and wheels range from 17 to 19 inches.
Structural Design
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class will come with a generous array of active safety features – in fact, it can drive semi-autonomously in certain conditions as it leverages technology from its grand daddy, the S-Class. Yet, the A-Class has passive safety designs that are equally as important, being it’s the first Mercedes-Benz developed at the Technology Centre for Vehicle Safety.
The body of the new A-Class – or its very DNA – has been subjected to extreme accident and collision testing. Thus, body shell components were developed with respect to load and stress capacity, geometry, material thickness, joining technology, and material quality; the latter meaning there is an increased proportion of high-strength and ultra-high-strength steel throughout the vehicle. The result is increased rigidity when subjected to an accident or collision.
Four Dimensional
Mercedes-Benz is keen on four specific metrics here: The car’s length is 179.1 inches; width: 70.7 inches; height: 56.9 inches, and the 107.4-inch wheelbase. The significance of these numbers is available space inside. Small car? Yes. Cramped? No. Designers were deliberate in creating this effect inside the A-Class, evidenced in little ways, from the dashboard to the “free-standing cockpit” array.
The “5th Dimension” (great music) of the A-Class is the trunk, to which Mercedes-Benz (despite touting it) does not give any exact measurements; just that is was designed with a large opening for the easy loading of big items. As an aside, a car’s trunk is always the fifth dimension. You never know what treasures have been left unattended in there.

Sixth Dimension
The lines between science fiction and compact car have blurred with the 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class. Take the new MBUX – or Mercedes-Benz User Experience system – for example. Sure, it has the main things off the bat: voice control and a touchscreen – that’s to be expected, but MBUX goes farther with Artificial Intelligence. Mercedes-Benz says the system creates an emotional connection between the vehicle, driver, and passengers.
How?
Again, Mercedes-Benz didn’t give us a lot of detail, but it seems drivers talk to the A-Class through natural speech recognition technology. For example, saying “Hey Mercedes” brings MBUX to life. MBUX is also compatible with Car-to-X Communication, or the transmission of vital information to the A-Class from other vehicles or the surrounding infrastructure in the interest of keeping occupants safe.
And finally, there are 64 colors of optional ambient lighting. Yes. 64. Pick one and throw on that old Stoned Soul Picnic record. Or the Homecoming record. Ventura Highway probably sounds pretty cool in the visual aroma of 64 different ambient lights.
Manufacturing & Availability
A-Class production will begin shortly in Aguascalientes in central Mexico with the Rastatt Plant in Germany joining in the manufacturing duties in 2019. Expect the new A-Class in the United States later this year. It seems like the A-Class would be a logical addition to the new subscription service Mercedes-Benz recently unveiled.

2018/07/25,"Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC Emerges, Dials Down On Product Development","Recently, Ford Motor Company made a substantial move in Detroit, acquiring Michigan Central Station in Corktown with the intention of making it an innovation hub for future mobility. And the automaker is already making good on that promise with the formation of Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, an organization focused on accelerating autonomous car growth.
Vast Network
Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC consists of self-driving systems integration, autonomous vehicle research and advanced engineering, autonomous transportation-as-a-service network development, user experience, and the business strategy and business development teams. These individual arms represent critical pockets of Ford’s autonomous vehicle platform, now together under one roof as they operate primarily from Detroit’s Corktown neighborhood.
“Ford has made tremendous progress across the self driving value chain – from technology development to business model innovation to user experience,” explained Jim Hackett, President and CEO, Ford Motor Company. “Now is the right time to consolidate our autonomous driving platform into one team to best position the business for the opportunities ahead.”
Investments & Leadership
The new LLC, which is structured to take on third party investment, will hold Ford’s ownership stake in Argo AI, the company’s Pittsburgh-based partner for self-driving system development. Ford expects to invest $4 billion in its autonomous vehicle efforts through 2023, including a $1 billion investment in Argo AI.
“The evolution of computing power and IT have helped bring great products to customers – from cars to tablets,” Hackett said. “We can now harness this technology to unlock a new world of vehicle personalization, supply chain choreography, and inventory leanness that rivals any industrial model in the world.”
Sherif Marakby, currently Ford’s Vice President of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification, was appointed CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC. Marakby will report to a board of directors chaired by Marcy Klevorn, Ford Executive Vice President and President, Mobility.
“The closer alignment of the self-driving platform and the mobility solutions teams will allow faster development of businesses that can thrive in the pre- and post-autonomous vehicle worlds,” reads a statement from Ford.
Flexible Solutions
Ford is also developing flexible vehicle architectures with the intention of slicing product development time – from initial sketch to customer delivery – by 20 percent. Ford’s five flexible vehicle architectures – body-on-frame, front-wheel drive unibody, rear-wheel drive unibody, commercial van unibody and BEV – are paired with module “families” that address necessary vehicle configurations.
Ford says 70 percent of each vehicle’s engineering will be derived from this new approach, with 30 percent of content – including grilles, hoods, and doors – customized uniquely for each vehicle.

Ford wants the most efficient product development process among full-line automakers within five years, noting that by 2020, their average “showroom age” will drop from 5.7 to 3.3 years. Ford goes on to say the product teams will put greater emphasis on human-centered designs and customer insights as they look to replace three-quarters of their vehicle lineup.
“We’re looking at every part of our business, making it more fit, and ensuring that every action we take is driven by what will serve our customers in a way that supports our fitness and performance goals,” Hackett said.

2018/07/24,2019 Audi A8: A Bahn-Burner of The First Order,"I’ve always had a soft spot for the big Audi sedans, the A8 and especially the S8. Sure, in the styling department they have faltered from their original taut; understated designs have turned abhorrently generic, but they will still haul you from here to there with amazing speed, grip, and comfort. Now, the 2019 Audi A8 looks to up the game even more.
Audi says their new for 2019 A8 delivers a “modern, serene interior design, usable technology, seamless connectivity and cutting-edge driver assistance features” and who am I to doubt them.
Indeed, as a top-of-the-line luxo-barge, you’d expect a big German sedan, any big German sedan to be dripping with tech. And just as expected, the A8 does not under deliver.
Power & Performance
The most important parts, the powertrain and chassis, get only a scant mention. But what we do know is how the 2019 Audi A8 will launch with its new 3.0-liter V6 TFSI turbo engine, paired with a new 48-volt electric mild-hybrid drivetrain. Audi says the V6 makes 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft. of torque.
Gearing is taken care of by an eight-speed tiptronic transmission. Naturally this is mated to a standard quattro all-wheel drive layout with a self-locking center differential. Other chassis and suspension features include adaptive air suspension, available predictive active suspension, and the available dynamic all-wheel steering system.
Interior Treatments
The interior of the 2019 Audi A8 is, of course, like a German-built UFO. The standard features include heated, 18-way power front seats with lumbar adjustments and memory, power tilt and telescopic steering column with memory, Velveeta and Nacho leather interior, er, sorry, that’s a Valetta Leather interior with Fine Nappa Extended Leather (whatever that is).
The optional air quality package includes an ionizer and aromatization; there is an optional “rear right passenger relaxation seat with heated massaging footrest,” plus aluminum-optic control buttons, and adjustable rear Matrix LED reading lights. Wait, there’s more . . . the smartphone-sized OLED touch remote can be used to customize rear seating and infotainment preferences including the Matrix reading lamps.
The front seats are now 22-way adjustable (with massage and ventilation). The steering wheel is heated, the windows are dual-pane acoustic glass, the front and rear door and center armrests are heated, while folding “productivity tables” are located in the center console.
Technology Hub
Tech and connectivity? Buckle up Buckaroo. The Audi-standard MMI touch response is here, along with two touchscreens. The upper screen is a whopping 10.3-inches and the lower one is 8.6-inches. The driver can store up to seven individual profiles and the A8 has voice interaction with natural language processing. The map and navigation system is entirely new, and the HERE-powered setup learns drive routes over time so the system can make “smarter routing suggestions.”

The new myAudi app enables a greater range of smartphone-controlled vehicle selections. Also standard is the second generation Audi virtual cockpit with a large, 12.3-inch display. There’s an available full-color heads-up display and the Audi smartphone interface works with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
The Available Bang & Olufsen Sound System comes with a Grateful Dead-level 23 speakers with Acoustic Lens Technology, 24-channel BeoCore amplifier, and a huge 1,920 watts worth of 5.1 Surround Sound. Righteous!
Safety & Security
The suite of driver assistance stuff reads like something from Mr. Spock’s office: The world’s first laser scanner in a production vehicle, improved sensors, and the zFAS central driver assistance computer that processes all of the sensor information. There is also Adaptive Cruise Assist, Intersection Assist, and Audi Pre Sense 360. More than just assisting you, if you do, ahem, get into an accident with your new Audi A8, the on-board emergency gizmos are there to help you out.
Emergency assist detects if you are unresponsive and brings the car to a stop in its lane, engages emergency hazard lights, and places an emergency SOS call.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Audi A8 with the 3.0-liter engine will go on sale this fall with a starting price of $83,800. According to Audi, a V8 engine will be available next summer. I can only surmise that, given the scant mentions of the drivetrain, it can only (hopefully) mean the upcoming S8 will be a real luxo-Bahn-burner of the first order.

2018/07/23,2018 Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2018 Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid gets a mild refresh for the middle of the year and a slight, I mean very slight, price bump. That said, for your money, between $33,250 and $38,850, depending on model, you get a giant basket of standard stuff.
The main story here is that styling for the hybrid now matches that of the already released Sonata gasoline models. The Korean auto giant says you can travel for 28 miles using all-electric drive, even though the starting price for the 2018 Sonata Plug-In Hybrid has dropped $1,350 from the 2017 model.
The Sonata Plug-in Hybrid Limited, however, gets a price bump by $250, but now comes with a bunch of new features.
Safety Tech
Seriously, the list is crazy complete, with Automatic Emergency Braking with pedestrian detection, LED Headlights with Dynamic Bending Lights, Lane Keep Assist, and Driver Attention Alert.
The Forward Collision Warning is now enhanced with an Automatic Emergency Braking function, and the Lane Departure Warning now adds a Lane Keep Assist function. There’s an additional USB charge port and a wireless charging pad for mobile devices. The steering wheel is heated and the Bi-function LED headlights with dynamic bending lights are there for the ride in 2018.
Power & Performance
And like I mentioned, the all-electric range is up to 28 miles, an improvement of one mile. While Hyundai’s Plug-In Hybrid tech gets you a 99 EPA-estimated MPGe rating, the hybrid efficiency nets you 39 mpg. Add everything up and you get a total driving range of an impressive 600 miles.
The old school portion of the drivetrain ain’t that old school. It’s a 2.0-liter GDI four-cylinder Atkinson Cycle engine, which is nifty. The electric motor portion cranks out 50 kW (that’s 67 horsepower, which is a better way to put it) and that’s hooked up to a six-speed automatic transmission versus the now chic CVT. The 50 kW electric motor is 32 percent more powerful and allows for more efficient EV operation during higher engine loads and speeds.
The battery pack is a state-of-the-art 9.8 kWh lithium-ion polymer deal that’s more than five times larger than the Sonata Hybrid’s battery, and can be charged using a 240V Level 2 charging station in slightly less than three hours.
Styling & Design
The exterior now includes a more dynamic front fascia with new sheet metal on the hood and front fenders. The design refresh, naturally, incorporates the new Hyundai signature cascading grille shape, and the new rear deck lid allows for a sleeker, coupe-like appearance they say. The 17-inch eco-spoke alloy wheels have been redesigned; there’s distinctive blue bezel headlights and taillights with a clear outer lens to further highlight the refreshed styling.

Naturally, the Sonata Plug-In Hybrid’s interior has also been updated with a revised center stack area and instrument cluster, while the steering wheel now has a sportier leather-wrapped three-spoke design.
Like I said, that’s a lot for less than 40-large, y’know?

2018/07/21,Fiat Introduces New Chrome Packages But The Shine Is Lacking,"Chrome isn’t just for big trucks, now little Fiats are in on the action with a new appearance package for the 500L and 500X. Add this to Fiat’s recent package blitz which includes the Urbana, Blue Sky, and Adventurer editions. And while these appearance packages have their allure, it’s like a sparkler or sugar snake when what’s really needed is a blazing bottle rocket.
The Fiat lineup could use an extensive redesign. Something. Anything. These upgraded packages are great, but only go so far as the brand struggles to maintain traction.
Tiny Tanks
People either love or loathe Fiat; their cars are either amazing or asinine. Their Italian styling is rather unconventional considering what Americans are normally accustomed to. Traditionally, we are a culture of big trucks and stylish SUVs, a stark contrast to the tiny cruisers of the Fiat farm. Although, like a lot of products sold across this great country, the Fiat brand is personality-driven and those who have them closely identify with them.
While it’s a story for another time, I came into Fiat ownership by sheer happenstance. I likely would have bought another Ford because that’s what I drove for years, but my 2016 500X changed the way I see the Fiat.
My 500X is a tiny tank. Literally. Michigan roads, especially around metro Detroit, are rough. A vehicle’s suspension and chassis will take a licking here, and that’s not including winter. The 500X, in its current form, rides on a Jeep platform, a huge advantage in terms of durability. Mine is front-wheel drive, although all-wheel drive is available. I get about 7,500 miles between oil changes and with the nine-speed automatic (which shifts seamlessly), I average upwards of 38 to 40 mpg on the highway.
Although most of what you read on Fiat is exactly the opposite. Just scan the latest rankings from Consumer Reports.
Shot In The Dark
What is Fiat to do? Truthfully, I don’t have the answer. If I did, I would likely be an executive there making the big bucks, but I would suggest we stop scratching for sardines and fry bigger fish. It’s time for an overhaul. Something. Anything. It wouldn’t hurt to “Americanize” the lineup a bit – not saying to abandon the Italian flare entirely – but finding a way to marry the styling cues of both cultures might help, especially for the 500X.
If I’m Fiat, I’m working overtime to make meaningful connections with the younger buyers who want small SUVs.
The 124 Spider and 500 Abarth are cool and they can stay. The 500L cannot. It’s hideous. Yet, according to Fiat, U.S. sales are up more than 20 percent year-over-year through June, making the 500L Fiat’s fastest growing nameplate. Sure. Fine. But the 500L is the one ugly duckling that’s not growing up to be a beautiful swan.

How about a nice, sporty mid-size sedan? Honda, Toyota, and Nissan are profitable with cars like this, why not Fiat? Slap an Abarth badge on there with some horsepower, braking and suspension upgrades, and suddenly the Fusion Sport and Regal GS have company. How about the Audi S4 or BMW 340i? Why not? Kia is taking on the Germans with the Stinger, why not a muscled-up Fiat too?
Happy Accident
I don’t have the whole picture as to what is going on at Fiat, but for better or worse, it seems like a lot. I won’t speak for them and I am sure they know what they are doing, but a complete redesign of key vehicles, like the 500X and 500L (shudder), would help immensely.
I don’t see people waiting on pins and needles going “Oh, I just cannot wait to see the Chrome Appearance Group on the new Fiats.” If somebody gets one of these new chromed Fiats it will likely be by accident. They went in looking at a 500X, liked the one on the showfloor, and it just so happened to have this chrome package.
Just in case you are chomping at the bit for one, the equipment list is below. I’ll be over here, holding my breath for the Fiat Abarth performance sedan.

2018/07/21,Hyundai And Amazon Launch Digital Showroom,"Virtual Reality is here!!! Virtual Reality will be the technology of 1988 1992 1995 2001 2015 2018!! I know, I know. We’ve been hearing this same tired song for decades, but now, if Hyundai and Amazon are to be believed, Virtual Reality might actually be a viable thing.
Houses & Cars
I’ve been involved with more than a few VR companies over the years. Yeah, it’s very intriguing and the experience can be cool but, for what ever reason, it’s never caught on the way they tell us it should. Strangely enough, one of the areas where VR actually does seem to be working is in real estate. I’ve known a couple of guys that make VR environments for yet-to-be-built condos.
Want to see what your million dollar, 20th floor condo looks like? Want to check out the views? Put on this headset. Want to see what the view on floor 28 looks like compared to floor 20? Click, there ya go.
Whether someone from the real estate industry tipped Hyundai off, or whether they just came up with it on their own, Hyundai has something similar for the automotive world.
Virtual Showroom
Hyundai’s new digital showroom, that they cooked up with Amazon (that hosts all the data and acts as the gateway), offers car buyers the ability to not only compare pricing and reviews, but also book test drives, and check on dealer inventories. Hyundai says this is all part of their commitment to exceptional customer service, and it’s hard not to see that they’re right.
The “showroom” Hyundai set up on Amazon takes you, the prospective car buyer, on a “customer journey,” which sounds like some Grade A marketing gobbledygook. You start with the “brand experience” page that highlights the latest in Hyundai’s technology and automotive innovation. Next, if you want to be really linear about this, you can learn about Hyundai Assurance (that highlights the Korean company’s Connected Care, warranty services, 24/7 Roadside Assistance, and Hyundai Care).
You can then see more details on various Hyundais based on your preferences and buying habits. You can also read reviews, check pricing, set up test drives (in the real world), streamline your purchase options, and even find a local Hyundai dealer.
Upward Expansion
Interestingly, this is not the first time Hyundai and Amazon have worked together. They first collaborated in 2016 with “Prime Now, Drive Now,” an on-demand program that allowed buyers to book test drives through Amazon Prime Now. On top of this, Hyundai was the first mainstream automaker to connect cars with homes using Amazon Echo and the Blue Link skill for Amazon Alexa. So look for this Hyundai and Amazon partnership to continue.

2018/07/20,VinFast: The Future of Vietnam’s Automotive Industry?,"There’s a new startup car company – VinFast – looking to revolutionize the world of personal transportation. These days, that’s not very surprising to read. What is surprising is how this new car company is Vietnamese, and will be producing a home-grown sedan and SUV.
These first two rides will be produced at a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in northern Vietnam.
Literary Perspective
In 1992, Neal Stephenson wrote this book called Snow Crash. It’s a pretty interesting book, and there’s a passage in it I was reminded of when this press release wafted across my digital transom:
“When it gets down to it — talking trade balances here — once we’ve brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once things have evened out, they’re making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in Tadzhikistan and selling them here — once our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel — once the Invisible Hand has taken away all those historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity — y’know what? There’s only four things we do better than anyone else: . . . “
Or, to put it in more modern terms: “You think Detroit’s got problems now? Wait until they start banging out the 2028 Camaro in Ho Chi Minh City.”
The question is not can they, but when will they. And, if now is the time it all starts, are VinFast the people to do it? We will find out relatively soon, because we’ll be able to see both an SUV and sedan at the Paris Motor Show this coming October. Oh, and they don’t seem to be doing things by half, since both rides are being developed by Pininfarina.
Blazing Speed
VinFast says their cars are developed to “international standards,” meaning they want to compete with the available offerings in Munich and Los Angeles and London. That’s biting off a lot, first time around. And to make this even more interesting, VinFast crowd-sourced the designs, with the Vietnamese people voting on their favorites from a range of options presented in October 2017.
Yes, VinFast is going from design kick off to debut in one year. And these first two models will be for sale in Vietnam by September 2019. All the while Vinfast says their upcoming twins will “meet international standards and customer expectations in terms of design, quality, dynamics, premium in-car features, and the ownership experience.”

A Few Questions
It’s at this point where things turn rather run-of-the-mill concerning the finer points of VinFast. They will be working with “world-leading” European design, engineering, and production technology partners, but they don’t tell you who those partners are, apart from Pininfarina. In the boardroom, VinFast has also recruited senior executives from some of the industry’s “leading automotive companies,” but they don’t mention who those senior executives are, or from which automotive companies they were recruited.
So far, it looks as if VinFast has recruited only from General Motors.
Real Deal
VinFast is not all vapor and marketing smoke. They are nearly finished with construction of their purpose-built, state-of-the-art 335-hectare plant in Hai Phong, making it one of Vietnam’s biggest industrial projects ever. And yeah, that’s the same Hai Phong that Dick Nixon decided to mine and bomb in 1972.
Also, it’s worth noting that VinFast’s corporate owners, Vingroup, is one of Vietnam’s largest, privately-held businesses, with annual revenues in 2017 of 3.8 billion USD. Which is good, because designing and building cars from scratch takes a lot of money.

2018/07/19,BMW Marries Car & Ride Sharing In Seattle,"The tech explosion of the past 20 years has shown us, more than anything else, that if you combine greed with imitation, you get competitors. Now that Uber (McDonalds) and Lyft (Burger King) came up with the idea of “ride sharing,” along comes BMW with its entry into the game, ReachNow (Wendy’s). The burger joint analogy is on purpose. Anybody can run a good mom & pop burger joint, but going national and franchising your operation?
That’s a little more tricky.
Two In One
ReachNow is the mobility services division of BMW Group, maker of all things fast, boxy, and Bavarian. ReachNow says they are famous for being “the first company to operate both car sharing and ride hailing within a single app.” Sure, but I’ve never heard of it. This app, what ReachNow refers to as a “suite of mobility solutions,” can do essentially more than one thing, transportation-wise.
ReachNow was first rolled out as a multimodal (i.e. more than one kind of transportation) strategy at Automobility LA in November 2016, and now they are putting it out in the real world to see how it works. Or, at least they’re putting it out in Seattle, which may or may not count as “real.”
What sets ReachNow apart from say, Lyft or Zipcar, is that ReachNow combines all of those services into one, big service. With this, you can get a short term vehicle, like a Zipcar sort of deal, or you can just get a ride from point A to B, like with a Lyft. ReachNow allows you to personalized your level of comfort, and also customize your individual plan based on convenience or cost.
Let’s break this down . . .
Piece By Piece
“Drive or ride” means customers (ReachNow calls them members) can choose between driving themselves via car sharing or getting a ride from the ride hailing service. Slick. If you choose to drive yourself, you can select from a fleet of hundreds of BMW and MINI vehicles, which sounds like fun. You pay by the minute, by the hour or by the day, meaning that ReachNow offers all the non-car-ownership options: ride, drive for a bit, or rent for a while.
The “go now or go later” option allows you the choice between an immediate, on-demand pick up or planning ahead and scheduling a pick up. You can reserve your transportation needs from 20 minutes to up to seven days in advance, which should come in handy for doing things like getting rides to the airport and such.

With the “personalized comfort” part of the app, you can individualize the in-vehicle experience by setting your temperature and music preferences beforehand. You can also select a “quiet time” feature if you wish to not be disturbed during the trip. You know, this way you keep your interactions with another living, breathing, feeling human down to the absolute minimum.
Another nifty feature is, once you reserve a ReachNow car, the destination will be sent automatically to the in-vehicle navigation. Nice.
Pricing & Availability
ReachNow users in Seattle will be the first to get the full experience, with the sign up fee waived for new members who want to try the Ride portion only. The standard ReachNow Ride pricing starts at a $3.24 minimum, with a $2.40/mile plus $0.40/minute premium (no surge pricing).
The app works on both iPhone and Android devices.
Local Perspective
On a final note, let me add this: As a longtime Seattleite, this can’t make things any worse. I hope. Traveling around Seattle is a never-ending Boschian nightmare. 95 percent of the drivers are lack-whit sub-morons, the traffic planning is designed by sadists (I think), and the level of road maintenance makes you think you’re driving in Mogadishu, not Queen Anne.
None of this would matter if Seattle had a workable public transportation system, but it doesn’t. So if BMW’s scheme works, more the better. It’ll get you knuckle-dragging gibbons off the roads. I hope.

2018/07/19,2019 Acura MDX: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2019 Acura MDX offers up lots of what current SUV buyers are looking for: room, infotainment gear, safety gadgets, and enough on and (semi) off-road capabilities for 90 percent of the situations modern drivers should hope to find themselves in.
Special Treatments & New Colors
After the major design refresh in 2017 and key tech upgrades in 2018, the 2019 Acura MDX comes with new interior improvements to up the luxury. There’s such niceties as Desert Olive Ash wood trim, high-contrast seat and door panel stitching, and contrasting front seat side garnishes. The Technology and Entertainment packages get an updated second-row seat configuration and the Advance Package adds a trim-exclusive matching wood center console trim.
2019 will also see new colors on the MDX, bringing the total to nine available shades. The new colors include Gunmetal Metallic, Majestic Black Pearl, Performance Red Pearl, Canyon Bronze Metallic, and the A-Spec-exclusive Apex Blue Pearl.
There are also newly-designed 20-inch aluminum alloy wheels on offer with a machine finish and Shark Grey accents. These new rims are also a half-inch wider than before and are wrapped in wider, 265/45-series tires.
Safety & Security
Of course the 2019 MDX has enough standard safety and driver-assistive tech to make you feel like an astronaut.  All 2019 MDXs come standard with the AcuraWatch suite of safety gear. This means stuff like Collision Mitigation Braking with Forward Collision Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, and Road Departure Mitigation with Lane Departure Warning.
On top of all this active stuff, all MDX’s boast an array of passive safety features, such as Acura’s Advance Compatibility Engineering body structure, front and side-curtain airbags, front pre-tensioning seatbelts, four-channel anti-lock brakes with Electronic Brake Distribution, Vehicle Stability Assist with traction control; even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System.
A-Spec Action
Now, about that A-Spec trim. To my mind, Acura A-Spec stuff is like a “halfway to an R-Type” sort of deal. Not full on performance, but a bit of a bump regardless. In the case of the 2019 MDX, you get the torque-vectoring/Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system and a more athletic stance highlighted by those 20-inch Shark Grey aluminum wheels.
There’s a new front fascia, body-color lower sills, larger-diameter exhaust finishers, and gloss-black/dark chrome trim for the headlights, grille, window surround, and rear tailgate spoiler. On the inside, you’ll find sport seats trimmed in rich red or black leather with black Alcantara inserts and contrast stitching, plus unique A-Spec gauges, sport pedals, Alcantara door inserts, and a thicker-rimmed A-Spec-badged steering wheel.

Power & Performance
The 2019 MDX is powered by a 3.5-liter, direct-injected i-VTEC 24-valve V6 engine that puts out 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft. of torque. The SH-AWD system delivers up to 70 percent of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels (yay!) and has the ability to split torque between the left and right rear wheels to increase traction and handling.
The latest MDX comes with a nine-speed automatic transmission with the upgraded Idle Stop feature now standard across the lineup. A nifty chart showing all the options, prices, and fuel economy is below.

2018/07/18,Coast To Coast: New Interactive Map Shows How America’s Interstates Evolved,"Like many, I enjoy a good road trip. Twice a year, I make the 900 some mile trek from Michigan to South Dakota to see family – once in the summer and once in the winter for Christmas. It’s 14 hours of pavement and music from my personal CD collection which includes everything from country to indie rock. I take a long stretch on I-90 through Wisconsin and Minnesota, which offers some nice views of America’s heartland.
I-90, end to end, is about 3,000 miles, or around six percent of the nearly 50,000 miles of Intestate Highways that span the United States.
Sea To Shining Sea
Just how America’s Interstate Highway System evolved is the subject of a new interactive map from Geotab. The built-in timeline shows how the network expanded over the years, giving us insight into how the infrastructure developed to support today’s travel and transportation requirements.
“As America’s Interstate Highway System approaches a major milestone, we wanted to pay tribute to this intricate and expansive network,” explained Maria Sotra, Vice President of Marketing, Geotab.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law in June of that year, the largest public infrastructure act of its kind at the time. Geotab’s map highlights the system’s major developments, like the 1974 completion of I-5 that connects Mexico and Canada, and the opening of I-80, the nation’s first coast-to-coast highway.
“Connecting people, enabling business, and providing a straightforward path across one of the largest countries in the world, the nearly 50,000 miles of highway that makes up the Interstate Highway System has played an undeniable role in transportation and trade in the United States,” Sotra said.
Of The Highest Order
In 1954, during a road safety conference, President Eisenhower recalled when he first heard that automobile fatalities had, at the time, surpassed those of every war the United States was involved in. This was no doubt, for the once Supreme Allied Commander Europe, alarming news.
“It is a problem for all of us, from the highest echelon of government to the lowest echelon and a problem for every citizen, no matter what his station or his duty,” President Eisenhower said during the conference. “We have great organizations working effectively and supported by the government, to seek ways and means of promoting peace in the world in order that these great tragedies may be prevented or at least minimized in the future.”
In 1954, President Eisenhower was looking ahead to 1975, when it was believed there would be some 80 million automobiles on U.S. roads. The President said the government was committed to building more highways to accommodate the increasing number of vehicles.

“They mean progress for our country. They mean greater convenience for greater numbers of people, greater happiness, and greater standards of living,” the President said of automobiles. “But we have got to learn to control the things that we must use ourselves, and not let them be a threat to our lives and to our loved ones.”
Today, the Interstate Highway System accounts for 25 percent of all highway traffic in the country.
Wide Open Spaces
Earlier this year, Geotab complied a list of the most scenic routes in America, which nicely accommodates this new interactive map on U.S. Interstates. As time permits, jump in your car and take a random road trip – you never know what unexpected treasures you will find along the way. And during the journey, you can impress your friends and family with how much you know about the Interstate Highway System.

2018/07/17,"The Bugatti Divo: We’re Not In Akron, Ohio Anymore","Bugatti has decided that what the world needs is a hot rod version of its Chiron hypercar. It’s called the Divo and is, essentially, everything a “normal” Chiron is, only more so. To which I say, who cares?
Look, all modern Bugattis are amazing cars. The Veyron, Chiron, and now the Divo are technical marvels of the first automotive order. They all produce fantastic amounts of energy and apply it to the tarmac with amazing efficiency. They are the car to have if you’re a prince from a nation swimming in oil or the heir to some serious olde money or a quarter-talented marketing exercise for a record label.
The maintenance schedule is slightly worse than a Soyuz and only 3.46 times more expensive.
Heavy Handed
Let me put it this way: When was the last time you saw a modern Bugatti at a track? That’s right, you don’t. For all of their gee-whiz record holding and bedroom poster potential, for me, the latest Bugattis are kind of lackluster.
The reconstituted Bugatti is a division of Volkswagen and they are designed, built, and maintained by Germans. That alone is enough to make Ettore turn over in his grave, but the fact they don’t race is probably enough to make the old man flop over face down in his coffin so Der Deutsch could kindly embrasse son cul.
And so now we have the Divo, which is said to be lighter, generate more downforce, and pull higher Gs than the Chiron it’s based on. That is all very well and good, because, first off, let’s face facts: All new Bugattis are pigs. They are way heavier than they should be, the Chiron tipping the scales at an SUV-challenging 4,400 lbs. No wonder they crank out so much power, eh?
Whip It Good
The Bugatti Divo is named after Albert Divo, the French race car driver from the 20s. He’s best known for winning the famous Targa Florio in Sicily, twice. That is no small accomplishment, but he was driving Bugattis, Type 35Cs no less, both times, so that was a help. Oh, and just so you know, the Bugatti Divo is pronounced deeVO, not DEEvo.
Devo are those guys from Akron, Ohio. There’s no connection between the two. At least that I know of.
Bugatti says since they are naming this car after the guy that won that race, and since the Targa is like a 30 mile long AutoX course lined with rock walls, precipitous drop-offs, and crazed Sicilians (is that redundant?) the Divo will be “light and nimble and will boast enormous downforce and g-forces.” Huzzah! But since they give no specs, “light” is going to be a subjective term here. Sort of like saying Jackie Stewart is “taller” than Peter Dinklage.
RELATED
GM to Make Face Masks for Frontline Workers
“Happiness is not around the corner. It is the corner,” said Stephan Winkelmann, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. and I, for one, am not going to argue with that. Winkelmann continues, “With this project, the Bugatti team has an opportunity to interpret the brand DNA in terms of agile, nimble handling in a significantly more performance-oriented way.”
Sure . . . agile, nimble handling. I bet Lotus is laughing pretty hard right now.
Limited Edition
The Bugatti Divo will be made in a limited run of only 40 vehicles, which for Bugatti, doesn’t sound all that limited. The net price is €5 million, or around 6 million dollars. And no, I have no idea what “net” price is. Does that mean that’s what it’ll run you out the door? With taxes and titles and dealer prep included? Whatever.
The Bugatti Divo will be unveiled at 11:20 a.m. Pacific (a curiously specific time) on August 24th 2018 on the lawn at The Quail – A Motorsports Gathering in California, part of the Monterey Historics. If it were me, I’d blow this off and spend more time over at Laguna Seca watching the real cars race.

2018/07/14,2019 Dodge Durango: Adulting Just Got Cool,"It’s a predicament. You love horsepower but the stork has visited your residence on a few occasions. Maybe that old sports or performance car got traded in somewhere along the way for a minivan or run-of-the-mill SUV? Whatever the case, you have a family you need to haul around town now.
Responsibilities. Priorities.
Adulting.
The 2019 Dodge Durango is uniquely suited for family, adult-going types who still want a little extra performance and style. Across the range, the Durango offers several different powertrain options, including all-wheel drive, plus a number of connectivity and infotainment features.
Here is a look at the Durango lineup for 2019.
Durango SRT
Over breakfast, the kids are uttering new catchphrases they discovered on the latest social media app. They are Draking about having to go to school and are acting quite Salty, but little do they know the drive there is about to be Lit. Why? Because Hemi.
The Durango SRT with its 392 (cubic-inch) V8 creates 475 horsepower and 470 lb-ft. of torque, good enough to launch this beast to 60 in 4.4 seconds. The SRT Durango also runs a quarter-mile in 12.9 seconds as certified by the National Hot Rod Association. That’s what we call Real Talk, and if that isn’t enough to make the kids these day exclaim “Zayum,” then the donuts you do in the school parking lot (don’t actually do that) should suffice.
The Durango SRT’s Brembo braking system comes complete with two-piece, vented rotors and six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers. The all-wheel drive is paired to an Active Damping System while the custom exhaust lets the world know you are just around the corner.
Leather and carbon fiber treatments decorate the inside, plus heated and cooled seats. The available 825-watt, 19-speaker Harman Kardon stereo is a nice touch, even if people don’t care for your taste in music.
Durango R/T
When you need more but not too much, the 2019 Dodge Durango R/T is the ticket with its evergreen 5.7-liter Hemi V8 and TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic. The R/T provides a healthy 360 horsepower, 390 lb-ft. of torque, and a tow rating of 7,400 lbs. The Hemi’s “Fuel Saver Technology” feature utilizes cylinder deactivation, alternating the engine between four and eight cylinders.
Sepia leather seats and the aforementioned Harman Kardon audio system are available.
Standard equipment is plentiful: performance steering and suspension systems, LED fog lamps, high-intensity discharge headlamps, navigation, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.
Durango Citadel
The word Citadel may elicit images of castles, colleges, and financial markets but the Durango has its own interpretation of the 16th century word. With refinements straight out of the 21st century, the Durango Citadel is an infotainment stronghold with navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto.

The aforementioned Harman Kardon audio system is also an option.
Behind the Citadel’s gate is either a standard 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 with 295 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque, or the optional 5.7-liter Hemi with 360 horsepower and 390 lb-ft. of torque. The Pentastar can tow 6,200 lbs. while the Citadel with the Hemi can match the R/T’s tow rating of 7,400 lbs.
Durango GT
The 2019 Dodge Durango GT holds the middle ground in the Durango lineup and is the perfect balance of “everything you need, nothing you don’t.” The nicely-equipped GT seats seven with leather-trimmed bucket seats and heated first and second-row seats as an option. For those grocery runs, the power liftgate option is worth its weight in gold.
Standard features on the GT include LED daytime running lamps and dual exhaust.
The Pentastar V6 and TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic provide the GT with a 6,200 lbs. towing capacity. Both rear and all-wheel drive powertrains are available. An SRT-inspired hood with a center air inlet duct and two heat extractors is available – you know, for something a little extra.
Durango SXT
Simple but far from plain, the 2019 Dodge Durango SXT gets the job done with its Pentastar V6 and five-passenger seating that can be configured 50 different ways. The SXT receives a seven-inch, full-color infotainment digital display, plus Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Bluetooth compatibility.
The Voice Command system is also standard along with a push-button start.
Colors & Additional Options
The 2019 Dodge Durango is available in 11 colors: Octane Red, Redline Red, In-Violet, Granite, Billet, DB Black, White Knuckle, and Vice White. New colors (late availability) include Reactor Blue, Destroyer Gray, and F8 Green.
All Durango models now offer an integrated trailer brake when equipped with the Trailer Tow Package. Blind-spot Monitoring with Rear Cross Path detection is available as a free-standing option.
Availability
Expect the 2019 Dodge Durango in the showroom this fall, although orders can be placed at dealers now.

2018/07/14,Automobili Pininfarina: A New Breed of Luxury Electric Cars?,"A while back, Pininfarina, the famous Italian design firm, was bought by Mahindra, the Indian car/truck/tractor manufacturer. And yes, honestly, that was kind of troubling on the face of it. But now, the “new” Pininfarina is getting into the luxury car business is a very odd way:
They’re going to take on Tesla.
Waxing Poetics
Pininfarina really needs no introduction. They were, for all intents and purposes, Ferrari’s non-in-house-in-house designers for decades. They have a history of designing some of the most beautiful cars the world has ever seen. They also, for a brief period of time, “manufactured” their own cars. Okay, what they really did was re-badge Fiats with Pininfarina badges and sell them under their name when Fiat was tanking for the final time in North America in the late 70s and early 80s.
But now, carrying on in that vein under their new corporate owners, Pininfarina looks to be “the world’s newest car brand, with a plan to sustainably develop and produce fully-electric, ultra-luxury cars at the pinnacle of design and desirability in their respective segments.”
What?
Cutting Through The Clutter
This simultaneously makes lots of sense and is utterly confusing. A new ultra-luxury car brand? Sustainably develop and produce cars? Cars at the pinnacle of design and desirability? Sure, makes complete sense. Develop and produce fully-electric cars? Again: What? Sure, that makes a certain kind of sense: EVs are on their way; we’re going to need more of them and less ICE powered cars yadda-yadda-yadda; go high-end because the rich can afford this.
All of that makes sense, but this is Pininfarina. The same guys that made such hairy-chested rides as the Ferrari 275 and the F40? The same guys that designed cars as beautiful and sublime as the Ferrari GT Lusso?
Okay then.
And they’re not starting on the bottom rungs of the ladder here, oh no. Automobili Pininfarina (that’s the car manufacturing people now owned by Mahindra) will be working closely with Pininfarina SpA (that’s the legendary Italian automotive styling house not owned by Mahindra) on a car code named PF0 that will be an ultra-low volume, ultra-luxurious fully-electric hypercar.
Think something that looks like a La Ferrari powered by batteries that will blow any and all Teslas into the Adriatic.
Global Presence
And from here, it gets even more interesting. Automobili Pininfarina will continue its ongoing technical collaboration with the Mahindra Racing Formula E team. Racing improves the bread, after all.
The long-term plan is for the new Automobili Pininfarina to deliver a range of vehicles across the globe, although North America will likely be the largest market. The company says they will present the first customer with their car in less than two years and that it will come with “unmatched performance and unprecedented heritage.”
RELATED
Porsche 911 Turbo S: Most Powerful 911 Turbo Yet
The PF0 will run you between two and $2.5 million, and once that sets the world ablaze, it will be followed by a series of low-volume, all-electric vehicles including luxury SUVs. And they say all of this will be “sold and serviced through a network of experienced luxury car retailers,” but give absolutely zero details on what that network of experienced luxury car retailers will be.
Talented Team
The other interesting item in all this marketing hype is that Pininfarina has Paolo Dellacha sitting on the company’s board as Product and Platform Director. In singing Paolo’s praises, they note that he spent nearly two decades in computer-aided engineering, testing, and engineering and design roles at Ferrari, Maserati, and Alfa Romeo. And that he is a published author of automotive technical papers and was part of the team that secured drivetrain and chassis patents for Ferrari.
If my memory serves, I think Paolo Dellacha was the guy that came up with the Magna-ride variable shock-absorber for Ferrari that they then sold (and leased back) to Chevy. If that’s the case, Dellacha could do some very interesting stuff, given the opportunity – think tying in a fully active suspension with an all-electric drivetrain to dramatically increase performance.
Sounds like this could be fun. And given it’s coming from Pininfarina, it will probably look gorgeous.

2018/07/12,Starting MSRP Announced For 2019 Chevy Silverado Chassis Cab Trucks,"Chevrolet has announced the starting price of the 2019 Silverado chassis cab trucks, set for production later this year. The new chassis cab trucks will begin at $48,465, which includes a $1,495 destination charge. The trucks are designed for a number of uses and industries, including construction, plumbing, landscaping, and agriculture.
The trucks can also be custom equipped for government entities, local utilities, and first responders.
Engine & Transmission
The new Sliverados will come with a Duramax diesel (6.6-liter) with 350 horsepower and 700 lb-ft. of torque. The engine is paired to an Allison transmission with a Power Take Off (PTO) option.
“These new Silverado chassis cabs are a great addition to our lineup because we can now offer small businesses and large fleets a truck that can be upfitted to do many jobs,” said Ed Peper, U.S. Vice President, GM Fleet.
Performance & Capacity
The Chevrolet Silverado 6500HD, despite being similar in size to the 4500HD and 5500HD, comes with a GVWR rating of 22,900 lbs.
“Bucket truck builders, fleet managers, and many other customers told us they face a dilemma when their GVWR needs exceed 19,500 lbs.,” explained John Schwegman, Director of Commercial Product and Medium Duty, GM Fleet.
Schwegman says some opt for more expensive aluminum bodies to save weight but still stay within a Class 5 chassis. Others may spend additional money for a larger truck, giving them more GVWR than necessary.
“The Silverado 6500HD gives them capability and protects their bottom line,” he said. “It’s a great solution.”
Upfitting & Servicing
The truck’s frame is designed with one-piece straight rails with no rivets or brackets on top that would otherwise interfere with the mounting of custom-made bodies. Chevrolet says this design helps save time and money during the upfitting process.
Engineers also spent a great deal of time making sure the new chassis cab trucks were easier to service. For example, the new Silverados have a clamshell hood and a wheel cut of up to 50 degrees to give technicians better engine access.
Dual fuel tanks with a 65 gallon capacity, a factory-installed air suspension, and a full suite of connectivity features like built-in 4G LTE WiFi are available.

2018/07/11,"Honda Hits Doubleheader With 2019 Pilot, HR-V Updates","Honda has put a doubleheader in play here, with updates for 2019 coming for both the Pilot and the HR-V utes. Yes, I said “utes.” Anyway, the broad brushstrokes are the Pilot gets a more aggressive styling redo, the HR-V gets two new trims levels, and now all Hondas will get the Honda Sensing package of safety tech.
So let’s dive right in with the 2019 Honda Pilot.
Transmission & Entertainment
For those new to this sphere, the Pilot is Honda’s big SUV (or as big as they’re currently making). While still keeping the seating capacity at a healthy eight people, the 2019 Pilot brings quite the list of upgrades to the Pilot. The first thing you’ll notice is the more aggressive exterior styling, but this is not just a mid-cycle styling refresh, oh no.
Also to be found on the 2019 Pilot is a new, hands-free power tailgate and significant refinements to the beast’s nine-speed automatic (but that trick transmission is found only in the Touring and Elite trims).
4G LTE in-car Wi-Fi is now along for the ride and so is the larger rear entertainment system with Blu-Ray and streaming video capability. Given that 99.9 percent of the rides with the Honda Pilot will be family trips, having in-car net access and a rear entertainment system will probably be heaven sent to you over-worked, under-slept parents.
Pilot Chat
You parents of the less-than-saintly disposition will be happy to know that Honda’s innovative CabinTalk in-car PA system is also standard. My tendency would be to use it for saying “Uh, this is your captain speaking. We’re at our cruising altitude of, uh, four feet, and we will be arriving at our destination – uncle Merle and Aunt Vernie’s – at about 4:30.”
Or . . .
“ALRIGHT JUNIOR!! IF I HAVE TO GET ON THE HORN ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR ON YOUR MOTHER’S GRAVE I WILL PULL THIS HUGE HONDA PILOT OVER YOUNG MAN!!! DO NOT TEST ME MISTER!!!!!”
Connectivity & Safety
It seems all the “infotainment” stuff can be controlled via a smartphone-enabled CabinControl app. You can also adjust things with a new Display Audio touchscreen system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto built right in. And the system is slick enough to behave like your smartphone and get over-the-air updates, which sounds pretty cool.
Yes, the 2019 Pilot will come with the Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive gizmos as standard on all grades. Nice. In other words, Honda is really serious about it. They plan to make it standard equipment on all models and trims within the next four years

2018/07/09,"Nissan Titan Surfcamp Flexes Beach Bod, Towel Snaps Competition","Nissan is showing off their six pack this summer and towel-snapping the competition with the new Titan Surfcamp. The super truck is ideal for beach goers and surfing enthusiasts: Nitto off-road tires? Check. Rooftop tent? Yep. Fishing rods? Bet your bottom dollar. Solar-powered shower? Better Believe It!
Inquires from everyone on the beach when pulling up? Indeed. Get ready to field a few questions.
Sun & Sand
The Surfcamp is the latest in Nissan’s Titan Adventure series, an array of lifestyle-themed project builds. It started with the Titan Project Basecamp for the camping lifestyle, then the skiing-themed Armada Snow Patrol, and the family adventure-themed Armada Mountain Patrol. The BBQ crowd even got their coals stoked with the Smokin’ Titan, a flagship truck for those carnivorous cookouts where bringing a salad won’t make you any friends.
“In the summer, beach parking lots are full of trucks hauling surfboards, fishing rods, boats, and campers as people crave the sun and sand,” explained Fred DePerez, Vice President, Nissan North America LCV Business Unit. “Inspired by the vintage beach trucks of the 1960s, Titan Surfcamp is a celebration of the beach truck tradition with all the modern technologies Titan customers want when they head out to surf, shore fish, and camp-out by the water.”
Essential Equipment
The Nissan Titan Surfcamp comes with a surfboard, stand-up paddleboard rack, and a Rhino-Rack Batwing awning for extra shade. Fishing rods can be stored along the roof rack while integrated rod holders in the bumper are there for when the lines are cast. While shooting the breeze, the Yeti 125-quart cooler keeps your beverages chill and once the sun sets, the party can continue with lighting from KC, Rigid, and Baja Designs.
A Road Shower rack-mounted solar shower and teak wood deck was incorporated for washing off the salt and sand. For the interior, a set of WeatherTech floor mats help trap and contain any excess sand from that well-earned day on the beach.
In Person
The Nissan Titan Surfcamp heads west to the Pacific Ocean for the Supergirl Surf Pro in Oceanside, California beginning on July 27th. A complete spec sheet on this beach warrior is below the gallery.

2018/07/08,BMW Plant Spartanburg Prepping For X5 Production,"BMW’s Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina is prepping for production of the all-new X5. The forthcoming X5 will be the tenth X model produced at the facility since it opened in 1994. BMW’s manufacturing base in South Carolina is the single largest exporter of automobiles by value in the United States, according to the company.
Since the introduction of the X5 nearly 20 years ago, two of every three vehicles produced were exported to customers outside the U.S. When considering the Spartanburg-built X3, X4, X5, and X6 together, more than 70 percent of the annual production is shipped to export markets.
Increased Capacity
The X5 is one of BMW’s top-selling models in the U.S. as well, fueling enough growth in Spartanburg to make it BMW’s largest plant in the world. Overall, the X5 accounts for more than half of the 4.4 million vehicles produced at Spartanburg since its opening. Demand for X models is expected to rise globally, and officials say Spartanburg’s output will eventually reach the plant’s yearly capacity of 450,000 units.
Economic Footprint
When Plant Spartanburg opened in 1994, its shifts employed no more than 500 people, contrasted with 10,000 today and another 1,000 expected to join the team by 2021. BMW’s parts and materials purchases for production totaled nearly $6 billion in the U.S. last year, coming from more than 300 American supplier companies.
A recent study by the University of South Carolina found that for every 10 jobs that are directly generated at a U.S. BMW facility, an additional 90 jobs are created elsewhere in the U.S. economy as a direct result of those jobs.
Production & Training
BMW X5 production begins later this summer. In the meantime, new employees will undergo a dual apprenticeship training program that utilizes classroom learning and firsthand experience.

2018/07/07,McLaren 600LT: One Rare Bird,"The new McLaren 600LT is here. The LT stands for “Longtail” and McLaren is making a bit of a fetish of what it means. What it all comes down to though is that the new 600LT is the fastest, most powerful and most track-focused, but still road legal, Sports Series McLaren yet.
Still road legal?
Music to my ears.
Longer & Lighter
This longtail stuff (one word in the preferred nomenclature) all started with the F1 GTR Longtail, a racing permutation of the fantastic F1 three-seater. It later showed up in a variant of the 675, the McLaren 675LT, and now the McLaren 600LT. From the outside, the most notable features of the 600LT are the extra, 2.9 inches added to the back end, the extended front splitter, lengthened rear diffuser (of course), and fixed rear wing.
You can’t see all the weight saving they did on this beast, but Woking was able to trim a substantial 211.6 lbs. off the 570S Coupé and its base measurements. The chassis is a lightweight carbon fiber “monocoque” (of course) and there’s also new carbon fiber bodywork to lower weight and optimize aero performance.
McLaren has also added top-exit exhausts for the new LT model, and I’m sure there’s sound engineering reasons for that – in the 600LT’s case, that would be a “substantial weight savings” – but it also seems like these top-exit exhausts are turning into some sort of fashion statement since Porsche first used them on their sublime 918 Spyder.
Less Is More
The interior of the track-focused but still road legal 600LT is pretty minimalist. There are carbon fiber racing seats that were first seen on the McLaren P1 and lightweight Alcantara trim throughout. If the P1-sourced seats aren’t enough, you can opt for super-lightweight carbon fiber seats developed for the McLaren Senna. And if you want even more, other weight saving options include a carbon fiber roof and cantrails and vented carbon fiber front fenders.
If you tick every lightweight option box, the lightest dry weight of the new McLaren 600LT is as low as 2,749.2 lbs.
Power & Performance
Motive force for the 600LT is supplied by a twin-turbocharged, 3.8-liter V8 with an uprated cooling system for 592 horsepower and a maximum torque output of 457 lb-ft. The power-to-weight ratio of the McLaren 600LT is an inspiring 474 horsepower per ton.
The McLaren 600LT rides on the forged aluminum double-wishbone suspension and the braking system from the second-generation McLaren Super Series. The tires are (what else?) Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires; the steering is quicker, and the throttle and brake pedal responses have been sharpened. And along with mounting the exhausts virtually behind the driver’s shoulder, the significantly firmer engine mounts should bring incredible sounds from the powertrain into the cabin.

Yum!
Manufacturing & Availability
Production of the hand-assembled 600LT Coupé will begin this October at the McLaren Production Centre in Woking, Surrey and should last a year, but no word on the total number McLaren will make. The company only says that volume will be “strictly limited.”
You might want to head down to your McLaren dealer and check, however, since the 600LT is still available to order. Sadly, no word on price, but whatever it turns out to be, purchasing your new 600LT Coupé also includes the tuition for the Pure McLaren Road Owner Track Day.

2018/07/05,Volvo Launches Stand-Alone Personal Mobility Service,"Volvo Cars has launched a new, stand-alone brand simply titled “M” that will provide on-demand access to cars and other mobility services through an app. M will also learn the preferences and habits of each individual user in an effort to create a more personalized experience.
“Volvo Cars is becoming more than just a car company,” explained Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars President and Chief Executive. “We recognize that urban consumers are rethinking traditional car ownership. M is part of our answer.”
Personalized Service
M will go beyond merely informing users where they can pick up their car. A proprietary learning technology, currently under development, can ask users what their needs are.
“We are evolving to become a direct-to-consumer services provider under our new mission ‘Freedom to Move’,” Samuelsson continued. “The launch of M creates new sources of revenue for Volvo Cars and will be integral to the company’s ambition to build more than 5 million direct consumer relationships by the middle of the next decade.”
“The services currently available mainly offer alternatives to a taxi or public transit,” said Bodil Eriksson, CEO of Volvo Car Mobility. “We’re focused on the way people use the cars they own, which sets us apart. We aim to provide a real alternative to that experience. It should enable us to live life on our terms, getting things done and maximizing precious time.”
Markets & Locations
Volvo Car Group has also partnered with Sunfleet, a top car sharing company in Sweden where M will first be put into service. The company will be fully integrated into M next year, making the service available to all existing Sunfleet members. Further information will be released later this year, although M is slated to debut in the United States next spring.
“Stockholm, Sweden, will serve as M’s base of development and where we already conduct extensive testing,” Eriksson added. “A broader Beta test will take place this autumn.”

2018/07/04,"Hyundai Motor, Autotalks Begin Partnership Centered On V2X Technology","Hyundai Motor has begun a strategic partnership with Autotalks, a technology company that specializes in the manufacturing of Vehicle to Everything – sometimes stylized as “V2X” – communication chipsets. V2X technology allows vehicles to communicate with each other, as well as road users and infrastructure.
Officials say the strategic partnership comes as a result of a direct investment from Hyundai to accelerate the development and eventual deployment of V2X technology for autonomous cars.
Connected Approach
In human-operated vehicles, V2X systems relay important information in the form of alerts and notifications, and can also actuate the vehicle in dangerous situations. In self-driving vehicles, V2X complements existing sensors, allowing them to make more informed decisions on busy roads.
“Connectivity is one of the core technologies that can be applied to smart city business models, as well as autonomous driving and infotainment,” explained Yunseong Hwang, director of open innovation business group at Hyundai Motor Company.
“Having a top global car manufacturer such as Hyundai invest directly in Autotalks is not only a vote of confidence in the company, but a testament to the growing V2X market,” added Hagai Zyss, Autotalks CEO. “Hyundai’s pursuit of cutting-edge communication and safety technologies is a perfect match with Autotalks’ leading V2X capabilities.”
Existing Platforms
Earlier this year, Hyundai announced a strategic partnership with Aurora to bring self-driving vehicles to the market by 2021. The automaker was already granted a licence in Nevada in 2015 to test automated vehicles on the state’s public roads, and last year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Hyundai publicly demonstrated their autonomous technology.
“Hyundai Motor will continue to invest in disruptive technologies that are in line with Hyundai’s current and future strategic pillars,” Hwang said.

2018/07/03,2019 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye: Frankenstein’s Fury,"Leave it to the Dodge boys to not leave well enough alone. As a matter of fact, “not leaving well enough alone” is kind of a company trademark. How else could you explain stuffing a 426 Hemi into a Dodge Dart? Speaking of putting in engines that are too big for everyday rides, say hello to the 2019 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye.
Essentially, what we have here, is car engineering a la Dr. Frankenstein; a little bit from here, a little bit from there, and a brain clearly labeled “A.B. Normal.” I’m fine with that.
Wide & Wild
The 2019 Hellcat Redeye (no real explanation as to why they call it that) is, like all Mopar products since time immemorial – or at least since the end of The War – 99.999% about dat engine yo! Take the supercharged Hemi Demon V8 out of the quickest, fastest, and most powerful muscle car ever, and stuff it into this latest demi-ogre, and abracadabra: The 797 horsepower 2019 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye!
Yes, the new 2019 Redeye is available with the Widebody Package. Yes, this definitely looks cooler than a bug on ice. Yes, you’re now 3.5 inches wider overall with improved handling and braking. Yes, the Redeye comes with larger, six-piston Brembo front brakes, wider wheels and tires, and the suspension upgrades featured on the “normal” R/T Scat Pack Widebody. Yes, the interior has some cool upgrades and there are some special wheels but, honestly, who cares about all that other stuff when you’re confronted with a powerplant like this?
Heavy Equipment
The heart of the 2019 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye is sourced from its (sadly) limited-production big brother: the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon. That would be the supercharged, 6.2-liter big block Hemi rated at a staggering 797 horsepower and a just as astounding 707 lb-ft. of torque. Or, about the same torque as an ocean-going tug. The blown 6.2 Hemi is mated to a TorqueFlite 8HP90 eight-speed automatic transmission with internals that must have a Hulk-like disposition to things like heat, shear forces, sun-like thermal loading and such.
The Redeye mill has 25 major upgrades, including a larger supercharger, strengthened con-rods and pistons, a high-speed valve train and, thankfully, an improved lubrication system. The Redeye’s supercharged high-output engine features the largest factory supercharger on any production car: 2.7 liters, or about the displacement of a smaller BMW engine. Consider that for a moment: The blower on this thing is bigger than the engine in your car (most likely).
RELATED
GM Shares Face Mask Production Blueprint With Other Suppliers
Said supercharger has increased boost pressure (14.5 psi) and a higher rpm limit of 6,500 rpm.
Binge Drinking
The Redeye is so thirsty it has two dual-stage fuel pumps versus the normal single pump found on lesser models. How thirsty? This thirsty: At full throttle, the high-output Hemi ingests and consumes 1.43 gallons of fuel per minute. That’s enough to completely drain the tank in just under 11 minutes – or a burn rate slightly better than a Saturn V moon rocket.
Somehow though, the Redeye still gets 22 miles per gallon in “normal” highway conditions. So dig that: It is both way faster and more powerful than a 1969 Hemi ‘Cuda (for instance) yet gets about double the fuel mileage.
You will note the new dual-snorkel hood. This new bonnet is one of three sources of intake air along with the driver’s-side Air Catcher headlamp Inlet near the wheel liner to feed the new, larger air induction box.
Hard Candy
Other goodies borrowed from the SRT Demon include Torque Reserve to deliver up to 3.9 psi of boost at launch and up to 55 percent more engine torque. Torque Reserve is active once the engine speed passes 950 rpm, and closes the bypass valve to “pre-fill” the intake with boost while better managing fuel flow and spark timing. Also along for that very short drag-strip ride are high-strength steel prop shafts for a 15 percent increase in torque capacity, and 41-spline half shafts to boost torque capacity another 20 percent.
And if you want to get all old school with this . . . this . . . beast? Ogre? Animal? Whatever, dig: The 2019 SRT Hellcat Redeye offers your choice of two final drive ratios, the standard 2.62:1 or the available 3.09:1 for “enhanced” launch capability. Trust me, you want the 3.09 gears.
All of this adds up to the 2019 Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye being one of the most powerful muscle cars in history: 1/4-mile E.T. of 10.8 seconds at 131 mph and a top speed of 203 mph. You got the timing slips to beat that? Bring ’em!
Manufacturing & Availability
Production begins this fall at the Brampton, Ontario Assembly Plant, with the Challengers arriving at dealerships in the fourth quarter.

2018/07/02,The Aston Martin DBS Superleggera Should “Nose” Out The Competition,"Have you ever looked across a crowded room and said to yourself, “Wow, he or she sure is hot . . . except for that nose!” Yeah, well, the new Aston Martin DBS Superleggera is like that. It works from a whole bunch of different angles, but the entire grille treatment is way off.
Specifically, the radiator aperture, the opening, is way too big and out of proportion with the rest of the car. Sure, I understand there are thermodynamic concerns here (i.e. this thing has to put out a ton of heat and has cooling needs slightly less than Chernobyl on a bad day) but the people from Gaydon could have finessed that a little better.
Team Effort
Or, let’s set the dead fish where it belongs, at the Milanese drafting tables of Superleggera, the Italian design maestros that sculpted the Aston Martin DBS Superleggera. Superleggera, the Italian auto design firm famed for their work on early Ferraris, Alfas, Lancias and such, were tapped by the venerable Aston Martin to have a tilt at a sort of hot-rodded DBS, and the result is pretty fantastic.
Apart from that nose.
Of course this is not the first time AM and Superleggera have worked together, having collaborated on the DB4, 5, and 6 Mark 1. The new DBS Superleggera is clothed in impeccably sculpted carbon fiber body panels. Gone are the days of the Italian firm using ultra-thin aluminum alloy body panels, hand beaten into shape and then suspended over the spaceframe chassis with a multitude of teeny, tiny little tubes to hold the entire thing up.
Nah, time marches on, and as cool and old school as that was, molding even lighter body panels out of composites is a much better way to go.
Power & Performance
All this new tech adds up to a dry weight of 1693kg (around 3,700 lbs.) and tips the weights and measures with a 51:49 weight distribution. In other words, just a little nose heavy. Which sort of follows, given that the DBS Superleggera is powered by Aston Martin’s 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12, cranking out 725PS and 900Nm of torque. That translates as 715 ponies and around 660 lb-ft. of grunt.
All this veddy British goodness rides on your choice of two alloy wheels: the standard “Y” Spoke Forged Wheel or the Lightweight Twin Spoke Forged Wheel. Both are mounted with Pirelli tires.
Add all that up and the DBS Superleggera dispatches a zero to 62 mph time of just 3.4 seconds, hits 100 mph in 6.4 seconds, and tops out at 211 mph. Aston further mentions this beast of a ride has enough mid-range power to accelerate from 50 to 100 mph in 4.2 seconds. In fourth gear. Impressive.

Transmission, Chassis & Technology
Speaking of gears, the DBS Superleggera uses a new, rear-mounted ZF eight-speed automatic/mechanical limited-slip differential with torque vectoring. Yes, the DBS Superleggera is rear-wheel drive only. The chassis itself is the latest generation of the lightweight bonded aluminum structures first seen on Aston’s DB11. There’s forged double wishbones at the front and a multi-link system at the back. Adaptive damping is standard, and both the powertrain and chassis offer three dynamic modes; GT, Sport, and Sport Plus.
And although the Superleggera aims to be “Super Light” as the name implies, it does not scrimp on the goodies. Keyless entry, tire pressure monitoring system, a 360-degree camera, and Park Assist are in the mix. The stereo has DAB plus Bluetooth audio and phone streaming, and iPod, iPhone, and USB playback.
The satellite navigation system is fully integrated; the WiFi hub, plus all the in-car infotainment systems use a central LCD screen, controlled via a dial.
Pricing & Availability
Prices start at $304,995 in the USA with deliveries expected to begin this fall.

2018/06/29,2019 Dodge Charger Lineup: The Automotive Industry’s John Bender,"The Dodge Charger is the captain of the Detroit Muscle team; there is no better example of a modern day muscle car. On the whole, Dodge is becoming (even more so) the most rebellious brand in the automotive industry with their amped-up Chargers, Challengers, and Durangos. As things shift toward electrification and automation, and as countless small SUVs flood the market, Dodge is flying a pirate flag through a sea of Claire Standish wannabes.
The 2019 Charger lineup is proof Dodge is not budging from the table. By all accounts, they have propped their feet up, typical of their John Bender attitude.
“Despite a shift toward utility vehicles in the United States over the past decade, the Dodge Charger and Challenger continue to buck the trend,” explained Steve Beahm, Head of Passenger Car Brands, Dodge//SRT, Chrysler and Fiat – FCA North America. “Charger and Challenger retail sales have increased 70 percent since 2008, and since the launch of Scat Pack in August 2014, high-performance model sales increased from four percent to more than 25 percent.”
Here is a look at the Dodge Charger lineup for 2019.
Charger SRT Hellcat
The Hellcat is the big dog in the 2019 Charger lineup, standing as the quickest, fastest, and most powerful sedan in the world. The supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 twists out 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft. of torque, and comes connected to a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters. Helping this massive Hemi breathe are dual inlets that feed cooler outside air into the engine compartment.
The Launch Assist feature uses the Hellcat’s wheel speed sensors to watch for driveline-damaging wheel hop when launching. If hop is detected, engine torque is modified within milliseconds to regain grip. With Line Lock, the front brakes engage and the rear is left open for burnouts to heat up and clean the tires.
After arriving for that late night jazz show (it’s where I would take it), the Charger Hellcat will employ its After-Run Chiller system. This allows the supercharger/charge air cooler to continue cooling down after the engine is turned off.
Charger R/T Scat Pack
This Super Bee can sting rival pony cars with its naturally-aspirated 392 Hemi V8 and TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic. The aforementioned Launch Assist and Line lock are now standard on the Scat Pack which puts 485 horsepower and 475 lb-ft. of torque to the pavement. Optional for 2019 is a Bilstein three-mode Adaptive Damping Suspension system.
Inside, drivers are treated to a “Dark Dub Plate” instrument panel and Houndstooth cloth performance seats with plenty of bolstering. When the Scat Pack’s Launch Control feature is engaged, those seats are greatly appreciated. The system coordinates the engine, transmission, driveline, and suspension for hard straight-line sprints.

In the words of Samuel L. Jackson from Jurassic Park: “Hold Onto Your Butts.”
Charger R/T
A solid daily driver, the R/T comes with the evergreen 5.7-liter Hemi V8, good for 370 horsepower and 395 lb-ft. of torque. The performance-oriented chassis includes the suspension and steering to match; the TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic and 2.62 rear axle ratio are both standard.
The R/T gets a makeover for 2019 with a new hood, fascia, side sills, spoiler, and seats. Opt for the Cold Weather Package and get a heated steering wheel and heated seats.
Charger SXT AWD
Powered by the Pentastar V6, the SXT AWD returns a healthy 27 mpg on the highway. The all-wheel drive system is complete with an active transfer case and “front-axle disconnect” to increase overall efficiency. The Pentastar V6 is attached to a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic and delivers 300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft. of torque.
A new Caramel Nappa leather interior and the aforementioned Cold Weather Package are among the available options.
Charger GT
With the same horsepower and torque specs at the SXT AWD, the GT is another ideal daily driver. Like the R/T, the GT gets a new hood, fascia, side sills, spoiler, and seats – and the newly available 20-inch Satin Carbon and Black Noise wheels don’t hurt anything either.
The vehicle’s systems and controls are accessed through an 8.4-inch Uconnect screen, which includes the Dodge Performance Pages like the upper models have.
Charger SXT
Every muscle car needs a mild cruiser and the SXT certinately fits the bill at 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. Still the Pentastar V6, still the TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic, just toned down a bit. Standard features are plentiful: electronic stability control, remote start, cruise control, electric power steering, automatic halogen projector headlamps with LED accents, and three 12-volt power outlets.
The aforementioned Caramel Nappa leather interior and Cold Weather Package are both available.
Colorful Array
What makes the Dodge Charger such an enticing car is the color palette: B5 Blue, Destroyer Grey, F8 Green, Go Mango, Granite Crystal, IndiGo Blue, Maximum Steel, Octane Red, Pitch Black, Plum Crazy, TorRed, Triple Nickel, and White Knuckle.
Hard to pick a favorite.
Availability
The 2019 Dodge Charger is expected in showrooms in the third quarter of this year, although any of the above models can be ordered now. The Charger is on track to lead the large car segment in the U.S. for the fifth straight year.

2018/06/29,2019 Volvo S60: South Carolina’s Tasty Little Treat,"Volvo Cars simultaneously rolled out a new car and a new manufacturing facility the other day. That’s a double you don’t see happening very often. The new car in question is the S60 sedan, and the factory is the company’s first American manufacturing plant, located outside Charleston, South Carolina. The Swedes say the factory opening reinforces Volvo Cars’ commitment to the United States, and shows how serious they are about the new S60.
Electric Avenue
Volvo points out how the new S60 is the first Volvo car to be sold without a diesel engine. Volvo says this signals “the company’s industry-leading commitment to electrification and a future beyond the traditional combustion engine.” I say it also shows that Volvo doesn’t want to get caught up in a Scandinavian version of diesel-gate and end up with various board members being thrown into Saltvik Prison. (BTW, when looking up a funny Swedish prison name, I came across this: Prison Life in Scandinavia – Discover Scandinavia; seriously dude, an article from a Scandinavian tourist site about how great their prisons are!)
But it’s more than just that, Volvo seems very serious about this whole EV thing, saying that from 2019 all new models will be electrified.

This new, American-built S60 will be propelled by the company’s turbo and supercharged T8 Twin Engine Plug­-In Hybrid system. The internal combustion plant puts out 313 horsepower and the rear electric motor adds another 87 for a combined, healthy power output of 400 horsepower. Tasty!
In addition to the T8 version, the T5 front-wheel drive, and T6 all-wheel drive will also be available.
The new S60 shares the Scalable Product Architecture platform with other Volvo cars, such as the new V60 wagon and XC60.
Safety & Security
And, since this is a Volvo, it’s about as safe as a castle. There’s the City Safety system with Autobrake technology to assist the driver in avoiding potential collisions. Volvo says City Safety is the only system on the market that can recognize pedestrians, cyclists, and large animals and can engage auto braking to mitigate oncoming collisions.
There’s an optional Pilot Assist system to support you with steering, acceleration, and braking on well-marked roads up to 80 mph. The S60 also comes with Run­off Road Mitigation, Oncoming Lane Mitigation, and other steering assistance nannies.
Infotainment? Oh sure: The Sensus Connect system is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and works via a tablet style touchscreen interface that combines car functions, navigation, connected services, and various entertainment apps.

Pricing & Availability
The T5 FWD, T6 AWD, and T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid will carry an MSRP of $35,800, $40,300, and $54,400 respectively. The new S60 will also be “sold” via Volvo’s new subscription service, Care by Volvo. The subscription deal means no down payment and a monthly flat rate. No worrying about maintenance and that sort of thing.
A well-equipped S60 T6 AWD Momentum is available for $775 a month through the program; an S60 T6 AWD R-Design can be had for $850 a month.
The new S60 also has a Polestar Engineered variant, which includes upgrades to the exterior and interior design, wheels, brakes, suspension, and engine control unit. This is the one you want to buy, but they will be extremely limited.

2018/06/28,A Brief Look At The 2019 Chevy Volt,"With a new propulsion system, the 2019 Chevy Volt will slice charging times nearly in half, being better suited for “opportunity charging,” or plugging in while around town to top off the battery.
“With about twice the range added during 240V Level 2 charging sessions, the 2019 Volt’s 7.2 kW system makes opportunity charging more worthwhile,” explained Jesse Ortega, Chief Engineer, Chevrolet Electric Vehicles. “It effectively extends the vehicle’s all-electric driving range, while providing about twice the range for the money when plugging in at public facilities that charge by the hour.”
Charging & Capacities
With the new 7.2 kW system, a 240-volt outlet, and supporting hardware, a total recharge happens in just over two hours. The new system is standard on Premier trims but available for the LT. A 3.6 kW charger is standard on the Volt LT.
Chevy says the new electric propulsion system, combined with a full tank of gas and a full charge, offers an EPA-estimated 53 miles of pure EV range and 106 MPGe. When the Volt’s battery runs low, a gas-powered generator activates to extend the driving range to a total of 420 miles on a full tank.
The 2019 Volt also utilizes an automatic, engine-assisted heating system for temperatures below zero to increase all-electric range. New Low and Regen on Demand profiles boost regenerative braking capability, according to Chevrolet.
Technology & Features
The Infotainment 3 system includes an 8-inch-diagonal color touchscreen with a new Energy App. The app’s “Impacts Screen” shows how driving style, route, weather, and cabin settings affect range and conveys said impacts in terms of mileage.
A new Power Convenience Package, an extension of the Comfort Package, is available for the LT, adding a six-way power driver’s seat. The wireless charging pad is relocated ahead of the shifter, while a new digital rearview camera replaces the previous analog system. Safety features include Adaptive Cruise Control and a pedestrian alert system.
“The 2019 Volt’s enhancements give customers more of what they love with the vehicle and make it even more useful as an everyday electric vehicle,” Ortega said. “It’s a more seamless experience than ever.”
Pricing & Availability
Chevrolet did not disclose pricing but says the 2019 Volt should arrive this fall. New color themes include a Pacific Blue Metallic for the exterior, and a Jet Black/Porcelain Blue for the Premier’s interior. An available, dealer-installed blackout package includes sport pedals, black front/rear bowtie emblems, and 17-inch machined-aluminum wheels with black-painted pockets.
To date, Volt owners have driven more than 2.8 billion EV miles, saving more than 108 million gallons of gas.

2018/06/28,Toyota Research Institute Joins Study On How Autonomous Cars Will Impact Workforce,"The Toyota Research Institute (TRI) is contributing $75,000 to the American Center for Mobility (ACM) for an analysis on how autonomous cars will impact driving-related jobs. ACM’s study, Preparing the Workforce for Automated Vehicles, is being conducted by Michigan State University in collaboration with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.
“TRI is committed to advancing automated vehicle technology in ways that improve society and individual well-being, and we need to better understand the impact this may have on future jobs and employment,” said Dr. Gill Pratt, TRI CEO and Toyota Motor Corporation Fellow. “Our participation in this study can help address the societal effects in a meaningful way.”
Careful Examination
Officials say the research will provide key insight into the types of jobs that will be affected and to what degree. The study will also identify the skills and education needed for a more automated future. One of the study’s main objectives is to consider a “training template” for commercial drivers, especially in the areas of freight and package delivery, and taxi and ride-hailing.
“If autonomous vehicles become the norm, then truck drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and Uber or Lyft drivers certainly will be impacted – and not in a good way,” Cliff Banks, President of The Banks Report, an automotive retail publication, told us in a special feature on autonomous cars in May. “I’ve watched Uber or Lyft drivers walk up to a house and help an elderly person down the stairs. Can an autonomous vehicle do that?”
Forward Looking
Toyota Motor North America was recently announced as a founding member of the Partnership for Transportation Innovation and Opportunity, a collaboration committed to exploring how autonomous vehicles will impact American workers as well as identifying opportunities to address future challenges. TRI is also in the process of constructing an autonomous vehicle test track in Michigan.
Preparing the Workforce for Automated Vehicles is expected to be published later this year.
“Industry involvement is paramount as we undergo this study, especially when we consider the implications on talent and how the potential needs of employers will shift,” said Soraya Kim, ACM’s Chief Innovation Officer and the study’s leader. “We thank TRI for their continued commitment and for being a partner to get this important work done.”

2018/06/27,2019 Honda Insight: The 55 MPG Beast,"The 2019 Honda Insight hybrid is here, and it offers a whole lot of practicality and reliability with a familiar Honda face – none of that goofy, “look at me driving my car from Mars styling” (cough, Prius, cough) – and it gets you 55 MPG in the city.
Fifty-Five? Holy Sh-
Features & Trim Levels
It is, indeed, a relatively normal looking car. I’m not sure why the first gen hybrids, Priuseseseses and such, had to go with such goofy styling, but all I can assume is that now the car buying public is used to what a hybrid is, and Honda figures they’ll be more comfortable buying them regardless of the wrapper.
Honda says the 2019 Insight has an EPA rating of up to 55 mpg in the city, lots of premium features, and starts at $22,830. Which strikes me as very inexpensive for what you get in the three different trim levels: LX, EX, and Touring. All trim levels come standard with multi-element LED headlights, push-button start (racy!), and the Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assist technologies.
Other Insight EX goodies include the eight-inch display/audio system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Insight Touring adds leather seating surfaces, an eight-way power driver’s seat, Honda’s Satellite-Linked Navigation System, and dual-zone automatic climate control.
But let’s face it, Honda figured out how to make near-perfect automotive interiors back in the 80s. All the cool, discussion worthy stuff here lies under the hood, or unseen altogether.
Power & Performance
The 2019 Insight is motivated by a third-gen Honda two-motor hybrid drivetrain. A 1.5-liter DOHC i-VTEC Atkinson-cycle inline-4 engine does the heavy lifting, and features a 40.5-percent thermal efficiency rating. That ICE is mated to an electric propulsion motor, cranking out 197 lb-ft. of torque. The whole shootin’ match adds up to a total system output of 151 horsepower.
Honda points out how this two-motor design allows the Insight to run without the need for a conventional automatic transmission. Hmmm, I bet tearing the drivetrain apart on one of these guys would be interesting and fun.
Honda further tweaks the energy regeneration system through the use of steering wheel-mounted Deceleration Selectors. These work similar to transmission paddle shifters, and allow you to toggle between three different levels of regenerative braking performance. Grab the left selector to increase regenerative braking, and the right to reduce it. Honda says the system not only increases battery charging via regeneration, but also helps reduce strain on the brakes themselves, letting the driver tailor their regenerative braking level for different conditions.

And yeah, that’s cool and all that, but why don’t you people make an Si variant where the paddles allow you to tailor performance? Just a thought.
Drive Modes & Battery Placement
The full hybrid powertrain on the Insight uses power from all systems – the gasoline engine and electric motors –  to accommodate the driving conditions you might find yourself in, moment to moment, and can seamlessly shift through three distinct drive schemes.
In EV Drive, the Insight is powered completely by its electric drive motor, drawing power from the battery. In Hybrid Drive, the gasoline engine drives a generator that supplies electrical power to the drive motor and, in certain circumstances, Engine Drive operation connects the gasoline engine directly to the drive wheels, the way Gottlieb Daimler intended.
The battery for the 2019 Insight lives under the rear seats, housed in something called a “compact intelligent power unit.” The clever packaging solution allows the Insight to offer an impressive 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space. You can fold the rear seatback for long loads (with a 60/40 split in EX and Touring trims), and there’s a grand total of up to 97.6 cubic feet of interior space.
Manufacturing & Pricing
The 2019 Insight will join Honda’s lineup of electrified vehicles, alongside the Clarity series – Clarity Fuel Cell, Clarity Electric, and Clarity Plug-In Hybrid – and the new Accord Hybrid. The 2019 Insight is manufactured at Honda’s Greensburg, Indiana plant, while the 1.5-liter Atkinson-cycle two-motor system, intelligent power unit, and hybrid battery pack is produced in Ohio.
Below is a handy chart that shows you the breakdown for the 2019 Honda Insight.

2018/06/26,2019 Ram 1500 “Classic” To Sell Alongside All-New Model,"A new addition – or perhaps existing family member – is coming to the Ram truck lineup. A “Classic Badge” is planned and will be sold alongside the all-new 2019 Ram 1500. The truck maker will offer both the 2019 Ram 1500 Classic (known internally as the “DS” model) and the all-new Ram 1500 (internally as “DT”) at its North American dealers through 2018.
“As we launch the all-new 2019 Ram 1500, we didn’t want to walk away from a key part of the light-duty truck market,” explained Mike Manley, Head of Ram Brand – FCA. “Ram will continue to produce the 1500 Classic targeted at entry and commercial buyers.”
Ram says the 1500 Classic carries a number of segment-exclusive features in areas “most important to truck buyers.” The truck maker points to their link-coil rear suspension and RamBox bedside storage system that allows for easier cargo hauling. The all-new 2019 Ram 1500 was subjected to an extensive redesign before hitting the market, something we learned about in-depth earlier this year.
Packages & Trim Levels
The Classic will be available as a Regular Cab with an 8 or 6 foot, 4 inch-bed; Quad Cab with a 6 foot, 4 inch-bed; Crew Cab short bed (5 feet, 7 inches), or a Crew Cab with an optional 6 foot, 4 inch-bed. The Classic comes with three powertrian choices (4×2 or 4×4): the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, 5.7-liter Hemi, and the 3.0-liter EcoDiesel, although Ram says the diesel will not be available until later on.
The Classic has three new packages: Chrome Plus, offered for the Tradesman, which includes chrome bumpers, 17-inch wheels, and keyless entry; the Tradesman SXT, which also includes chrome bumpers, plus a five-inch radio display, fog lamps, dual exhaust for the Hemi models, and 20-inch wheels; finally, the “Express Black Accent Package” for the Express trim adds a number of blacked-out elements, including the wheels, headlight bezels, and badging.
Tradesman, Express, Big Horn/Lone Star, and SSV (Special Services Vehicle) make up the available trim levels.
Manufacturing & Availability
The 2019 Ram 1500 Classic is built at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Warren, Michigan. Since opening in 1938, the facility has produced more than 12.5 million trucks. Regular Cab and some Crew Cab Classic models will be built at the Saltillo Truck Assembly Plant in Saltillo, Mexico.
Expect the Ram 1500 Classic at Ram dealerships in the fourth quarter of this year.

2018/06/26,"Iconic Lamborghini Miura SVR Restored By Automaker’s New, Special Division","Like seemingly every other high end car maker in the known universe, Lamborghini has gotten into the factory restoration business. They call it Lamborghini Polo Storico, and no, I have no idea what the Polo is about (I checked and it has nothing to do with Ralph Lauren). And I’ve got to say, good choice of cars to start with Lamborghini: A Miura SVR.
Family Tree
Lambo’s Miura needs no introduction for you cognoscenti out there. The Miura, named after a famous breeder of Spanish fighting bulls (indeed, it was a Miura, Isolero, that gored and killed the great Manolete in 1947); the “normal” ones are interesting enough: transverse mid-engine V12, glorious styling courtesy of Gandini, all that kind of stuff. Then Ferruccio tweaked it a little, and made the Miura P400, then the P400 S, then the P400 SV, the SV Jota (which should have been the final version) and at the top of the hill, performance and rarity-wise, the P400 SVR.
This particular Miura, chassis number 3781, engine number 2511, and body number 383, started out as an S version and was originally painted in Verde Miura with black interior, or green over black. It was originally delivered to the Lamborauto dealership in Turin, on November 30th 1968, after being displayed at the 50th Turin Motor Show. After changing hands a staggering eight times by 1974, it was bought by a German guy, Heinz Straber. Straber took it back to Sant’Agata to have it converted into an SVR race car.
This job was turned around after a rocket-fast 18 months of work (18!!).
Traveling Abroad
Then the ownership trail got seriously odd. In 1976, the car was sold to a Japanese fella by the name of Hiromitsu Ito, who took it home to Japan. Lambo says that, once there, it caused “quite a sensation,” which is an understatement of the first order. The Miura SVR was the inspiration for the Circuit Wolf manga comic book series. The fabled Miura SVR, a race car evolution of the Jota, was developed by Lamborghini test driver Bob Wallace and, after Wallace totaled his Jota in an accident, ceaseless customer demand led Automobili Lamborghini to build a few Miura SVJ models and a single Miura SVR, which turned out to be chassis 3781.
Then 3781, which served as the “model” for the vehicle used in the Circuit Wolf comic book, was used as the reference model for the Kyosho toy version.
Which brings us up to more or less the present day, when Lambo got the thing back, returned to its former splendor by the Polo Storico specialists. Fittingly, it was then exhibited during an event organized in its honor at Nakayama Circuit in Japan.

GM Shares Face Mask Production Blueprint With Other Suppliers
“The full restoration took 19 months and required a different approach to the way we normally work,” explained Paolo Gabrielli, Director of the Polo Storico and Lamborghini Head of After Sales. “The original production sheet wasn’t of much help, as we relied mostly on the specifications from the 1974 modifications. The challenge for the Polo Storico team was even more daunting as the car arrived in Sant’Agata in pieces, although the parts were all there, and with considerable modifications.”
Handle With Care
Lamborghini Polo Storico, based at the company’s HQ in Sant’Agata Bolognese, is the specialized unit dedicated to the restoration and certification of Lamborghini models that have been out of production for at least 10 years. So it functions as Lambo’s version of Ferrari’s Classiche or Lancia/Abarth’s White Book programs.
Polo Storico will preserve archives and records, and manage the supply of original spare parts for classic cars, which comes as a sigh of relief for Diablo owners looking for fuel injection control computers (seriously, go look it up if you want a good laugh).
Expect to see more spectacularly-restored Lamborghinis emerging from the Polo Storico shops, but I have to say, it will be very hard to top this one.

2018/06/25,Corvette C7.R To Race In WEC In Shanghai: An Inside Look,"Hmmm, I wonder how the Chinese market will take to the Corvette? Or at least the C7.R race model that will be competing at the fascinating Shanghai circuit this coming November for the final round of the 2018 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).
That’s not the end of the championship, but who cares. This does mark a pretty important milestone for Corvette racing.
Straight Away
The race in question will be the 6 Hours of Shanghai, running November 18th at the 16-turn, 5.45-km Shanghai International Circuit. The track, one of the Hermann Tilke specials, has been around since 2004, and the venue plays host to a number of Motorsports’ championships, including the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix. Two of the track’s more salient features, or at least they’re important if you’re a Corvette racer (or a ‘Murican), are these two massively long straights, where horsepower and top speed reign supreme.
So that makes for particularly auspicious timing for Chevrolet to close Corvette Racing’s 20th season of competition in grand style by hopefully winning (i.e. crushing) the competition at Shanghai. This specific C7.R will wear a special Redline livery for the race weekend and it will also be the first factory-run Corvette to race in Asia.
Badge Engineering
This Redline thing is a special livery to promote the launch of the Redline special edition in China. Curiously, this all dates back to the 2015 SEMA Show where a custom concept Redline Corvette made its debut. There was a “strong positive response,” according to Chevrolet – or at least enough of a response for the bean-counters at corporate HQ to green light making a limited edition run of the thing. Or, things, to be more accurate.
Redline is a special edition portfolio for China, with this Vette being the first of four models entering the domestic market this year. In the future, nearly all Chevrolet models in China will have Redline variants. Anyway, as you can see from the photo above (sadly, they only shared one with us), this Redline Corvette racer is a dark gray, silver, black, and anthracite-colored thing with red highlights on the stripes and flashes on the end-plates.
Ah, Generic Motors, the people who invented badge “engineering”. . . don’t ever change!
Best of the Best
The WEC, for those of you with the mental capacity of a lowland gorilla and the taste to match, is the world’s key sports car series. This is where the big boys come out to play, race, compete, and win at places like Sebring and Spa and, most importantly, Le Mans. None of the races are shorter than six hours, and the marquee events like Sebring and Le Mans are very long indeed. All of these races are run rain or shine, and in the case of Sebring and Le Mans, through the night as well.
RELATED
Genesis GV80: Inspired By South Korean Architectural Philosophy
The contests gauge not only speed and driver skill, but also the reliability and fuel economy of the cars.
And those of you with a patriotic bent will be happy to know that when it comes to running hot, straight, and true for a very long time, Corvettes are indeed good cars to have under you.
Extensive Resume
Corvette Racing has won 107 endurance races, 12 manufacturer championships in IMSA competition, captured 11 driver’s championships, were 11-time class champions at the Sebring 12-hours, racked up eight Le Mans 24-hour victories, three class championships at the Daytona 24-hours and did the Endurance Triple, winning at Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans in the same year, 2015.
Chevrolet, for all their button-down, lowest-cost-denominator plasticity, has every reason to point out that their company was founded and established by a race car driver named Louis Chevrolet more than a century ago. And it’s worth pointing out all this “win on Sunday, sell on Monday” calculating that Chevy has done, does allow one, if they are so motivated, to trot down to the local Chevrolet dealer and buy a brand new Corvette; let’s say a ZR1, shall we?
The ZR1 is not all that far removed from this C7.R race car, but they drive that one on the street.

2018/06/25,2019 Subaru Crosstrek: When You “Need” An SUV (But Really Don’t),"You don’t need an SUV. You really don’t. What you need is this, the Subaru Crosstrek. I mean, a reasonable person, right? Sometimes you might have to drive in pretty inclement weather? Sometimes you go camping? Regular skier or snowboarder? Live on a normal street? Rarely, if ever, have to take more than three people with you?
Yeah, the 2019 Subaru Crosstrek is for you.
Wants Versus Needs
Look, I get it. An SUV gives you a sense of security, and yeah, you might have to use it to get yourself out of a serious apocalyptic jam. But seriously, I know only three people who need an SUV: One is my friend Carl, who lives up in the middle of the woods in a log cabin on a reservation, the other is a doctor/avid snowboarder friend of mine who does emergency pediatric transport, and the other lives in the middle of Alaska.
Anyone else? 90 percent of the time, you’re just posing.
No, for what you actually use an SUV for, the Subaru Crosstrek (goofy name aside) has you covered. Effectively, the Crosstrek is an Impreza with a factory lift kit, some notional bash-plates, and that inherent Subaru all-weather capability baked in from the start. It’s a wagon, so it can haul a reasonable amount of people and stuff; it’s smaller so it’s easier to park and all that, and it gets much better gas mileage than that deuce-and-a-half you’re considering for grocery duty.
Packaged Performance
When it shows up at dealers later this summer, the 2019 Subaru Crosstrek will come in three flavors: 2.0i base, 2.0i Premium, and 2.0i Limited and ring out at just $100 more than last year, starting at $21,895. No matter the trim level, all 2019 Crosstreks come with standard EyeSight Driver Assist Technology, a safety nanny thing-o that combines features like Pre-Collision Braking and Throttle Management, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure and Sway Warning, and Lane Keep Assist in one nice package.
Since it’s a Subie, every Crosstrek comes standard with Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive. Does Subaru even make a non-AWD car? I don’t think so. The drivetrain also features such niceties as Active Torque Vectoring and Subie’s evergreen 2.0-liter 4-cylinder boxer engine, putting out 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft. of torque.
The Base and Premium trims have an optional six-speed manual or a Lineartronic CVT transmission. The CVT models will also get you X-MODE and Hill Descent Control.
Styling & Tech Treatments
The 2019 Subaru Crosstrek rides along with 8.7-inches of ground clearance and on 17-inch alloy wheels, in black, with a machined finish. On the inside, you’ll see the standard 6.5-inch Starlink Multimedia system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, 60/40-folding rear seat, multi-function display with fuel economy information, keyless entry, a security system with engine immobilizer and, I hope you’re sitting down: carpeted floor mats.

2018/06/23,"The 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata, Now With Moar Powerr","One of the oft-heard criticisms of Mazda’s fabulous Miata is that it lacks power. That’s a valid viewpoint, sure, but Mazda has slowly been addressing it, with the latest version putting out 151 ponies. Not bad for something that tips the scales at 2,300 lbs.
It could get even better though, and it has gotten better. Much better as a matter of fact.
The 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata comes with a thoroughly tweaked powertrain with 17 percent more power and even greater fuel efficiency.
Slim Fast Strategy
Yeah, yeah, I know, “The Miata is fun and all that, but the engine is weak.” I agree, but show me a gearhead that doesn’t want more power. Shoot, I’ve known vintage racers with 427 Cobras that complain about needing more top end.
Be all that as it may, Mazda, in their infinite wisdom, have not only boosted the current gen Miata’s power output, they have seriously gone through the engine itself, shaving weight, trimming reciprocating mass, paring down everything for greater efficiency and, like I said, more power.
Related: Fabulous and fun: Our full review of the 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata RF.
Fun & Ferocious
Mazda took the current SKYACTIV-G 2.0-liter four-banger and upped it to 181 horsepower at 7,000 rpm and 151 lb-ft. of torque at 4,000 rpm, giving the little guy a nice, broad usable range of Three-Grand between those peaks. Sharp-eyed readers will note the new redline sits at 7,500 rpm, up from the previous 6,800 rpm. That’s a 17 percent gain on the outgoing model and, with 181 ponies on tap in a 2,300 lbs. car, this is going to be fun.
It also means the SCCA is going to have to re-jigger their performance charts, because this new Miata should be an outright terror on the AutoX circuit.
Like I said, a little extra power never hurts and on top of that, the Hiroshima company also improved response, performance, feel, and efficiency across the board. The Mazda boffins were able to increase performance via several cunning, yet basically old school, hot-rodder tricks.
Textbook Examples
For starters, they reduced the internal mass and friction. Each piston has dropped 27g in mass by the minimized skirt areas. The con-rods are 41g lighter than before, which is a lot actually. The exhaust has been seriously tweaked with the upgraded engine carrying increased valve opening angles and valve lift heights. The exhaust manifold has a larger inner diameter that results in a 30 percent reduction in pumping losses.

The combustion process has been improved via reconfigured intake ports with new high-diffusion, high-pressure injectors. This refined the tumble and swirl of fuel to better-atomize it in the cylinder to boost efficiency and torque at all revs. As an added bonus, the new exhaust system sounds richer.
There is now a dual-mass flywheel that replaces the older, single-mass flywheel with a low-inertia unit to improve smoothness and responsiveness. The final drive ratio is also tweaked, being increased from 3.454 to 3.583 in order to improve linear response. Gear ratios are otherwise unchanged from previous versions.
These are all tried and true engine builder tricks from the beginning of the automobile: cut down on the reciprocating mass, lower internal friction, modify the valves, lower the internal friction some more, get the bad air moving out the exhaust system faster, you know, all the greatest hits.
Cup Holders? Cause ‘Murica!
Besides the engine sharpening, the 2019 MX-5 introduces an available brown canvas soft top (why?), new black metallic 17-inch wheels, a new telescoping steering wheel with 42mm of travel (which is actually a big deal for drivers of a certain build), easier-to-open doors, and revised seat levers.
Hold on to your hats America, because Mazda has also revised the cup holders!
The safety gizmos have also gotten in on the act, as the new Miata comes with a standard rearview camera, Traffic Sign Recognition, and Smart City Brake Support. Throughout all of this, the beloved little lightweight sports car has gained just seven lbs. for 2019.
Whatever poundage the extra stuff added, Mazda was able to offset with clever ideas like an aluminum steering shaft replacing the previous steel unit. Mazda calls this the “Gram Strategy.”
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata is available now. The MX-5 Sport starts at $25,730 with a manual transmission; $27,080 with an automatic. The Sport is only available as a soft top, however. The MX-5 Grand Touring, at the top of the range, starts at $31,855 for the soft top; $34,410 for the RF or “retractable fastback.”

2018/06/22,2019 Chevy Blazer: Maybe We Should Blaze The Old Trail Instead?,"I should get something off my chest before I raise my eyebrow. I like Chevrolet  – really General Motors in general – but at heart, I’m a Chevy guy. Sure, Buick is cool and Caddy has their strong points, but my Silverado and Camaro enthusiasm is first. I live in Detroit and the Chevy Fountain is my favorite part about Comerica Park, made even better when one of our beloved Tigers launches a ball over it.
So Chevy is just in my blood.
Changing Tides
I am certain Chevrolet and General Motors (in general) know what they are doing. The have been building cars for a minute and understand the ever changing trends in the market. The 2019 Blazer will go exactly where it’s intended, but that’s a much different place than where the Blazer used to go.
Like through snow drifts and sand dunes.
But times are changing and the markets are evolving. To use a phrase fitting of the Chevy Fountain, it’s a different ballgame today and automakers, if they are to remain successful and profitable, must tune in to such things.
“Chevrolet has been at the forefront of each of the major automotive industry trends by anticipating consumer demand and delivering innovative products like Bolt EV, Colorado, and Trax,” explained Alan Batey, President of GM North America and head of Global Chevrolet. “The introduction of the all-new Blazer builds on that momentum and further strengthens the most comprehensive lineup of crossovers and SUVs on the market today.”
Blazing Trails
With the old K5; its near-immortal engines (350, 400, 6.2 Diesel), heavy-duty suspension, transfer case, and axles, and sheer size, one felt like they could drive over mountains. And yes, with today’s technology and engineering, smaller powertrains can produce more torque with better efficiency; advanced materials make for lighter and stronger components. Overall, today’s vehicles are better in almost every way.
And the 2019 Chevy Blazer is no exception. It’s “better” than the K5 because it benefits from a dose of modernity. But still . . . the K5 was the K5. As a kid, I thought the “K’ stood for King. The 2019 Chevy Blazer might be better, but could it ever best the King? Similar to how a pop star today might benefit from modern recording equipment, but that doesn’t make them Elvis.
The new Blazer lands between the Equinox and Traverse, an odd move considering the return of the Ford Bronco in 2020. Perhaps the Bowtie will challenge the Blue Oval with another offering, but from the onset, it would seem the best (and only) contender against a burly Bronco would be a beastly Blazer.
RELATED

Give it the ZR2 treatment like the Colorado, and Chevy might could send the old Bronco to pasture.
Styling Treatments
Instead, it looks like the 2019 Blazer will roam free on city expressways and through suburban developments, standing as the most prominent expression of Chevrolet’s current crossover design theme. No, it’s not the K5, but the wide stance, tight proportions, higher beltline, and overall sculpting do give it a certain level of muscular flair.
The LED daytime running lamps are a nice touch.
Each individual model will offer a unique look and distinctive styling, meant to fancy the tastes of different customers. Depending on the model, the grille or chrome layout might change, or in the case of the RS, a shaded and blacked-out theme will rule the vehicle. 18-inch aluminum wheels are standard but opt for either the RS or Premier, and 21-inch wheels are on the table.
Interior Treatments
Five passenger seating means the clan can pile in and with wireless charging and six available USB ports, they won’t miss a single right swipe on the trip. Those having already found the right swipe of their dreams can kick out the extra passengers, fold the second row seats down, and take advantage of over 64 cubic feet of cargo space for that romantic getaway.
Don’t read into that. Two lovers on vacation can pack enough to supply an army.
If packing for the trip causes concern, opt for the Blazer’s cargo management system which will help keep everything organized. Once the gear is packed, the drive should be enjoyable with the available heated and ventilated front seats and panoramic sunroof.
The Chevrolet Infotainment 3 system is standard along with 4G LTE WiFi connectivity.
Power & Performance
The 2019 Blazer trades big and bulky for lean and efficient, coming standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that makes 193 horsepower. Drivers will get more juice out of the available 3.6-liter V6, an evergreen GM plant that produces a healthy 305 horsepower and 269 lb-ft. of torque. Both engines are direct-injected, utilize stop/start technology, and come paired to a nine-speed automatic.
With the V6, the 2019 Blazer can tow 4,500 lbs., nice for those weekend trips to the lake. The Hitch Guidance and Hitch View systems should make it easy to attach to a trailer.
Traction Select is standard, allowing drivers to better tailor the Blazer to the conditions at hand. RS and Premier models offer a more sophisticated twin-clutch all-wheel drive system that helps optimize traction, especially on wet or icy roads.

2018/06/22,2019 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid: New Appearance Package Proves Minivans Are Cool,"Who says minivans can’t be cool?! The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will still haul the family, but it’s a bit edgier now with the new S Appearance Package. The addition gives the Pacifica Hybrid a shaded and blacked-out look, a design that is becoming quite popular today. The package is – and has been for awhile – available for the gas Pacifica.
“The factory custom look of the S Appearance model is really resonating with our Pacifica buyers, so much so that we are now making it available on the Pacifica Hybrid model,” explained Steve Beahm, Head of Passenger Car Brands – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and Fiat, FCA – North America.
Styling Treatments
The styling deets have gloss black elements running the length of the exterior: grille surrounds, eyebrow accents on the headlamps, daylight opening moldings, roof rack, and rear valance moldings all see gloss black treatment.
The 18-inch wheels and the Pacifica’s badging come in a “Black Noise” finish.
The S Appearance Package fills the interior with a combination of black and “Light Diesel Gray” accents.
Storied Past
35 years ago, Chrysler changed the automotive landscape with the minivan. Both Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich, fresh off a rejection from Ford Motor Company for a minivan concept, landed at cross town rivals Chrysler. They were the architects of the Mustang, which proved wildly successful for Ford, but the Blue Oval was hesitant to combine the words “mini” and “van” together.
The Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager would later surface, arguably to the bewilderment of not only Ford, but other automakers as well. That first generation paved the way for the Pacifica Hybrid, which provides 566 miles of total range and more than 100 available safety and security features. The cassette tape players of the early minivans are now replaced by the Uconnect 4 system of the Pacifica, complete with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, navigation, and 4G LTE connectivity.
In essence, Chrysler’s minivan has aged well, boasting 115 specific innovations in the segment.
“With 84 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) in electric-only mode and 33 miles of all-electric range, this package makes the industry’s only hybrid minivan even more unique,” Beahm added.
Pricing & Availability
The S Appearance Package for the 2019 Pacifica Hybrid is available for $595.00, and can be ordered as soon as next month. Expect S Appearance-themed Pacifica Hybrids at FCA dealerships this fall.

2018/06/21,2019 BMW 8 Series: Sonny Corleone’s Car Two Decades Later,"Okay y’all, here we go again. BMW is having another run at making a big coupe. For reasons that are beyond me, the Bavarian company seems to have a hard time getting things just right in this arena. As a matter of fact, they haven’t even tried to take a crack at this for 20 years.
It was 20 years ago that BMW gave up on trying to make their last big coupe, coincidentally also an 8 Series, work financially. The last 8 Series coupe was a serious car. It wasn’t a sports car, it was too big and heavy to be considered that, but what it did have was still impressive: Lots of technology and a big, whopping V12 engine.
It was what a German Architect would drive: Stylish, exclusive, powerful, expensive. But for some reason, BMW could never seem to sell those things. The only people who likeed them were NBA players (they were incredibly roomy), but NBA players are a pretty small market, so BMW finally stopped.
Honest & Handsome
Fast forward to today, and BMW wants another try. Ever since the passing of the glorious 3.0 CS, 3.0 CSi, and the sublime 3.0 CSL, BMW has been wanting a coupe that says, “See! You best take us seriously buddy.” And with the all-new 2019 8 Series Coupe, they might just have an answer in the affirmative.
The 2019 BMW 8 Series Coupe will never be called a beautiful car; brutally handsome fits better. The production version looks a lot like the show car that debuted at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este in 2017. BMW says the styling focuses on modernity and emotional engagement. I say it’s sort of the automotive equivalent of Sonny Corleone; more purposeful than beautiful, stronger, rather than graceful. It’s not a scalpel, it’s a cleaver, and a very sharp one at that.
The styling is all low-slung and elongated silhouettes, slim window pillars and “double-bubble” contouring, long wheelbase, and wide track.
Power & Performance
All this „Geh mir aus dem Weg, ich bin ein Ruck mit viel Geld“ style gets moving thanks to a new aluminum alloy, TwinPower Turbo V8 engine; a 4.4-liter mill with two twin-scroll turbochargers with charge air cooling located within the cylinder’s V. It’s managed by High Precision Injection, VALVETRONIC fully variable valve control, and Double-VANOS variable camshaft timing. The engine’s note is described as “enthralling” (for what that’s worth) and the entire package is further regulated by a Driving Experience Control switch that can tweak stuff like accelerator response, comfort versus performance, power delivery, and acoustics.
RELATED
2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD: Dashing Through The Snow
Bottom line for the new V8 engine: 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft. of torque.
Driveline Magic
After the engine comes an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission with wider ratios and quicker gear shifts. Weight has been reduced, gear shifts are sharper, rotational forces are reduced, and the whole deal is controlled via a bunch of computers between your fingertips on the shift paddles and the transmission.
And yes, the 2019 BMW 8 Series will be all-wheel drive. Currently, no other option exists. BMW says the xDrive system has been improved and comes with an electronically-controlled differential lock. Thankfully, BMW says all of the drive torque is directed to the rear wheels in situations when all-wheel drive is not needed. The system’s rear-biased setup promises a driving experience above and beyond the luxuries this car carries.
All this adds up to the new 2019 BMW M850i xDrive doing zero to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, topping out at a limited 155 mph (boo!).
Suspension & Braking
The suspension for the new 8 is a double-wishbone front axle and a five-link rear design. An electro-mechanical steering box points the front end, which is held up by torsion struts, while the rear axle rides on independent rubber bearings to increase camber stiffness and enhance the suspension’s baseline setup.
Also standard is an Adaptive M suspension with electronically-controlled dampers; both compression and rebound are adjusted continuously and independently. Yes, like the engine and trans, the suspension is also controlled and adjusted via the Driving Experience Control switch.
Braking? C’mon man, this is a BMW, it’s got brakes that could stop a train. The 8 Series Coupe is whoa’ed up with four-piston, fixed-caliper brakes at the front and single-piston, floating-caliper brakes at the rear. There’s an electronic parking brake (boo!) and the DSC stability control is fully integrated into the braking system.
Pricing & Availability
The new coupe will be built at the BMW Dingolfing plant in Germany. When it arrives in showrooms this December, the 2019 M850i xDrive Coupe will start at $111,900 plus $995 for destination and handling.

2018/06/21,2019 Genesis G70: Korea Goes Head-to-Head with Germany,"Many people say the sport sedan is dead but Hyundai’s luxury subsidiary Genesis thinks otherwise. The 2019 Genesis G70 is the third and final sedan in the Genesis lineup, yet the third of six brand new models that are slated to debut by 2021.
But unlike the flagship G90 and midsize G80, the 2019 Genesis G70 is bred and engineered to deliver a sportier and more athletic driving feel. I found this interesting since the 2019 Genesis G70 has a longer wheelbase (111.6-inches) than the BMW 3-Series, Audi A4, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
Overall length is also on the larger end of the scale compared to the German marquees at 184.5-inches. This tells me the 2019 Genesis G70 will offer driver-focused performance without ruffling your tail feathers.
The Proof is in the Pudding
The new Genesis G70 was engineered by design and is equipped with the stiffest body structures in its class, according to the automaker.
“The foundation for any kind of car that performs well dynamically is an incredibly rigid platform,” said Albert Biermann, President and Head of Vehicle Performance, Hyundai Motor Group. “That translates not only to performance, but how it feels down the road as well as safety achievement levels.”
The strategic use of aluminum for the hood and strut tower reinforcement bars enables the G70 to have a lower center of gravity. The car also benefits from an integrated frame that drastically reduces the number of physical parts needed to reinforce the chassis.
“The proof is in how G70 handles on a spirited drive, whether that’s early on a Sunday morning on a hilly, country road or on a daily commute to the office,” Biermann continued. “We used high-strength steel, aerospace-grade adhesives, and strategic lightening with aluminum to create the ideal balance of stiffness and competitiveness.”
The result of all this is telepathic steering, sportier handling, and better driving dynamics. The rigid body structure and longer wheelbase also equates to a smoother ride.
Exterior Design
Genesis designed the 2019 G70 under the company’s Athletic Elegance ethos. The new saloon has the widest overall stance and lowest overall height in the segment. The kinetic form factor of the exterior panels was enough to return a sleek and aerodynamic 0.28 coefficient of drag. If you slap on the more aggressive 19-inch wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires, the coefficient of drag is still a slippery 0.29.
So far, it seems Genesis created a recipe for a truly scintillating dish. Stiff and rigid chassis? Check. Aerodynamic body design? Check. So, what’s next?

Power to the People
The 2019 Genesis G70 can be configured with a 2.0-liter turbocharged and direct-injected 4-cylinder gasoline motor with 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque. This engine benefits from a smaller turbine wheel, motor-driven intake variable valve timing system, and a two-stage relief oil pump to improve low end torque and engine power.
The crème of the crop is the 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged and direct-injected V6 motor that churns out 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft. of torque. Curiously enough, both motors can be found in the Kia Stinger. The V6 motor is equipped with a single scroll, twin turbo system, integrated exhaust manifold cylinder head, a dual-stage variable oil pump, and the Mid Position Lock Continuously Variable Valve Train system (MPL CVVT) to improve engine response and efficiency.
Transmission Tech
Transferring power to the rear wheels is the standard eight-speed automatic with rev-matching and gear-holding technology. All-wheel drive is an option for either engine. A mechanical limited-slip differential is standard on the 3.3 (rear-wheel drive) and optional on the 2.0 (also rear-wheel drive).
What’s interesting is the availability of a six-speed manual transmission on the 2.0 turbo, rear-wheel drive. If you choose the manual, your G70 will also come with high-performance Brembo brakes, higher horsepower output (255 versus 252 for the automatic variant), a special exhaust, and additional weight reduction features.
Other go-fast and performance-enhancing goodies include launch control, a rack-mounted and motor-driven power steering system, and Dynamic Torque Vectoring Control so you can attack corners like Mika Hakkinen on steroids.
Availability
What we have here is an exciting and equally luxurious sports saloon that will give the Alfa Romeo Giulia, BMW 3-Series, and Audi A4 a serious run for the money. You can expect the 2019 Genesis G70 to arrive at U.S. dealerships this summer.

2018/06/21,"GM Breaks Ground On New Parts Processing Facility In Burton, Michigan","General Motors Customer Care and Aftersales recently broke ground on a new ACDelco and Genuine GM Parts processing center in Burton, Michigan. The site, a vacant 141-acre lot near the intersections of Genesee and Davison roads in the City of Burton, is GM’s single largest investment in a warehousing and logistics facility in the United States in nearly 40 years.
The processing center will see a $65 million investment from the automaker.
Forward Looking
When it opens early next year, the facility will serve as the main induction point in the United States for ACDelco and Genuine GM service parts. Once there, the parts will be unitized and packaged, ultimately ending up in service departments and dealerships around the country for use on a variety of GM and other vehicles.
The Burton facility will also mirror many of the objectives proposed in GM’s most recent sustainability report.
“GM is executing a focused and disciplined strategy to improve our core business and position the company for the future, guided by our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion,” explained Tim Turvey, GM Global Vice President, Customer Care and Aftersales. “Our new facility in Burton will help us deliver that future.”
Upward Expansion
At over a million square feet of floor space, the facility will be more than double the size of the GM’s existing parts processing center. Once completed, it will have 84 shipping and receiving docks, up from 35 at the current facility. Close to 700 hourly and salaried team members will make up the staff. After the closure of the existing center on Davison Road in Burton, employees will transfer to the new location.
NorthPoint Development will build the facility and lease it to GM for an initial term of 12.5 years.
“Projects like this only become a reality when you have great teamwork and true collaboration, like we have with the City of Burton, the UAW, and NorthPoint Development,” Turvey said.

2018/06/21,"Volvo Inaugurates First U.S. Manufacturing Plant, Doubles Down On Environmental Initiatives","Volvo has inaugurated their first manufacturing plant in the United States, a new state-of-the-art production facility in Charleston, South Carolina. The plant is central for Volvo’s “Build Where You Sell” strategy, establishing a manufacturing presence in all three of the company’s major sales regions. Volvo says the new South Carolina facility nicely compliments the company’s three European plants – two manufacturing, one engine – plus three factories and an engine plant in China, and assembly plants in India and Malaysia.
“The opening of our first American factory is a very big deal,” said Anders Gustafsson, President and CEO, Volvo Car USA. “Our U.S. business is developing well, our cars have won prestigious awards, and the new South Carolina facility will be a big asset to both Volvo Cars and the community.”
Home Team
Volvo Cars is investing over a billion dollars in the South Carolina plant to create 4,000 new jobs during the coming years. The site includes an office building for up to 300 staff from R&D, purchasing, quality, and sales. Approximately 1,500 will be employed by the end of this year, just as production of the new S60 is beginning. The plant can produce 150,000 cars per year at full capacity.
“The Charleston plant establishes the U.S. as our third home market,” said Håkan Samuelsson, President and Chief Executive, Volvo Cars. “The sedan segment and the SPA platform’s proven ability to boost profitability offer significant growth opportunities for Volvo Cars in the U.S. and globally.”
Environmental Focus
Volvo also wants at least 25 percent of the plastic used in every new model to come via recycled material from 2025 onward. Volvo has already unveiled a specially-built version of the XC60 T8 plug-in hybrid that looks identical to the current model, but has several of its plastic components replaced with recycled materials.
The vehicle’s interior has a tunnel console made from renewable fibres, plastics from discarded fishing nets, and maritime ropes. The carpet contains fibers made from PET plastic bottles and a recycled cotton mix from clothing manufacturers’ off-cuts. The seats also use PET fibers from plastic bottles; seats from old Volvo cars were even re-purposed for sound-absorbing material.
“Environmental care is one of Volvo’s core values and we will continue to find new ways to bring this into our business,” Samuelsson said. “This car and our recycled plastics ambition are further examples of that commitment.”
Collaborative Effort
Volvo is urging suppliers to work closely with automakers to develop a more sustainable approach to manufacturing.

“We already work with some great, forward-thinking suppliers when it comes to sustainability,” explained Martina Buchhauser, Senior Vice President of Global Procurement, Volvo Cars. “However, we do need increased availability of recycled plastics if we are to make our ambition a reality.”
Volvo is also pushing for climate-neutral operations by 2025, and in January, the engine plant in Skövde, Sweden became the company’s first such facility.
“That is why we call on even more suppliers and new partners to join us in investing in recycled plastics and to help us realize our ambition,” Buchhauser added.

2018/06/20,"AutoSens Returns To Brussels, Belgium With Robust Agenda Focused On Autonomous Driving","Fresh off a successful Detroit conference in May, AutoSens, a global summit on automated driving, is returning to Brussels, Belgium in September. Organizers have announced the agenda for the event which includes over 60 different sessions meant to facilitate meaningful dialogue on the topic of autonomous cars.
“The challenge of the automotive industry is to design computers and robots that can perform tasks better than humans can, while also causing minimal disruption to a system that will include human driven vehicles for many decades to come,” explained AutoSens founder Robert Stead. “It’s no easy task.”
Collaboration & Communication
AutoSens covers nearly every aspect of autonomous driving, from the supply chain, infrastructure, and engineering challenges, to legal, financial, and ethical considerations. Attendees, speakers, sponsors, and participants are encouraged to leverage each other’s expertise during the event, which takes aim at the biggest challenges facing autonomous cars. Collaboration and creativity are the central themes of AutoSens, whereby professionals in the field are encouraged to share ideas and devise solutions to the obstacles facing autonomous driving.
“This is a fiercely competitive market, but all companies can benefit from a forum with a free exchange of ideas,” Stead told us earlier this year. “Of course people don’t come and give away all their trade secrets, but so often engineers across the supply chain are facing similar challenges, and by working together to solve some of those core problems, they can spend more time focusing on the real value-add IP at the cutting edge of research.”
“I would say the biggest challenge for people is trying to understand the different technologies,” said Phil Magney, Founder and Principal Advisor, VSI Labs, during AutoSens Detroit in May. “This conference has been good for us because we meet like-minded people that are facing similar challenges; we talk, we exchange our views, and we learn from each other.”
For Engineers, By Engineers
Organizers say they are focused on the technical integrity of the conference, making sure attendees have an accurate picture of what is going on the market. In other words, there are no sales pitches or slides; “for engineers, by engineers” is the approach organizers take, and it can be seen in every aspect of the conference, from the autonomous vehicle demonstrations, to the expert panel of speakers.
“AutoSens brings together engineering minds in a way incomparable with other events this this sector,” Stead said. “A real sense of community is what makes it tick. You’ll find the attendees, even if they are doing research on a niche technical area, will be very open to explain what it’s all about to those who are not so experienced.”

2018/06/20,First 2019 Subaru Ascent Hits The Road,"The very first 2019 Subaru Ascent has hit the road, being sold by Sommer’s Subaru in Mequon, Wisconsin to Samantha Ernest of Pewaukee, Wisconsin. To mark the occasion, the retailer held a small celebration for Ernest who was joined by her two sons Caden and Oliver, and their Boston Terrier, Brewer.
Production of the three-row SUV began in early May.
Personal Greeting
Subaru of America’s District Sales Manager, Mark Schreiber, was on hand with with dealer principals Don and Wally Sommer. Sommer’s Subaru opened in 1997 and remains a family operation today; Wally’s son, Grant, and Don’s daughter, Elizabeth, are employees. All greeted Ernest personally when she arrived to take delivery.
“Samantha is a two-time Subaru owner,” Don Sommer said. “She bought her first Subaru from me in 2006, and in 2008 she bought a Tribeca. She’s been patiently waiting for the Ascent, and following it for a year-and-a-half.”
Ernest was presented with the Starlink Entertainment Anywhere kit that includes two 9.7-inch Apple iPads, two Harman Kardon Bluetooth headphones, and two OtterBox cases. The 2019 Ascent is also the first Subaru to have a dedicated, in-vehicle WiFi hotspot.
Like many Americans, however, Ernest simply needed more room to accommodate her growing family.
“My husband, Pat Henderson, and I have two active little boys,” she said. “They love sports, so we’re always running them to Taekwondo, swimming or team sports with their friends.”
Family Friendly
Subaru’s engineers were tasked with maximizing the vehicle’s available space, creating flexible seating options, and enhancing the overall interior comfort. The 2019 Ascent is now the largest Subaru ever built and comes with a third row, arguably the vehicle’s best feature.
“One of the reasons I wanted this new SUV is because it has the third row,” Ernest said, referencing her sons and their active lifestyle. “Now that they’re getting a bit older and have more friends, I need more room.”
Other family-oriented features include rear doors that open 75 degrees, making access to the third-row seats easier. The vehicle is powered by a 2.4-liter Boxer engine that creates 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft. of torque. All-wheel drive is standard.
Pricing & Availability
  The 2019 Subaru Ascent is priced from $31,995 and is available now in four trim levels: Base, Premium, Limited, and Touring. Subaru’s Lafayette, Indiana plant is responsible for the SUV’s production, which resulted in 200 new jobs and $140 million in equipment and expansion investments. The plant already produces the Outback, Legacy, and Impreza.

2018/06/19,"Ford Invests In Future Technology, Local Neighborhoods With Purchase of Iconic Detroit Landmark","Ford Motor Company announced the acquisition of Michigan Central Station during a ceremony attended by employees, residents, city and state officials, and members of the media. Michigan Central Station, located in Detroit’s Corktown neighborhood, will serve as a hub for autonomous and electric vehicle design, as well as the development of urban mobility services, including – but not limited to – connected vehicles, infrastructure, and public transit.
The announcement comes as the automaker celebrates its 115-year anniversary.
“Michigan Central Station is a place that in many ways tells the story of Detroit over the past century,” said Bill Ford, Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company. “We at Ford want to help write the next chapter, working together in Corktown with the best startups, the smartest talent, and the thinkers, engineers, and problem-solvers who see things differently – all to shape the future of mobility and transportation.”
Brief History
Michigan Central Station has been a fixture of Detroit for generations, finished in January of 1914 as the depot for the Michigan Central Railroad. At the time, the Michigan Central Railroad bought 50 acres of land in Corktown after the downtown depot at Third and Jefferson could no longer sustain the influx of passengers.
Michigan Central Station became the new designation, headed by the same architects that designed New York’s Grand Central Station. When it was constructed, it stood 13 stories high with a roof height of 230 feet, enough to make it the world’s tallest train station
The first train left for Saginaw and Bay City on December 26th, 1913 as the first arrival came from Chicago. In its prime, the depot served some 4,000 people daily. Among the many notable guests: Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 and Harry S. Truman in 1948. The park in front of the station was eventually named Roosevelt Park, in honor of Theodore Roosevelt who visited in 1916.
Michigan Central Station remained in service until January 6th 1988, slowly falling into ruin after Amtrak departed the station for the final time. On numerous occasions, the question was raised of who would be able to restore it. Dozens of suggestions, from luxury apartments to a police headquarters were proposed, all to no avail. For years, the iconic train station had plenty of interest, and certinately plenty of potential, but no suitor could be found.
Upward Expansion
The purchase of Michigan Central Station is one of several in the Corktown area for Ford. The automaker has also acquired the former Detroit Public Schools Book Depository, the site of an old brass factory, a refurbished former factory, and two acres of empty land. In time, Ford’s Corktown campus will consist of 1.2 million square feet of space, three-quarters of which will be split between the company and its partners.

Another 300,000 square feet will combine community areas, retail space, and residential housing.
Approximately 2,500 Ford employees, many from the mobility team, will be based in Corktown by 2022, with space by that time to accommodate another 2,500 employees of the automaker and/or other partners. Ford believes being situated in Detroit proper will help attract an array of talent, from promising startups to experienced engineers who want to tackle the biggest challenges facing mobility.
Challenges & Opportunities
Michigan Central Station will be home to some of Ford’s most ambitious and forward-looking objectives. For example, the Corktown campus will facilitate the implementation of what Ford calls a “fresh approach” on how transportation can help citizens lead more productive and fulfilled lives.
“What Rouge was to Ford in the industrial age, Corktown can be for Ford in the information age,” explained Jim Hackett, President and CEO, Ford Motor Company. “It will be the proving ground where Ford and our partners design and test the services and solutions for the way people are going to live and get around tomorrow, creating a Southeast Michigan mobility corridor that spans west from Dearborn to Ann Arbor, and east to Detroit.”
The automaker notes that as cities become more populated, as infrastructure ages, and as new technologies become available, the way people get around will inevitably be impacted. To truly address this, Ford believes it will take more than just new vehicles – or even autonomous ones – but rather smart automobiles that can adapt and react to an increasingly connected world.
“This will be the kind of campus where the emerging economy thrives – a collaborative ecosystem of companies, educators, investors, and innovators,” Hackett continued. “This is where part of our team will live and work as a part of this community, alongside the customers and neighbors whose lives we’re trying to make better.”
“In Corktown, Ford’s efforts can come together in an urban environment, proving-out technology in the same environment where new ideas must be applied,” reads a statement from the automaker. “This campus has the potential to help return Detroit to being the ‘mobility capital of the world’ – shaping the future of transportation for the better.”
Community Service
It was Ford’s Highland Park and River Rouge plants that helped put the nation on wheels and create the middle class. At Willow Run, the War Effort saw the assembly of the planes and tanks that stopped an evil dictator during World War II. In Flat Rock, the Mustang continues to inspire a generation of enthusiasts, while in Kentucky, the big trucks that roll off the line serve as chariots for the working population.

It remains the automaker’s vision that Corktown becomes a similar staple in their history.
“Just as Dearborn does, Corktown holds a special place in my heart,” Ford said. “Henry Ford was the son of an immigrant. His father, William Ford, came over from Cork during Ireland’s potato famine. And Corktown was a destination for immigrants like him who came here with little more than hope.”
Under the company’s ownership, Michigan Central Station will see a complete restoration to its original luster, along with the addition of local shops, restaurants, and dedicated public spaces for area residents. The new Michigan Central Station will strike a balance, serving as a centerpiece for future innovation and standing as a monument to Detroit’s rich history.
“It was a place where you could reimagine what’s possible,” Ford said. “That’s what we want to do all over again, right here in Corktown – to build tomorrow, together.”

2018/06/16,Volvo Cars Tech Fund Makes First Investment In Start-Up Automotive Sensor Company,"The Volvo Cars Tech Fund has completed their first strategic investment, taking a stake in a start-up company called Luminar. Based in Palo Alto, California, and Orlando, Florida, Luminar’s expertise in sensor and LiDAR technology will help bolster Vovlo’s commitment to manufacturing a safe and viable autonomous car.
“LiDAR is a key technology for enabling autonomous cars to navigate safely in complex traffic environments and at higher speeds,” explained Henrik Green, Senior Vice President, Research and Development, Volvo Cars.
Market Position
Launched earlier this year, the Volvo Cars Tech Fund focuses on state-of-the-art trends like artificial intelligence, electrification, autonomous driving, and digital mobility services. Investments, mergers, and acquisitions in this sector are growing. During AutoSens Brussels last September, Rudy Burger, Managing Partner, Woodside Capital Partners, spoke on how such developments within the automotive arena impact future mobility.
“What we are seeing is a number of very large companies placing bets – significant bets – whereby they believe in order to create a controlling position in the market, they must actually acquire a company,” he said during his presentation.
“Luminar represents exactly the type of company and technology we seek to invest in, providing us with strategic access to new technologies, capabilities, and talent,” said Zaki Fasihuddin, CEO of the Tech Fund. “Supporting promising young firms that are at the forefront of technological development will help us introduce cutting-edge technology that strengthens our leading role in the industry.”
Mutual Benefits
Start-up companies, like Luminar, benefit by being able to leverage Volvo’s network of automotive and technology partners, while more effectively validating their own innovations and streamlining the process of getting them to market.
“Volvo is at the forefront of autonomous vehicle development, and their safety-centric approach to autonomy is directly aligned with our sensing capabilities,” said Austin Russell, Luminar Founder and CEO. “Our LiDAR is the first to deliver the necessary performance to enable safe and reliable long-range perception, which is required to unlock their goals of autonomy at highway speeds.”
“Our collaboration with Luminar allows us to learn more about its promising technologies and takes Volvo Cars one step further to the highly autonomous cars of the future,” Green added.

2018/06/15,Look Out Buddy! The Upgraded 2019 Mustang Shelby GT350 Is Coming,"Every so often Ford gets the Mustang just right, and when they do, I generally like them. I’m not part of the cult though. I think there have been downright terrible Mustangs in the past, and I think the continued beatification of Carroll Shelby is annoying and misplaced, but with that said, the 2019 Mustang Shelby GT350 sure looks like it’ll impress.
Ford is right up front with how they made the upcoming GT350 better: “. . . Ford Performance leveraged its Mustang road course racing programs . . .” These words are music to a track hound such as myself.
See, racing does improve the breed (a pun in the case of a car named after a horse). So what makes the 2019 GT350 so good?
Beds Are Burning
For starters, FoMoCo burned the midnight oil with Michelin so they could burn the rubber more effectively. New Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires were engineered with a Shelby GT350-specific tread pattern and compound for more grip, and considerably enhanced acceleration, lateral grip, and braking.
The boss meats are 295/35 up front and 305/35 at back and fitted to 19-inch aluminum wheels.
Ford also worked the aero with a new rear spoiler, optional Gurney flap (buy it), and an adjusted grille closeout based off the upcoming Shelby GT500. Ford also upgraded the Mustang Shelby GT350’s standard MagneRide active suspension to harmonize the aero and tire developments, along with re-calibrating the springs and revising the damping.
Power & Performance
The Shelby GT350 is propelled down Woodward with an exclusive, high-revving 5.2-liter V8, delivering 526 horsepower and 429 lb-ft. o’torque. It revs all the way up to an 8,250-rpm redline, making said mill the most powerful naturally-aspirated Ford production engine ever. Naturally, the 5.2 8-banger is mated to a track-proven Tremec 6-speed manual transmission.
Wanna stop? You will, and in no short order, thanks to six-piston front and four-piston rear caliper Brembo brakes. The Shelby GT350’s steering is an electric power-assist deal, and there are three different modes for the electronic stability control.
Interior Treatments
On the inside, you lucky drivers are indulged with a comfortable and trendy cockpit featuring the latest in advanced technology and premium materials. There’s a standard machined aluminum instrument panel appliqué or an available exposed carbon fiber option. The door panel inserts are newly designed in dark slate Miko suede with accent stitching (no, I don’t know what or who Miko is either).
The seats are standard Recaro racing bits with open pass-throughs for safety harnesses.
Soundtrack? For me, that comes from that 5.2-liter plant, but for those that like to listen to music, the 2019 Mustang Shelby GT350 comes with a new, custom-tuned 12-speaker B&O PLAY audio system by HARMAN, controlled via the standard eight-inch SYNC 3 touchscreen. Dual-zone temperature control is now standard so your passenger can shut up about being too hot or too cold, and Ford even threw in a universal garage door opener.

Exterior Colors
The 2019 Mustang Shelby GT350 gets new colors including Velocity Blue and Ford Performance Blue. There are optional factory-painted racing stripes available in high-gloss Shadow Black, Oxford White or Kona Blue, to which I can only say “Screw the cops, I’m buying the stripe package!!”
There are also these strange mirror-mounted Shelby Cobra Projection Lamps in the available Technology Package.
Availability
The new Mustang Shelby GT350 will be available starting in the far off days of early 2019 (too far away!). And not only do you get the car, but you are also enrolled in an exclusive, complimentary Track Attack driving program from Ford Performance. How nice of them.

2018/06/14,Brabham Automotive Reveals BT62 Signature Series Livery,"Alright all you well-heeled track rats, speed freaks, gearheads, and various assorted mechanical reprobates with (lots of) money. Brabham Automotive has announced all of the livery and color options for their soon-to-be-released BT62, and if this thing is as fast as it is pretty, I foresee lots of non-owners jealousy sulking in the paddock in the near future.
There will be two broad categories of paintwork to choose from: The Celebration series and the Signature series. The BT62 will soon be out with a base price of £1m (about $1.3 million in real money, pilgrim).
Further, production of the Brabham BT62 will be limited to just 70 cars in recognition of Brabham’s 70-year heritage, so get your finances in order and get in line now.
Here’s what your palette could look like.
Celebration Series
The Celebration Series will make up half of the production run, all 35 of them paying tribute to Brabham’s 35 Grand Prix victories over its 30-year reign in Formula 1. Clever of them, no? Each car in the Celebration Series is presented in honor of a specific race win, wearing the colors and race number of the winning car. Which, I’ve got to say is a completely cool move.
Chassis number one of those 70, BT62/01 (pro tip: pay attention to chassis numbers; at this stratosphere of automotive excellence, the chassis number is how you keep track of who’s who), celebrates Brabham’s first-ever Formula 1 Grand Prix victory at Rouen-Les-Essarts on June 26th 1964, won by Dan Gurney in the Brabham BT7.
Which, couple of things here: One – Rouen-Les-Essarts was a crazy dangerous track built inside an extinct volcano; Two – Dan won? I could have sworn that Jack Brabham won the first race for his cars, but I guess it was big Dan; Three – Did you know that Dan Gurney was also the first guy to give Porsche its first F1 win?
Classic & Controversial
Anyhoo, BT62/01 wears the iconic Australian green and gold racing colors from that BT7, and proudly sports race number 11 from Gurney’s winning car; and green and gold is a lovely color combination. The wing end plate features a detailed outline of the BT7 from which its livery takes its cues, along with the corresponding race date, circuit, and flag of the host country. saWEET!
Chassis BT62/03, the debut car revealed in London, celebrates Brabham’s third Grand Prix victory: Jack Brabham’s 1966 win at Reims in the BT19, becoming the first driver to win a Formula 1 Championship race in a car of his own construction.
RELATED
Mustang Lithium Has a Beast Mode & Tons of Power!
And they are not about to shy away from any of those well-earned victories, no matter how controversial. Chassis BT62/19, for example, is all red and blue like the BT46B “fan car” that Niki drove to its only race win at Anderstorp, Sweden before being promptly banned for one of the most creative cheats ever devised.
Seriously man, that entire BT46B deal is a story unto itself.
Exclusive Treatments
It’s not just the outside that gets the winning treatment, the inside pays homage as well. A commemorative plaque is mounted on the dash of each Celebration Series car. The FIA-approved carbon fiber seat shell matches the exterior (another nice touch), while the Alcantara interior trim is finished with contrast stitching (ditto).
Signature Series
If that’s not you, if you want something that says “YOU!!” in big bold letters, then the Signature Series will provide you with your opportunity. You get to work with Brabham’s in-house designers to plot out a unique and individual car. For example, the BT62 that was unveiled recently in Adelaide, South Australia showed a new race-inspired livery of white and green with bold orange accents. That car rode on optional race wheels finished in silver.
Other options available to BT62 owners are a full-visual carbon fiber pack, an additional carbon fiber seat shell to accommodate a passenger (if one must), as well as the ability to configure the track-only (sniff) racer as left or right-hand drive. Brabham is working with Microsoft’s mixed-reality technology to allow owners to configure, customize, and visualize their BT62 without having to see it in the flesh.
Perfect Storm
If this is anything like the racers Jack made in the past, this is going to be one serious car to covet. There are only two things standing in my way: a license plate and 1.3 million bucks. Sigh.

2018/06/13,2018 Fiat 500X Adventurer Edition: A Brief Walk Around,"The Italian-inspired Fiat brand certainly knows how to stand out from the crowd. Those looking for a completely new driving experience should jump behind the wheel of a Fiat – their vehicles, despite being small, are huge on personality.
Adding to that personality is the new Fiat 500X Adventurer Edition, which gives fans of the lovable Italian namesake another way to express themselves. The Adventurer Edition joins the Blue Sky Edition, announced earlier this year.
Black & Orange
The Adventurer Edition, based on the Trekking model, adds 18-inch aluminum wheels, black roof rails, and lots of orange: the mirror caps, body-side graphics, cross bows, and front and rear splash guards are all orange. The molded rear cargo tray and all-weather mats are nice touches for the inside.
“The new Adventurer package offers rugged, adventurous styling and yet another opportunity for customers to personalize their Fiat 500X,” said Steve Beahm, Head of Passenger Car Brands – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and FIAT, FCA – North America.
Thoughtful Engineering
While the styling is a major draw for Fiat enthusiasts, engineers are precise about how the 500X is constructed. The engineering teams carefully design each of the vehicle’s systems and components to return a solid balance of performance, safety, and fuel efficiency.
The 500X is the first Fiat available with all-wheel drive, giving it a distinct advantage in harsh weather versus its other stablemates. Further, all 500X models include a Dynamic Selector system, which allows drivers to alter the vehicle’s performance based on the conditions ahead. Over 70 advanced safety systems are also available.
Power & Performance
The 1.4-liter MultiAir Turbo, standard on the Fiat 500X Pop, creates 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft. of torque. It’s inexpensive to own and fun to drive with its six-speed manual transmission. The 2.4-liter Tigershark I-4 engine with MultiAir2 allows for a bit more when linked up to its nine-speed automatic: 180 horsepower and 175 lb-ft. of torque.
The larger Tigershark engine is standard on the Trekking and Lounge but available on the Pop. We would recommend optioning any 500X with this engine, the Adventurer Edition included.
All-wheel drive models receive a special rear axle that “disconnects” when all-wheel drive is not needed to increase efficiency.
Technology & Connectivity
Yes, plenty of both for the Adventurer Edition. Drivers are treated to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, navigation, Bluetooth capability, and voice commands. To maximize the jams via streaming audio or SiriusXM, an available BeatsAudio system includes eight speakers and a subwoofer.
Fiat runs the Uconnect 4 system with a seven-inch touchscreen. For 2018, improvements include quicker startup times, enhanced processing power, higher resolution, and sharper graphics.

Pricing & Availability
The 2018 Fiat 500X Adventurer Edition comes in four colors: Bianco Gelato (White Clear Coat), Nero Cinema (Black Clear Coat), Grigio Graphite (Graphite Grey), and Grigio Argentino (Grey Metallic). Interior colors include black or brown.
The Adventurer Edition is available for $945 on either front-wheel or all-wheel-drive models, which start at $23,685 and $25,585 respectively, excluding destination.
Expect the 2018 Fiat 500X Adventurer Edition on the market later this summer.

2018/06/13,Ford & Pittsburgh Launch “City of Tomorrow Challenge” To Enhance Mobility,"Pittsburgh, City of Tomorrow! Pittsburgh, city of jet packs and pneumatic tube delivery systems! Pittsburgh, city of efficiency! Pittsburgh, city . . . city . . . okay, right, Pittsburgh is partnering with Ford to work on one of those old urban city center bug-a-boos: efficient transportation.
Makes sense, in a way. Why not give some experimental solutions a go?
The Concept
It’s called “Pittsburgh City of Tomorrow Challenge” and it’s a collaboration with Ford Motor Company, the city of Pittsburgh itself, Dell Technologies, Microsoft, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, and public stakeholders. The aim is to build a crowdsourcing platform for residents, businesses, and community groups that allows for input on and implementation of pilot solutions that improve mobility within Pittsburgh.
The Pittsburgh of tomorrow will be very different from the Pittsburgh of the past, that goes without saying, but in case you like facts to back up observations, you can also take into account that a United Nations report on world urbanization found that 66 percent of the world’s population will live in cities by 2050.
So, as urban populations expand and new technologies present themselves, it would behoove us to seriously look at the way people move around cities. And if Pittsburgh has anything to say about it, it will be green, accessible, sustainable, and built around the needs of the people.
Collaborative Approach
The City of Tomorrow is Ford’s vision for the future that seeks to understand the needs of a given population, and make continuous efforts to implement things that address transportation questions: are there more efficient ways to use bridges, how can we enable people to get to work or spend more time connecting with friends and family, those sort of questions. And rather than taking a top-down approach, Ford has connected with individual communities around the mobility issues those communities care about most.
This collaboration with Pittsburgh pairs Ford’s technology expertise and its partners with the real-world experience and the stories of Pittsburgh and its residents. This creates an opportunity to propose ideas for how data, design, and technology could be put to use to adequately address the city’s future needs.
The City of Tomorrow is an eight-month program involving residents, businesses, and community organizations, each sharing how they experience transportation in Pittsburgh, and how the current transportation available either enables them or functions as an obstacle in their daily lives. And it’s not just moving people around town. Pittsburgh city officials are also looking for ideas that enhance intracity mobility in a number of ways, such as improving access to travel information, building confidence in existing systems, and soliciting ideas for improvements to already established services.

Those interested can go to the Challenge website where they can share their experiences, sign up for community working sessions, and offer insight into the variety of ways people currently move around Pittsburgh. On top of that, Pittsburgh city staff will be out at local neighborhood festivities and events to engage with residents directly.
Participants can submit ideas for accessible solutions starting on July 2nd.
In September, semi-finalists will be selected to attend prototyping sessions, as well as receive mentoring support to further refine their ideas before submitting a final pilot proposal. In the Challenge’s finishing stage, $100,000 will be awarded to selected pilot plans in an effort to test the proposed strategy in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, Ford, and other corporate partners.
The Miami-Dade City of Tomorrow Challenge is also underway with the same initiatives as the Pittsburgh program.
Future Considerations
Will it work? Well, in one way, Pittsburgh is a great place to test this sort of thing: It’s old, a lot of the streets were designed way before cars, there’s public transportation already in place, and the infrastructure and its funding has been neglected since Ronald Reagan was president.
It’s not a worst case scenario, but it is a pretty bad scenario, and that should show what solutions work best in pretty short order and in pretty stark contrast. It might not “work” but it should render a ton of valuable information.

2018/06/12,Even More (Yellow) Individual Flair: 2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S Edition 1,"At least Mercedes doesn’t call it a four-door sports car, but even so, calling it a four-door coupe is almost bad enough. Coupes have two doors. Sedans have four doors. The Mercedes AMG GT 4-Door has, unsurprisingly, four doors.
It’s a sedan. But a very good sedan.
First Edition
Fundamentally, the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe has the basic underpinnings of the “normal” AMG GT Coupe. And since the AMG GT Coupe is pretty much a beast, then it’s not much of a stretch to see how the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe should also be as well.
And just to make you feel all special about not just purchasing an AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, but buying one of the first ones to show up, Merc has upped the ante (slightly) with a unique Edition 1 model with a bunch of exclusive interior and exterior bits for 2019.
Basically, early adopters get an AMG Aerodynamics Package, special wheels and paint, AMG Performance seats and steering wheel, and Matte Carbon-Fiber trim.
Aerodynamic Art
About that trick areo package. The AMG Aerodynamics Package for the Edition 1 comes with a larger front splitter and integrated aero flics in the front bumper. The diffuser has been “optimized” and the rear spoiler’s angle can be mechanically adjusted. The rear spoiler and larger front splitter, combined with the AIRPANEL active air management system, gets you a noticeable amount of additional downforce, mushing you to the Straße.
And as your cherry on top, the AMG Aerodynamics Package also contributes to lower drag, despite the higher downforce. Schlaue Jungs.
Styling Treatments
Other bits and bobs on the outside further distinguish the AMG GT 63 S Edition 1. The paintwork is designo Graphite Grey Magno with matte Graphite Grey stripes on the sides, hood, roof, and decklid. (Hey, go-fast stripes! those should add another 1 mph to your top end, minimum buddy.) There are 21-inch cross-spoke forged wheels, painted matte black with a high-sheen finish, so, you know, you look cool.
Interior Fashions (And Scents)
The interior features such refinements as Multicontour Performance Seats with a Memory Package, Nappa Leather Upholstery in Magma Grey/Black with flashy yellow contrast stitching, a performance steering wheel in DINAMICA microfiber with more yellow stitching, a racy yellow 12 o’clock marking, and an even flashier “Edition 1” badge.
There’s lots of Matte Carbon-Fiber trim, the seatbelts are yellow, and the door center panels are Magma Grey. The instrument panel and door beltline get black Nappa leather with that same yellow top stitching. The door sill panels are illuminated and say “AMG.” There are edition-specific floor mats in black with a leather band and “AMG” lettering and, well this is a surprise, yellow top stitching.

Last but not least, every man, woman, and child on planet Earth will be overcome with joy when they realize the AIR-BALANCE Package comes with a new, dedicated “AMG #63” fragrance. Take your seats, take your seats!!
Power & Performance
The Edition 1 comes with the top-of-the-range, handcrafted AMG 4.0-liter V8 bi-turbo engine, cranking out 630 horsepower and 664 lb-ft. of torque. Result? A top speed of 195 mph with a zero to 60 time of 3.1 seconds.
So like I said, it’s a sedan, but a very good sedan.
Availability
The AMG GT 63 and 63 S will arrive in the United States early next year, with the AMG GT 53 coming in mid-2019.

2018/06/11,GMC Introduces 2019 Yukon Graphite Editions: A Quick Look,"The GMC Yukon stable is getting a new member – two actually – in the form of Graphite Editions. The 2019 Yukon Graphite Editions feature a darkened and shaded exterior theme, while the Graphite Performance Edition adds a few performance-oriented upgrades.
The new Yukons join the Denali Ultimate Black Edition, another special edition Yukon that made its debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show late last year.
Graphite Edition
Styling touches include 22-inch bright machined wheels with Carbon Flash Metallic pockets, black assist steps with gloss black accents, black chrome grille mesh insert, and fog lamp surrounds. Other blacked-out elements include the roof rails and beltline moldings, along with other various trim pieces.
Graphite Performance Edition
This special Yukon includes the aforementioned styling elements but adds GM’s evergreen 6.2-liter V8 engine linked to a 10-speed automatic transmission (3.23 axle ratio) to reduce revolutions at highway speeds. Inside, drivers are treated to Bose Active Noise Cancellation, multi-color heads-up display, navigation, and an eight-inch color infotainment screen.
Power & Performance
The 6.2-liter V8, complete with direct injection, continuously variable valve timing, and Active Fuel Management, puts 420 horses to the pavement; torque is a healthy 460 lb-ft. The Yukon Graphite Performance Edition also gets Magnetic Ride Control, which uses sensors to “read” the road, altering the damping rate of the shocks accordingly.
Along with the upgraded powertrain, the Graphite Performance Edition adds a trailer brake controller, 170-amp alternator, and a higher grade air filter.
Pricing & Availability
The Graphite Editions are available in SLT trim only, but can be had on both the Yukon and Yukon XL in either two-wheel or four-wheel drive. There are three exterior colors: Onyx Black, White Frost Tricoat, and Dark Sky Metallic. Expect the Graphite Editions at dealers later this summer with pricing due closer to that time.

2018/06/09,This New Quantum Computer Science From Volkswagen Will Blow Your Mind,"Volkswagen is making incredible scientific breakthroughs when it comes to the development of electric vehicle batteries. It seems like something out of a science fiction movie. The automaker has, for the first time, succeeded in simulating “industrially relevant molecules” using a quantum computer. VW has successfully simulated molecules like lithium-hydrogen and carbon chains, and are already working on more complex chemical compounds.
What does that mean exactly?
Tailor-Made Designs
VW wants to eventually simulate the chemical structure of a complete electric vehicle battery on a quantum computer. It seems mind-blowing but all this super science has a distinct purpose: the development of high-performance electric vehicle batteries. VW is creating what they call a “tailor-made battery,” or a configurable, production-ready “chemical blueprint.”
VW’s press materials on this topic are focused on the hard science, but reading between the lines one can see the intent. VW will leverage cutting edge science to create a better automobile – in this case, electric ones. And the timing seems right, given how a recent survey from AAA found car buyers are warming up to electric vehicles.
“We are focusing on the modernization of IT systems throughout the Group,” explained Martin Hofmann, Chief Information Officer, Volkswagen Group. “The objective is to intensify the digitalization of work processes – to make them simpler, more secure and more efficient and to support new business models.”
“We intend to acquire the specialist knowledge we need for this purpose now,” added Florian Neukart, Principle Scientist at Volkswagen’s CODE Lab in San Francisco, California. “We are convinced that commercially available quantum computers will open up previously unimaginable opportunities.”
Essential Foundations
With newly developed algorithms, VW has already “laid the foundation” for simulating and optimizing the aforementioned chemical structures of electric vehicle batteries on a quantum computer. In time, the quantum algorithm could simulate the chemical composition of a battery on the basis of different criteria: weight reduction, maximum power density, or cell assembly, for example, and even provide a design that could be more easily produced.
VW believes this will help advance the battery development process, a time-consuming and resource-intensive endeavor for any automaker.
“This is why we are combining our core task with the introduction of specific key technologies for Volkswagen,” Hofmann said. “These include the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, as well as quantum computing.”
Collaboration & Applications
Data scientists, computer linguists, software engineers, and other IT experts from VW are working together in San Francisco and Munich to better understand the potential of quantum computing. Various applications in which quantum computing could be beneficial for the automaker are being closely examined.

“We are working hard to develop the potential of quantum computers for Volkswagen. The simulation of electro-chemical materials is an important project in this context,” Neukart said. “In this field, we are performing genuine pioneering work.”
VW is collaborating with Google and D-Wave who provide the VW teams with access to their systems. In late 2017, VW and Google began a partnership with regard to quantum computing.
“Quantum computing technology opens up new dimensions and represents the fast-track for future-oriented topics. We at Volkswagen want to be among the first to use quantum computing for corporate processes as soon as this technology is commercially available,” Hofmann said at the time. “Thanks to our cooperation with Google, we have taken a major step towards this goal.”
VW will present their research at the CEBIT technology show in Hanover, Germany starting on June 12th.

2018/06/09,"2019 BMW X5: Whatever You Do, Don’t Call It An SUV","Don’t call it an SUV people, it’s a Sports Activity Vehicle, at least if you believe BMW. The new for 2019 BMW X5 is here, and it is, in addition to being an SUV (sorry) also a BMW, so that means it’s also much quicker than you’d expect.
Tipping the scales at over 5,000 lbs. the 2019 BMW X5 will never be presented as a featherweight canyon carver. It is, however, a very competent way to get you, some of your friends, and a bunch of gear down the road (or even a little off-road) pretty quickly.
Depending on which engine you choose, the new X5 can get from full stop to 60 mph in either 5.3 or 5.6 seconds, which is great, given the weight and shape of this beast.
Engine Selections
That performance is all thanks to the engines the X5 can be equipped with: A twin-turbo straight six in the X5 xDrive40i or a blown V8 in the X5 xDrive50i. The 3-liter straight six (not a four-liter, despite the 40i badging) is said to rev like the blazes by BMW. I’ll wait and see on that, but, thanks to the twin-scroll turbocharger and direct injection tech, the six-banger has a maximum output of 335 horsepower and 330 lb-ft. of torque.
Like I said, zero to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds.
The big 8 features turbochargers positioned in the “V” between the cylinder banks. Again, the naming is strange because the V8 displaces 4.4-liters, even if it’s mounted in the xDrive50i. BMW says that newly designed heat plates are there to ensure effective thermal shielding for the crankcase and cylinder head, but I’ll believe that when I see one of these things with a quarter-million miles on it.
Mounting turbos and such within the V always makes me nervous, thermally speaking.
Anyway, the V8 mill puts out 456 horsepower with peak torque at 479 lb-ft. All of which is impressive and all of which adds up to a zero to 60 mph time of 4.6 seconds.
Transmission & Driveline Tech
Each engine is mated to a new version of the Bavarian’s eight-speed Steptronic transmission, with a wider ratio spread and new control electronics for overall efficiency. Downstream is BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive system with a locking rear differential.
The latest generation of the BMW xDrive system is able to split drive torque between the front and rear wheels with even greater precision and speed, and, for added efficiency, full power can be directed to the rear wheels only.
RELATED
Rock Me Amadeus: Will The 2021 Cadillac Escalade Have The Chops?
Right. It’s for “efficiency.”
The standard wheel and tire set up is 19-inch light-alloy wheels, while the M Sport brings 20-inch, twin-spoke wheels to the party. 21 and 22-inch wheels are available.
Laser Focused
All of this new stuff rides in an X5 that is 1.6 inches longer than its predecessor, 2.6 inches wider, and one inch taller. Despite styling issues (the ghost of Chris Bangle still haunts these design corridors), the 2019 BMW X5 has more space for passengers and their stuff. The new X5 comes standard with Adaptive LED headlights and now adds something called, I’m not kidding here, “BMW Laserlights.”
BMW Laserlights feature blue x-shaped elements that split up the hexagonal light sources inside the regular twin headlights.
Interior Treatments
The instrument panel is wide with sweeping horizontal lines and electroplated trim emphasizing the width of the interior. The same finish can be found on the large trim finisher and surrounds and the center console. The fully-digital instrument cluster and the center display are new; the center console hosts the iDrive Controller, the newly designed transmission selector, and all other driving-related controls.
There’s new Vernasca leather upholstery available in five colors and the heated sport seats come with standard electrical adjustments. Optional multi-function seats with massage and ventilation are also available.
The stereo is a fat Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System with 20 speakers and a 1,500-watt output. Rear-seat entertainment comprises a pair of 10.2-inch full-HD touchscreen displays, a Blu-ray- compatible DVD player, two USB ports, an HDMI socket, and two headphone jacks.
So shut up back there!
Trim Levels
xLine and M Sport variants are also part of the mix for 2019. The standard xLine model uses lots of matte aluminum, in the underbody, roof rails, and side window surrounds. The pearl-effect chrome “accentuates the off-road character of the all-new 2019 BMW X5.” Sure, whatever.
The M Sport spec gets you wheel arch trim, bumper trim, rear underbody protection, and side skirts painted in body color, complimented by matte aluminum kidney grille bars. Oh and roof rails and side window surrounds in high-gloss black.
Yeah, that’s the M Sport. Not exactly the fire-breathing M you and I were hopping for.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 X5 is produced at BMW’s Plant Spartanburg and will arrive in showrooms this November. The X5 xDrive40i will start at $60,700 with the X5 50i xDrive beginning at $75,750. Tack on another $995 for destination and handling.

2018/06/08,Mercedes-Benz Launches New Subscription Based Vehicle Service,"The “Mercedes-Benz Collection” has officially launched, a program that allows subscribers to switch between different types of vehicles depending on their needs or lifestyle. The service, a collaboration between Mercedes-Benz USA, Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA, and Mercedes-Benz dealers, is available now in two cities: Nashville and Philadelphia.
Emerging Trends
Mercedes-Benz says they are “testing the waters” with the program for now. In time, it’s possible it will expand to more cities, as the current pilot program is meant to embrace a growing trend among consumers.
“We’re always looking to stay ahead of our customers’ needs and wants, as well as to bring new people to the brand,” explained Dietmar Exler, President and CEO, MBUSA. “We know there is a market opportunity for people who would like the ability to move in and out of vehicles, depending on what they need or want at a particular point in time, or who don’t want to own a vehicle right now.”
“Customer appetites are changing when it comes to how they access products and services, and our financial and mobility services are evolving to fit those demands,” added Geoff Robinson, Vice President, Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC.
Benefits & Perks
The program consists of three tiers – Signature, Reserve, and Premier – with prices ranging from $1,095 to $2,995 per month after a one-time activation fee of $495. Subscribers can then choose from all the available vehicles in that tier, sedans, coupes, cabriolets, roadsters, and wagons among them.
The monthly fee includes insurance, 24/7 roadside assistance, and maintenance. A concierge staff will deliver the desired vehicle, washed, with a full tank of gas, and even take away the prior vehicle. Mercedes-AMG models are also available in each tier and there are no mileage restrictions.
How It Works
The Mercedes-Benz Collection app can be found in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. After it’s downloaded, subscribers go through a brief application process which consists of a driving and credit history check. In most cases, the application is processed and the subscriber is contacted within one business day.
Vehicle requests received by noon can typically be fulfilled the next day.
“We are working to provide one of the most diverse offerings in the market today and expect to learn a lot from this pilot,” Robinson said. “Adding Mercedes-Benz Collection’s subscription services to our product portfolio is a natural fit.”

2018/06/07,"General Motors, Honda Partner For Next Generation Battery Technology","General Motors and Honda have announced an agreement meant to bolster the all-electric vehicle portfolios of both companies. Engineers will be tasked with developing more advanced battery components, including the cell and module, for a next generation system that will return higher energy densities and faster charging times albeit in a smaller, lighter package.
Economies of Scale
The automakers will collaborate based on GM’s next generation battery system with the intent for Honda to source the battery modules from GM. Officials say the collaboration will support each company’s respective and distinct vehicles, while the combined scale and global manufacturing efficiencies will provide greater value to customers.
“This new, multiyear agreement with Honda further demonstrates General Motors’ capability to innovate toward a profitable electric portfolio,” explained Mark Reuss, General Motors Executive Vice President of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain. “GM’s decades of electrification experience and strategic EV investments, alongside Honda’s commitment to advancing mobility, will result in better solutions for our customers and progress on our zero emissions vision.”

2018/06/06,2019 GMC Sierra Elevation: Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,"U2 and GMC now have something in common, in that they both have an “Elevation” in their catalog. For the Irish band, it’s a hip-hop, rock mix that powered the record All That You Can’t Leave Behind in 2001. For the Detroit automaker, it’s a mix of ruggedness and performance that will power their truck lineup in the new year.
“The 2019 Sierra Elevation conveys a youthful, athletic presence that demonstrates GMC’s tailored approach,” explained Rich Latek, GMC Marketing Director. “With inherent truck capabilities and functionality, Elevation is able to take you off the beaten path along with your gear while standing out from the pack.”
Heavy Equipment
While “High Country” may indeed be a Silverado thing, the Sierra Elevation is poised to climb right over the highest of countries. The truck comes with the X31 Off Road package, which includes unique suspension tuning, Rancho shocks, all-terrain tires, a locking rear differential, Hill Descent Control, protective underbody skidplates, and a heavy-duty air filter.
Bonus items include a two-speed transfer case with low-range gearing and dual exhaust.
The integrated Traction Select System means the truck’s performance can better match the conditions at hand. The system, via a dial, adjusts the transmission shift points, throttle mapping, and other systems to give the Sierra Elevation mountain goat-like footing.
In essence, GMC echoes the sentiments expressed by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell in 1967: There Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.
Styling & Design
If the off-road elements don’t immediately do it, the Sierra Elevation should be easy to spot with its LED C-shape “light blade” designs. This signature look includes LED fog lamps and further C-shaped LED elements within the taillights. We see plenty of black exterior accents from the grille insert and tow hooks, to the side window trim and 20-inch aluminum wheels.
The monochromatic door handles, bumpers, and grille surround finish off the truck.
In general, regardless of trim level, the 2019 Sierra is the boldest-looking, most chiseled Sierra in the modern era.
Power & Performance
The Sierra Elevation will put the heat to the pavement, gravel, or mud with a range of engines and transmissions. The evergreen 5.3 and 6.2 return, although they are redesigned for weight savings and better performance. The 5.3 and 6.2 contain the new Dynamic Fuel Management system, a replacement for the current Active Fuel Management. Under the new system, the engine is allowed 17 different modes of cylinder deactivation to boost performance and efficiency.
Standard on the Elevation is a new 2.7-liter turbocharged engine paired to an eight-speed automatic. The engine produces 310 horsepower and 348 lb-ft. of torque. Early next year, the Elevation will be optioned with a new 3.0-liter Duramax connected to a 10-speed automatic.

Hauling The Convoy
GMC says the Sierra Elevation will handle all the gear one can pile on: kayaks, mountain bikes, motorcycles and ATVs, camping and fishing equipment; nothing is off limits. There are more tie-downs, larger rear corner steps, and the available “GearOn rails” to make loading and securing cargo easier.
A 120-volt outlet in the rear supplies power to whatever equipment adventure seekers have in tow.
And when you gotta tow, you gotta tow! GMC’s new ProGrade Trailering feature is an option for the Elevation. The system includes a pre-departure checklist, trailer light test, tire pressure monitoring for the trailer, and maintenance reminders, plus a compatible smartphone app.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Sierra Elevation comes as a double cab in either two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Expect the truck at GMC dealers this fall with pricing information due closer to that time.

2018/06/06,Cadillac To Expand Super Cruise & Other Vehicle-To-Vehicle Communications Systems,"Cadillac is planning to make Super Cruise available on all models beginning in 2020, with other GM brands to follow after that time. Cadillac’s Super Cruise feature can automatically steer, brake, and keep the vehicle positioned on the highway in certain, optimal conditions. The automaker is also planning to offer V2X communications in a high-volume crossover by 2023, and eventually expand that technology across the product range.
Market Position
With the broader implementation of these technologies, GM believes they can better serve consumers in the future.
“The expansion of Super Cruise and V2X communications technology demonstrates Cadillac’s commitment to innovation, and to making customers’ lives better,” explained Mark Reuss, GM Executive Vice President of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain. “GM is just as committed to ushering in a new era of personal transportation, and technologies like these will enable it.”
“Cadillac is proud to be the leader for the company’s innovation,” added Steve Carlisle, Cadillac President.
Super Cruise Features
Super Cruise uses high precision LiDAR map and GPS data, an advanced driver attention system, and a network of camera and radar sensors. Cadillac says customers can drive hands-free on more than 130,000 miles of limited-access freeways in the United States and Canada, provided they have an active OnStar plan with emergency services.
“The driver attention system helps to keep drivers engaged and detects when drivers need to pay more attention to the road,” reads a statement from the automaker. “Even while using Super Cruise, drivers must always pay attention and not use a handheld device.”
Expanding Technology
Cadillac introduced vehicle-to-vehicle communications on the CTS sedan last year, which uses Dedicated Short-Range Communications technology. With a range of nearly 1,000 feet, drivers can be alerted to possible threats in time to avoid a collision. V2X compatible vehicles can decipher hazardous road conditions, traffic light statuses, and upcoming work zones among other things.
V2X technology can also be expanded to help protect roadway users including cyclists and pedestrians.
“Groundbreaking technologies like these continue to provide unparalleled comfort and convenience for our customers,” Carlisle said.

2018/06/06,2019 Audi Q8: A Brief Walk Around,"A more in-depth look at the 2019 Audi Q8 can be found here.
The 2019 Audi Q8 recently made its debut at the Audi Brand Summit in Shenzhen, China. The automaker says the five-passenger SUV will offer advanced connectivity, infotainment and driver assistance systems, and solid on-road capability. The Q8 will serve as the flagship SUV for Audi, who delivered nearly two million vehicles globally last year.
Technology & Connectivity
The MMI operating system utilizes haptic and acoustic feedback that should be fairly easy to acclimate to. Similar to a smartphone, drivers will hear and feel a “click” when they activate a particular function. The MMI system can be personalized with configurable and movable “favorites” buttons.
A natural-language feature means drivers can speak various requests: “I’m hungry,” for example, will prompt the Q8 to search for and suggest nearby eateries.
Those commuting on a daily basis will appreciate the 2019 Audi Q8’s wireless phone charging and Bang & Olufsen stereo.
Styling & Design
The 2019 Audi Q8 represents a new direction for the automaker with regard to SUV design. Exterior highlights include the Singleframe, octagon grille, contoured air inlets, sloping roofline, and “gently inclined” D-pillars.
On the inside, Audi promises plenty of cargo and passenger room as the Q8 is wider and lower than the Q7.
Driving Dynamics
Audi’s signature quattro all-wheel drive technology (no surprise) will be a mainstay of the new Q8. With a mechanical center differential, the Q8 runs a normal power split of 40:60, but when necessary, can divert a substantial amount of power to the axle with the most traction.
An adaptive damping suspension is standard but an air suspension with different drive modes is available.
A range of engines is likely but Audi did not confirm anything specific in their press materials.
Pricing & Availability
Some reports say the 2019 Audi Q8 will be available in Europe toward the end of this year, with the United States market to follow early next year. Other reports say the vehicle will arrive in the U.S. as soon as this fall.
Audi did not officially disclose the release dates or pricing on the 2019 Audi Q8.
They did, however, provide us with this short and informative video on what inspired the new Q8’s design.

2018/06/05,This LEGO McLaren 720S Is Just Plain Cool!,"A full-size LEGO McLaren 720S is now on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California. The 1:1 scale model was completed this past Saturday (June 2nd) when the final orange bricks were attached thanks to the help of museum volunteers.
The full-scale model will be displayed through August 19th as part of an interactive exhibit where attendees can customize their own LEGO McLaren via an iPad app. The customization app includes racing stripes, flames, checkered flags, license plates, and other backgrounds.
Attendees can also add their name and print a custom sticker of the car they designed.
Attention To Detail
McLaren Automotive worked with the only certified group of professional LEGO builders in the United Kingdom for the project. The group provided in-depth engineering and vehicle CAD data in order to bring the LEGO model to life. Complete with a steel frame, the LEGO McLaren 720S consists of more than 280,000 pieces, tipping the scales at 3,200 lbs.
By comparison, the road-going 720S’s dry weight is 2,828 lbs.
It took a team of six working for over 2,000 hours to complete the project by hand. Builders even included the new Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires and corresponding graphics found on the road-going version.
In Person
The Petersen Automotive Museum is located at 6060 Wilshire Boulevard (at Fairfax) in Los Angeles, California, 90036. General admission prices are $16 for adults, $13 for seniors and students, and $8 for children ages three to 12. Active military, personal care attendants, and children under three are admitted for free.
The Petersen’s Discovery Center will also host daily access to race ramps and build tables for museum attendees who want to build their own LEGO race cars.

2018/06/04,Inside The 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid & Plug-in Hybrid,"Even in this day and age of commercially-available electric vehicles like the Tesla Model 3 and Nissan Leaf, sales of hybrid vehicles rose steadily by 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. This represents a 12.4 percent rise in total sales with 368,137 hybrid vehicles sold last year.
It is interesting to point out traditional hybrids are the most popular among the three types of green cars including EVs or electric vehicles and PHEVs or plug-in hybrid vehicles.
This is the primary reason why Hyundai is hard at work in improving the safety, comfort, practicality, and driving enjoyment of the 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid. The Korean automaker is also updating the features of the 2019 Ioniq Electric to make it one of the most desirable EVs that money can buy.
Hybrids Just Want To Have Fun
From a performance perspective, the biggest caveat of hybrid vehicles is the lackluster and anesthetized driving experience. The standard CVT transmission in most hybrid cars is partly to blame, but Hyundai addressed this matter by bolting on a six-speed EcoShift DCT dual-clutch transmission in the 2019 Ioniq Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid.
The new transmission features low-viscosity oil and low-friction bearings to offer a mix of fuel economy and sporty responses. The driver can also select between two transmission modes: ECO and SPORT. The former will optimize the gear selection to deliver better fuel economy while the latter will hold lower gears longer to give you a sportier driving experience.
Want more control? SPORT mode will also ensure the gasoline engine remains ON while the electric motor will offer power assist when you need it most. Both the Hybrid and Plug-in Hybrid models are also equipped with paddle-shifters if you feel the need to shift all six gears at your behest.
Power To The People
The 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid, and Ioniq Electric are all equipped with a compact and highly efficient battery and electric motor. All models come with a lithium-ion polymer battery that is 20 percent lighter than non-polymer variants with lower battery memory sensitivity, better charge and discharge efficiency, and a high maximum output for better responsiveness.
The batteries are located underneath the rear seats to offer an interior volume of 122.7 cubic feet, which is more than the Toyota Prius according to Hyundai. The new Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid and Ioniq Electric is still able to offer a generous interior volume of 119.2 cubic feet despite being equipped with a larger battery system than the Ioniq Hybrid.

The new Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid is powered by a Kappa 1.6-liter, direct-injected four-cylinder Atkinson-cycle motor that cranks out 104 horsepower and 109 lb-ft. of torque. The electric motor is rated at 44.5 kW which helps supplement an additional 60 horsepower of shove.
The electric motor on all Ioniq models is a permanent magnet synchronous unit that is smaller and lighter than conventional motors. It features a rectangular-section cooper wire to decrease the thickness of the core components by up to 10 percent.
Charge Me Up
All 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Electric models are now equipped with a Level-3 DC fast-charging system and SAE Combo Level-3 DC 100kW fast charger. This means you can juice up the lithium-ion polymer battery up to 80 percent in just 23 minutes. I bet your high-end smartphone can’t do that, huh??
For added convenience, the charging system also comes with an integrated In-Cable Control Box (ICCB) that allows you to use a standard household socket.
Hyundai is also working closely with ChargePoint to offer a wider vehicle charging network with more than 32,000 locations in the United States. Still in a rush? The charging network also includes more than 400 Express DC fast-charging sites so you can juice up your Ioniq in about the same time it takes for you to wolf down a succulent 72-ounce steak.
Safe In The Heat of The Moment
The 2019 Hyundai Ioniq comes equipped with a bewildering array of active and passive safety features. The rigid and lightweight body is achieved by utilizing advanced high-strength steel to minimize cabin distortion in a collision.
Advanced safety features are numerous, and include Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist, and Blind-Spot Detection with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert. New for 2019 is Driver Attention Alert and High Beam Assist.
Economy & Efficiency
The 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid with a more powerful 44.5 kW electric motor has an all-electric range of 29 miles and 119 MPGe in EV mode. This vehicle can easily run 52 MPG in hybrid mode. The new Ioniq has a 0.24 coefficient of drag, among the best in a mass-produced vehicle.
The 2019 Ioniq Hybrid is equipped with a less powerful yet still potent 32 kW electric motor that produces an additional 43 horsepower and 125 lb-ft. of torque for a combined output of 139 horsepower and 58 MPG, which is the highest fuel economy rating of any non-plug-in vehicle sold in the USA, according to Hyundai.
If you happen to be considering an EV for your next vehicle, you should take a closer look at the 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Electric. It offers pure electric power courtesy of a 28.0kWh lithium-ion polymer battery and 88kW electric motor that produces 118 horsepower and 218 lb-ft. of torque. This EV has an estimated range of 136 MPGe.

2018/06/02,Porsche Introduces Augmented Reality Glasses for Vehicle Servicing & Repair,"Virtual reality is the biggest thing in the gaming industry. But it seems Porsche has a unique and more practical solution that utilizes augmented reality to fix your car. Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) will start rolling out Tech Live Look to all 189 Porsche dealerships in the United States. The system consists of smartglasses to provide live interaction with remote experts located hundreds of miles away.
If this sounds like the new wave of the future, then you’re right on target.
What Is Augmented Reality?
Glad you asked. Without sounding like a computer boffin with unruly hair and spectacles the size of the London Eye, augmented reality is being developed to enhance or improve the way humans interact in the real world.
We got a good taste of augmented reality with Google Glass back in 2013. It was basically an optical head-mounted display, shaped to resemble a humble pair of eyeglasses. Think of it as your smartphone being projected in your eyes. You can open, read, and respond to emails, search for directions on Google Maps, or chat with your buddies on social media using voice commands.
You still with me? Good. We covered a similar story on Tech Live Look last year. After conducting a series of successful pilots in 2017, the system went live at three Porsche dealerships recently. The goal is to have 75 more dealers go live by the end of this year with the remainder to follow by 2019.
How Does Tech Live Look Work?
The system works like a carefully balanced orchestra. Dealer technicians will wear smartglasses to connect to the augmented reality software while fixing your Porsche. Remote experts from far away can see in real-time a high-definition video feed of what the technician is working on courtesy of the glasses.
But what if the technician gets puzzled by, say, an issue with the electric power steering? Instead of leaving the floor and tolling away at the computer or phone in the office, the Porsche technical support team (located in Atlanta) can simply press a couple of buttons to project step-by-step technical bulletins, repair procedures, and schematic drawings on the display in the technician’s glasses. This means faster repair times and better efficiency.
The technician can also open and view documents while working on the vehicle. This is better than browsing the pages of the service manual with dirty hands, and it sure beats making multiple phone calls, sending emails, and making on-site visits to identify and diagnose the issue for repair.

Customer Focused
With the Tech Live Look system in full swing, PCNA is looking to dramatically shorten service resolution times – by up to 40 percent.
“By solving issues faster, our dealer partners can get their customers back into cars with less disruption. And our overall service quality increases as we share expertise more efficiently between our experts and dealer technicians,” said Klaus Zellmer, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America. “Tech Live Look is the kind of digital innovation Porsche values because it raises the quality of the customer experience.”
Porsche’s Tech Live Look is the first such application at scale in U.S. auto repair, and won a best-in-class award from the annual Field Service USA conference back in April.
There is no other way to put it. Tech Live Look is one of the coolest things to ever happen in auto repair.

2018/06/01,FCA Expands Partnership With Waymo For Greater Autonomous Mobility,"FCA US LLC and Waymo are expanding their partnership further, this time with an agreement to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Waymo’s self-driving fleet. Vehicle deliveries are expected late this year, and both companies are discussing the use of Waymo’s self-driving technology, including potentially licensing it, in a FCA-manufactured vehicle available to retail customers.
Innovation & Accessibility
Earlier this year, FCA US LLC delivered 500 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Waymo to boost the tech company’s autonomous driving program. To date, FCA has delivered 600 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Waymo.
“FCA is committed to bringing self-driving technology to our customers in a manner that is safe, efficient, and realistic,” said Sergio Marchionne, Chief Executive Officer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. “Strategic partnerships, such as the one we have with Waymo, will help to drive innovative technology to the forefront.”
“Waymo’s goal from day one has been to build the world’s most experienced driver and give people access to self-driving technology that will make our roads safer,” added Waymo CEO John Krafcik.
Future Goals
One of the goals for FCA and Waymo was to develop an autonomous vehicle for mass production. The partnership paired FCA and Waymo engineers together who devised ways to implement Waymo’s automated technology into the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. Leaders from both companies say leveraging each other’s strengths, experiences, and resources is critical for the successful and safe implementation of autonomous driving.
FCA and Waymo engineers have continued working together to support Waymo’s expansion, and to advance the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid with autonomous technology. Waymo’s self-driving system includes a powerful hardware and software suite honed over 6 million miles of on-road testing.
Later this year, Waymo will launch a self-driving transportation service, allowing the public to use Waymo’s app to request a vehicle.
“We’re excited to deepen our relationship with FCA that will support the launch of our driverless service, and explore future products that support Waymo’s mission,” Krafcik said.

2018/06/01,SoftBank Vision Fund To Invest Over 2 Billion In GM Cruise,"The SoftBank Vision Fund will invest $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings LLC, a move aimed at strengthening the company’s plans to commercialize and scale autonomous vehicle technology. General Motors will also invest $1.1 billion in GM Cruise upon closing of the SoftBank Vision Fund transaction.
“Our Cruise and GM teams together have made tremendous progress over the last two years,” explained GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. “Teaming up with SoftBank adds an additional strong partner as we pursue our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion.”
Increased Flexibility
The SoftBank Vision Fund’s first tranche of $900 million will come at the closing of the transaction. The second installment of $1.35 billion (with regulatory approval) will be completed by the Vision Fund when the Cruise AV vehicles are ready for commercial deployment. The SoftBank Vision Fund will then own a near 20 percent equity stake in GM Cruise. Officials say the relationship will allow increased flexibility with respect to capital allocation.
“We’re excited to be joining forces with a tech leader who shares our belief that AV technology will change the world,” said GM President Dan Ammann. “We look forward to partnering with SoftBank as we work toward deploying this technology safely and in massive scale.”
“GM has made significant progress toward realizing the dream of completely automated driving to dramatically reduce fatalities, emissions, and congestion,” added Michael Ronen, Managing Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers. “The GM Cruise approach of a fully integrated hardware and software stack gives it a unique competitive advantage.”
The GM and SoftBank Vision Fund investments are expected to provide the necessary capital to reach commercialization at scale, beginning already next year. Earlier this year, GM filed a Safety Petition with the Department of Transportation for its fourth-generation self-driving Cruise AV. The petition says the Cruise AV would be the first production-ready vehicle to operate safely with no driver, steering wheel, pedals, or manual controls.
“We are very impressed by the advances made by the Cruise and GM teams, and are thrilled to help them lead a historic transformation of the automobile industry,” Ronen said.

2018/05/30,Jaguar Land Rover Takes Autonomous Vehicles Off-Road,"When normal streets are not enough, Jaguar Land Rover wants an autonomous off-road vehicle that can canvass any terrain in any condition. The project, called “CORTEX” (which sounds like a patented insulation material for gloves), will take automation into the dirt, rain, ice, snow, and fog. Jaguar Land Rover is developing off-road self-driving SUVs under the program which serves as a performance benchmark.
“It’s important that we develop our self-driving vehicles with the same capability and performance customers expect from all Jaguars and Land Rovers,” said Chris Holmes, Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Research Manager, Jaguar Land Rover.
Pushing Boundaries
Under CORTEX, a “5D technique” is being engineered, or one that combines acoustic, video, distance sensing, radar, and LiDAR data in real-time to give the vehicle an increased awareness of its surroundings. Machine learning will also help the driverless vehicles navigate a variety of terrains and conditions. Ultimately, Jaguar Land Rover wants both full and semi-automated vehicles for customers, offering them a choice as to which level of automation they would like.
“Self-driving is an inevitability for the automotive industry and ensuring that our autonomous offering is the most enjoyable, capable, and safe is what drives us to explore the boundaries of innovation,” Holmes said. “CORTEX gives us the opportunity to work with some fantastic partners whose expertise will help us realize this vision in the near future.”

2018/05/30,2019 Ford F-150 Raptor Gets New Suspension & Upgraded Tech,"It is foolish to mess with a proven formula. When Ford bolted on a twin-turbocharged, 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 to the second-generation Raptor, hardcore off-roaders were dismayed.
But when critics found out the motor churns out 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft. of torque, the new Raptor was welcomed with open arms. The new power plant produced 40 more horsepower and more torque than the heavier 6.2-liter V8.
Change is inevitable. In this case, the changes were for the better.
For 2019, Ford is upping the ante once again by giving the 2019 F-150 Raptor an all-new adaptive suspension along with a host of comfort features and clever tech.
Shock & Awe
Further cementing its status as the ultimate high-performance off-road truck, the 2019 Ford F-150 Raptor is equipped with electronically-controlled Fox 3.0 Internal Bypass shocks with LIVE Valve Technology. The 2019 Raptor also comes with a new Trail Control System, which is cruise control designed for low-speed and rugged terrain.
“Raptor’s success is rooted in its incredible suspension, superb vehicle control, and the confidence the truck instills in its owners,” said Hermann Salenbauch, Global Director, Ford Performance Vehicle Programs. “Upgrades to the 2019 F-150 Raptor have improved all three to new levels that the competition will have to benchmark – again.”
Ford worked closely with Fox to further hone the existing internal bypass shock absorbers. The result is an electronically-controlled Live Valve Technology that continuously adjusts damping in real-time. The system utilizes sensors in the suspension and body to maximize comfort, all-terrain handling, and bottom-out resistance.
“By automatically varying compression rates, Raptor can now make the most of its suspension travel of 13 inches at the front and 13.9 inches at the rear,” Salenbauch said.
Hang Time
Have you ever heard of a suspension that automatically adjusts the damper settings when the vehicle is in midair?
“The 2019 Raptor is not just more capable off-road. It’s smarter,” Salenbauch continued. “Not many trucks need sensors to detect when you are midair. Raptor sets the dampers to full stiffness to help smooth shock performance as the truck lands.”
This may sound a bit silly, but the current F-150 Raptor is one of the most refined vehicles you can buy today. The upgraded Fox Live Valve suspension enables the Raptor to achieve new heights in all-terrain versatility and performance. When paired with the Raptor’s Terrain Management System, the Live Valve Suspension Technology will confidently traverse even the most unforgiving terrain at high-speed, while still retaining a smooth on-road performance.

Off-Road Cruise Control
The 2019 F-150 Raptor is also equipped with a new Trail Control system. It can automatically adjust and send power and braking force to each individual wheel. The system can be activated at speeds from 1 mph up to 20 mph depending on the driveline position.
Trail Control can feed engine torque to the driving wheels so you can easily climb over steep obstacles. The system can also brake each wheel individually, so the Raptor comes down smoothly on the other side of whatever you are climbing. It is a fool-proof system that allows you to focus on steering over rugged terrain.
Hold Me Tight
Also new for the 2019 Ford F-150 Raptor are Recaro sport seats. The seats are designed to offer aggressive support and substantial bolstering to smoothen those nasty kidney shots over rugged, uneven terrain. Available seat designs include blue Alcantara inserts and accent stitching inspired by the interior of the bonkers Ford GT supercar.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Ford F-150 Raptor is all yours by late 2018, and comes in three new colors: Ford Performance Blue, Velocity Blue, and Agate Black.
The upgraded 2019 F-150 Raptor will be built at the Dearborn Truck Plant. Ford has not disclosed pricing at this time.

2018/05/28,2019 Mercedes-AMG E 53 Sedan: Fast Saloon Gets Mild Hybrid Technology,"The mere mention of the word “hybrid” is enough to ruin the day of a true-blue petrol head. But the 2019 Mercedes-AMG E 53 Sedan begs to differ. Yes, this fast German saloon is equipped with an electrified, AMG-enhanced motor called EQ Boost. If this sounds like the cushioning technology of a popular sneaker brand, you’re not very far off.
But instead of protecting your feet, the EQ Boost starter-alternator-generator is designed to create power for the 48-volt on-board electrical system. It all sounds very complex, but the result is 429 horsepower (6,100 rpm) and 384 lb-ft. of torque (1,800-5,800 rpm).
This is the same 48-volt hybrid assist system that powers the coupe and convertible versions of the E 53, including the Mercedes-AMG CLS 53, which both debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show.
Luxurious Performance
Unless you’re living under a rock somewhere in New Mexico, you are probably familiar with the acceleration and performance characteristics of electric cars. Adding the EQ Boost system to an AMG-tuned and turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six sounds like a recipe for a good time, don’t you agree?
The Mercedes E-class is the epitome of a midsize luxury sedan. But the performance wizards at AMG were able to transform the 2019 Mercedes-AMG E 53 Sedan into an electrified performance monster without penalizing ride quality and comfort.
I hope you don’t mind me asking, but when was the last time Mercedes fitted an inline-six into the E-class? The magic starts with a proper 3.0-liter inline-six fitted with a conventional exhaust-driven turbocharger, which is pointing head-on into BMW territory. But apparently, this wasn’t enough.
Intelligent Electrification
Mercedes-AMG developed the EQ Boost starter-generator to provide “intelligent electrification.” The EQ Boost combines a starter and alternator in a powerful electric motor. The system is fitted between the engine and transmission.
I guess we’ve seen this before, in the former Honda Insight hybrid vehicle, but EQ Boost can do so much more than basic hybrid functions: energy recovery, gliding mode, shifting of the load point – it can even restart the gasoline motor with the start/stop function.
The system can supply an immediate burst of power to turn an electric auxiliary compressor. What this means is an instant rush of torque similar to a diesel motor, along with the famed smoothness and refinement of an inline-six.
48-Volt Electrical System
The EQ Boost system in the 2019 Mercedes-AMG E53 Sedan generates power for the 48-volt on-board electrical system. It also supplies 12-volt juice courtesy of a DC/DC converter. The 12-volt system will still supply power to the cockpit, infotainment system, and lights. On the other hand, the 48-volt system can supply power to the electric compressor to boost horsepower and torque.

The system can immediately provide 21 horsepower and 184 lb-ft. of torque with a drop of your right foot. When added to the existing power output, the result is a seamless and mesmerizing driving experience.
Transmission &  Traction
Harnessing the power of the turbocharged inline-six and EQ Boost electric compressor is the AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9G Transmission. This unit provides short shift times, multiple downshifts, and a double-declutching function. It also delivers faster responses to shift paddle commands so you can drive like Lewis Hamilton.
Power is routed to the 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive system that can transition from rear-wheel to all-wheel drive and vice versa. The result is better handling and optimal traction on dry, wet, or snowy roads.
Drive Modes
The 2019 Mercedes-AMG E53 comes with five Dynamic Select drive modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+, and Individual. The latter allows you to tailor the characteristics of the Mercedes-AMG E53. Want firmer steering with a more compliant ride? Done. You can basically go from mild to extra spicy with a press of a button.
Ride & Handling
The damping forces at each wheel are adjusted accordingly to suit any type of driving situation. The 2019 Mercedes-AMG E53 Sedan is fitted with an AMG-tuned, multi-chamber air suspension with ADS+ (the automakers “Adaptive Damping System”). The system is based on the Air Body Control technology developed in Affalterbach, Southern Germany. The result is neutral cornering with less body roll, better traction, and greater levels of ride comfort.
Modern Interior
The new AMG E 53 Sedan is equipped with a standard widescreen cockpit with virtual instrument panels. The 12.3-inch display is located above the central console so you can fiddle with the infotainment system, which can also be operated via the touchpad controller or by voice control. The voice command feature has been recalibrated so you can control things like the air conditioning, seat heating and cooling, and even the interior lights.
The AMG performance steering wheel in black Nappa leather, with red 12 o’clock markings, is standard.
Pricing & Availability
With an electronically-limited top speed of 130 mph and a zero to 60 time of 4.4 seconds, the 2019 Mercedes-AMG E 53 Sedan is more than a valid replacement for the previous AMG E 43 Sedan. You can expect the E 53 Sedan in the United States by late 2018. Pricing has not been disclosed yet.

Inside, drivers are treated to a moonroof, leather seats, and a Bose premium audio system. A special “Concierge” package provides 24/7 live access to things like dinner reservations or ticket purchases. The service is free for the first three years for Edition ONE owners.
So if you want to hit that prime seafood spot before heading out to that hot jazz show, Nissan has you covered.
“Plus, the super-premium gifts should appeal to their love of the latest technologies – in their cars and their homes,” Hayes added.
Gift selections, redeemable a week after purchase, include an Amazon Echo Show and Amazon Prime membership, a Bose Soundlink Revolve+ with an Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Prime membership, or a Series 3 Apple Watch.
2019 Altima: At A Glance
The new Nissan Altima is powered by one of two engines: the standard 2.5-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder, complete with direct injection or an industry first, production-ready variable compression inline four-cylinder turbo. Nissan says the latter, available on the SR and Platinum, delivers “V6 attitude with four-cylinder fuel economy.” All-wheel drive is available.
ProPILOT Assist, a single-lane “hands-on” assistance technology, is standard on the SV, SL, Platinum, and Edition ONE. If that description seems like a lot (and it does), Nissan has provided this quick instructional video on ProPILOT Assist. Also available is Rear Automatic Braking, which helps warn of unforeseen stationary objects when backing up, and can apply the brakes to help avoid a collision if necessary.
The Nissan Safety Shield package includes a number of other advanced safety features.
Trim Levels & Availability
When it arrives this fall, expect the 2019 Altima in five trim levels: S, SR, SV, SL, and Platinum – plus the Edition ONE which reservations open for on June 15th. Those who reserve a “normal” Altima on that day will still be granted a special gift selection as well.

2018/05/23,"Inside The 2019 Chevy Silverado: Engineering Metrics, Materials Strategy & Engines","Fresh off its debut earlier this year at the North American International Auto Show, The 2019 Chevy Silverado is looking to be the all-inclusive truck in an increasingly competitive segment. When it finally hits showrooms, the 2019 Silverado will offer eight different trim levels and six different engine and transmission options, something the automaker says is paramount.
“That allows every customer to get the exact truck they want,” explained Scott Damman, Lead Development Engineer, 2019 Silverado. “All these trim levels allow us to have a truck for every customer.”
Extreme Metrics
In an effort to secure a position as that all-inclusive truck, the 2019 Silverado was subjected to GM’s most rigorous engineering metrics in history. The Silverado team essentially doubled their validation targets, performing over 475,000 tests and logging seven million miles of real-world testing in the interest of durability.
“It is pretty daunting,” Damman said. “Especially when you think about a vehicle that is redesigned from the ground up – brand new – everything is brand new.”
Each engine was subjected to repeat “torture testing” which included visits to the dynamometer cells. Inside, the engines would run for months on end – without stopping – to simulate a lifetime of maximum hot and cold cycles. From there, the Silverado team traveled to Davis Dam in Arizona where the truck hauled its maximum gross combined vehicle weight up a seven percent grade in 110-degree heat. The benchmark of this test was to incur no loss in performance even with the air conditioner running.
“By taking 450 lbs. out we can give that performance back to our customers,” Damman said referring to how the new Silverado is 450 lbs. lighter when compared to the current generation with a V8. “When that 450 lbs. is not being lugged down the road because of the truck itself, it gives you that capacity.”
Light & Tight
The 2019 Silverado’s actual body is 88 lbs. lighter and its fully boxed steel frame, despite being 88 lbs. lighter, offers a 10 percent increase in torsional rigidity. The live-axle rear suspension is also redesigned, including new carbon-composite, second-stage springs on LT models that cut about 12 lbs. (per side) over the steel springs they replace.
“The engineering team was actually tasked with going and looking at every single part for weight savings,” Damman explained. “To do that we actually went to our suppliers and our supply base to begin pulling on new technology, which included new processes for building things. We learned about what they have and by doing so, we were able to get lighter materials in the truck, but build it stronger so it will give that performance back to our customers.”

The doors, hood, and tailgate are made from aluminum while the fenders, roof, and bed utilize high-strength steel. The underlying safety cage uses seven different grades of steel. 80 percent of the frame consists of high-strength steel, varying from two to five millimeters in thickness, depending on location. Hydroforming, roll forming, conventional stamping, and tailor-rolled blanking are all performed during manufacturing.
“We like to call it our mixed materials strategy,” Damman added. “Where we could get away from high-strength steel we did, and that transfers some of that cost and weight savings back to customers.”
Corvettes & Customers
Another test was borrowed from the Corvette’s book, whereby the 2019 Silverado was subjected to sharp tilt angles. These “tilt stands” dip the truck at an angle of up to 53 degrees, and can simulate angles at a rate of up to 40 degrees a second, the equivalent of up to 1.4g. This test helps ensure proper engine and transmission lubrication.
“We have a lot of performance factors that we look into early on in the program,” Damman said. “There is a whole group of people that actually set those performance requirements as we look at our current generation Silverado.”
Among those groups of people are Silverado customers.
“We take our customer’s feedback and we try to figure out how to balance all of their requirements,” Damman added. “By doing that early on we have something to work towards.”
Engine Lineup
The evergreen 5.3 and 6.2 return to the Silverado lineup, this time equipped with Dynamic Fuel Management. The new system replaces the current Active Fuel Management and allows for 17 different modes of cylinder deactivation to boost performance and efficiency. Power figures, although unchanged from 2017, remain quite healthy: the 5.3 outputs 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft. of torque, contrasted to the 6.2 which creates 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of torque.
Chevrolet estimates about half of the new trucks will be equipped with one of these two engines.
“The 5.3 and 6.2, although they have been around for a while, have been redesigned and rebuilt for weight savings and better performance,” Damman said. “Our propulsion team had the same task as the rest of our engineering team: to figure out ways to make things stronger, save weight, and increase performance.”
The 4.3-liter V6 sees an increase in torque and fuel efficiency for 2019. The standard engine on the Silverado LT and new RST now creates 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft. of torque. Also in the mix is the new 2.7-liter Turbo with Active Fuel Management. The new turbocharged offering for the Silverado creates 310 horsepower and 348 lb-ft. of torque.

Last but certainly not least, a Duramax 3.0-liter inline-six joins the lineup.
“It is an all-new engine developed by our propulsion team at GM,” Damman said. “It fits in nicely for a full-size truck, and all the performance factors were taken into account.”
Depending on engine choice, the 2019 Silverado will come with either a six, eight or 10-speed automatic.
Availability & Manufacturing
Assembly of crew cab V8s will begin in the third quarter, with double and regular cab models joining in the fourth quarter. Production of the 4.3-liter V6 and 2.7-liter Turbo are also scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter, with the Duramax being available in early 2019. EPA fuel economy estimates and towing and payload capacities are not yet available.
When it arrives, the 2019 Chevy Silverado will have eight different trim levels, including an off-road-oriented Trailboss.
“I think we can get a lot of new customers into these trucks,” Damman said. “We have the right team in place that can take it there and get it to the next level.”

2018/05/23,Traffic Fatalities Likely To Increase Over Memorial Day Weekend Experts Say,"Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and with the holiday comes an increase in travel. The National Safety Council is urging drivers to exercise caution, saying over 400 may be killed this year during Memorial Day weekend. The organization also estimates that nearly 46,000 could be seriously injured during the three-day holiday period.
Memorial Day weekend officially begins at 6 p.m. Friday, May 25th, and ends at 11:59 p.m. Monday, May 28th.
Deadly Season
In general, summer can be a risky season of travel with July 4th often being billed as the most dangerous holiday. When compared to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day, the three summertime holidays – Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day – typically claim over 110 lives each day, the highest average per-day fatality rates.
“Memorial Day should mark the start of summer – not a deadly driving season,” said Deborah A.P. Hersman, President and CEO of the National Safety Council. “If we pay attention, slow down and be courteous, we can increase our chances of making it to picnics, beaches, and barbecues rather than emergency rooms.”
Dangers of Distraction
Distracted driving is among the leading causes of traffic accidents today with texting and driving being one of the primary culprits. Motorists may think “just glancing” at their phone is okay, but even that can prove fatal.
“This inattention, no matter how slight, can endanger the driver, passengers, and innocent bystanders,” explained Special First Lieutenant and Traffic Safety Specialist Jim Flegel of the Michigan State Police. “The sad part is that 100 percent of crashes related to distracted driving are preventable.”
Advice & Insight
The National Safety Council is encouraging everyone this weekend to buckle up, drive defensively, and to get plenty of sleep before traveling. At events where alcohol is involved, the National Safety Council says finding alternative transportation or designating a sober driver is the best protocol. The Michigan State Police continue to warn the public on the dangers of drugged driving.
“We have done a pretty good job of educating the public about not getting behind the wheel when you’re impaired on alcohol, but the word is still not out yet about making sure you do not get behind the wheel when you are impaired on any other drugs,” Flegel said. “And that also includes prescription medication.”
The National Safety Council has provided additional information about Memorial Day weekend, including fatality estimates and motor vehicle data and research. The Michigan State Police have provided a few key safety tips, which are listed below.

2018/05/22,2019 Mercedes AMG GT S Roadster: Ragtop Middle Child Debuts With 515 Horsepower,"The 2019 Mercedes AMG GT S Roadster is regarded as the ragtop middle child in the AMG GT family. It is equipped with the same burly and turbocharged AMG V8 motor of the AMG GT S Coupe that produces 515 horsepower and 494 lb-ft. of torque between 1,900 and 5,000 rpm.
“The new model represents the perfect alternative for the performance-oriented AMG GT Roadster customer,” said Tobias Moers, Chairman of Mercedes-AMG GmBH. “With the AMG GT S Roadster, our AMG family has gained another exceptionally sporty member that combines high driving dynamics with an emotional open air experience.”
Power & Performance
Can’t make up your mind between the vanilla 469 horsepower AMG GT Roadster and 550 horsepower AMG GT C? Mercedes is offering the AMG GT S Coupe with 515 horsepower but what if you want a convertible? Well, now you can. The 2019 Mercedes AMG GT S Roadster features a three-layered fabric soft top, so you can better immerse yourself in those glorious and guttural sounds: that magnificent AMG soundtrack as you step on the gas.
The AMG GT S Roadster is equipped with the same 515 horsepower, twin-turbocharged and handcrafted 4.0-liter V8 found in the AMG GT S Coupe. The mill is connected to an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7G transmission with an electronically-controlled, rear axle limited slip-differential, which is standard equipment on the AMG GT C Roadster.
This means zero to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 192 mph. That is only four mph less than the race-oriented AMG GT C Roadster.
Suspension & Braking
Standard on the 2019 AMG GT S Roadster is AMG Ride Control with adaptive damping. Featuring a fully-automatic and electronically-controlled suspension system that varies damping force at each wheel, you get tight handling, precise steering, and a ride quality that won’t disappoint your chiropractor.
The suspension can be configured to Comfort, Sport, and Sport + so you can go from mild to wild by simply pressing a switch on the center console.
The front axle is equipped with composite brake discs and six-piston fixed calipers. The rear also comes with composite discs and single-piston fixed calipers. Optional is the AMG high-performance ceramic composite braking system with larger-diameter brake discs.
Lightweight & Aerodynamic
The 2019 Mercedes AMG GT S Roadster utilizes lightweight composite materials and aluminum for the spaceframe. The load-bearing structures are constructed from SMC or Sheet Molding Compound to reduce weight without sacrificing rigidity.
The front deck is largely composed of magnesium to help further reduce inertia over the front axle. The result is an incredibly agile and precise roadster that you simply point and shoot with a firm press of the throttle.

The new AMG GT S Roadster is also equipped with the AIRPANEL active air management system to govern the behavior of incoming air. You will find vertical louvers at the bottom of the front bumper that can automatically open or close to either provide engine cooling or better aerodynamics.
Of course, no AMG GT model is complete without the extendable rear spoiler to reduce lift at higher speeds.
Selectable Drive Modes
Unlike the humdrum AMG GT with only four driving modes, the new AMG GT S Roadster is equipped with the same AMG Dynamic Select controller of the AMG GT C with five driving modes. Besides the usual Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus (and the Individual mode you can program to your liking), the AMG GT S Roadster also comes with RACE mode so you can teach wannabe street racers a thing or two on what racing really means.
Otherwise, the all-wheel steering of the AMG GT C is NOT standard on the 2019 AMG GT S Roadster. Frankly, this is a bit of a letdown. But we guess Mercedes-AMG will offer this feature as an option later on. We certainly hope so.
Pricing & Availability
The Mercedes-AMG GT S Roadster will be available in the United States near the end of the year with pricing information due closer to that time.

2018/05/21,"Volvo Cuts Diesel From New S60, Further Commits To Electrification","When the Volvo S60 arrives later this spring it will not offer a diesel powertain, a move the automaker says is part of their commitment to a “long-term future beyond the traditional combustion engine.” Volvo is one of the industry’s strongest proponents for electrification and will drop diesel powertrains in favor of EV technology.
“Our future is electric and we will no longer develop a new generation of diesel engines,” said Håkan Samuelsson, President and Chief Executive of Volvo Cars.
Electrification Strategy
All new Volvo models launched from 2019 will be available as either a mild petrol hybrid, plug-in petrol hybrid or battery electric vehicle. Earlier this year, the automaker reinforced its electrification strategy, stating their desire to have electric cars make up 50 percent of their global sales by 2025.
“The new S60 represents the next step in that commitment,” Samuelsson added. “We will phase out cars with only an internal combustion engine, with petrol hybrid versions as a transitional option as we move towards full electrification.”
Availability & Manufacturing
The new S60, based on Volvo’s in-house Scalable Product Architecture, will first be available with a range of four-cylinder Drive-E petrol engines, along with two petrol plug-in hybrid versions. Mild hybrid versions will follow next year. Production will begin this fall at Volvo’s new manufacturing facility outside Charleston, South Carolina.

2018/05/21,2019 BMW M5 Competition Raises M5 Bar Considerably,"Question: What’s better than a BMW M5? Answer: The 2019 BMW M5 Competition. Think of it as an M5 only more so. Whatever the “normal” M5 has, the Competition offers more of. And anybody who finds any M5 “normal” I have serious questions about.
The original M5, for those who need a refresher, is the byproduct that happens when one of the inventors of the “sports sedan” really decides to let it all hang out. The first M5 was a frighteningly capable car and they only got more and more potent from there on out. For one iteration, BMW’s M5 had a V10 plant residing under it’s broad hood – in a sedan!
Who does that? Bavarian gearheads, that’s who.
Power & Performance
At any rate, this new, even M-ier M5 carries on that fine hot-rodding tradition. And like all hot rods, this is all about that engine baby! Oh sure, the M5 Comp turns and stops like the business too, but we all know what that “M” in BMW stands for. And in this specific instance, it stands for a high-revving M TwinPower Turbo 4.4-liter V8 that generates 617 horsepower and a tug-like 553 lb-ft. of torque. All that re-tuning to optimize torque and power delivery pays off with a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of just 3.1 seconds; the 124 mph mark reached in 10.8 seconds, and the whole shebang topping out at 189 big ones.
All that is even more impressive since the M5 Comp weighs, huh, that’s funny, BMW doesn’t mention how much this thing weighs. I’m guessing north of 4,000 lbs. but slightly less than the all up displacement of the Scharnhorst.
Torque Distribution
All that Leistung is put to the Straße via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and an M xDrive all-wheel drive system. Yes, it’s all-wheel drive, but the M xDrive system, which made its debut in the “standard” 2019 BMW M5, distributes the engine’s torque between the front and rear wheels via a transfer case with a fully variable, electronically-controlled multi-plate clutch – and then the Active M Differential splits the torque between the rear wheels as needed.
The M xDrive system is explicitly rear-wheel biased, so this big four-door gets incredible agility and, thanks to the Dynamic Stability Control, drive torque is distributed between the front and rear axles at the press of a button. The M Dynamic mode gives you greater slip angles and “particularly fun handling,” according to BMW.
There is the option for pure rear-wheel drive that allows “experienced and skilled drivers” to bask with no control system intervention. BMW has even gone so far as to tweak the engine mounts to optimize responsiveness and cornering characteristics.
RELATED

Ride & Handling
Speaking of the handling, the M5 Competition gets model-specific chassis tuning with double-wishbones up front and a five-link deal holding up the back end. An M-specific version of the Variable Damper Control system is along for the ride with Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus modes on tap. The M Servotronic steering is an electromechanical setup.
Ride height has been dropped seven millimeters over the “normal” M5 Sedan along with tweaks to the springs and dampers, increased negative camber at the front, and toe links with ball joints instead of rubber mounts for more precise wheel control at the rear. The rate of the rear anti-roll bar is firmed up, so body roll during high-speed cornering is distributed with a pronounced rear bias. Huzzah!
Stopping is taken care of with low-weight M compound brakes with six-piston fixed calipers and perforated, inner-vented brake discs at the front, and single-piston floating calipers with an integrated parking brake at the rear. Optional M carbon-ceramic brakes are there for the asking, and you should really ask.
Styling Treatments
Visually setting the M5 Competition apart are specially-designed light-alloy wheels, high-gloss black finishers on the door handles, mirror bases and triangles, exterior mirror caps and the mesh of the gills in the front flanks. The trademark kidney grille’s surrounds are also high-gloss black along with the detailing on the rear bumper cover. The tailpipes come in black chrome and both the rear spoiler and “M5 Competition” trunk logo are finished in high-gloss black.
A distinctive “M Competition” graphic is found in the instrument cluster to greet the driver as the vehicle is starting up, and to let you know how special you are (like Beemer drivers need any more encouragement in this arena).
Sadly, no word on pricing or availability, but you still want one, don’t you?

2018/05/16,Ford To Resume F-150 Production After Extraordinary Efforts,"Despite a massive fire at the Meridian Magnesium Products facility in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, Ford’s Dearborn Truck Plant will resume F-150 production on Friday, May 17th. Ford says the supply chain for the Super Duty is also restored, and production should restart at the Kentucky Truck Plant by Monday, May 21st. The Kansas City Assembly Plant, which produces F-150s, is also scheduled to resume operations by May 21st.
“While the situation remains extremely dynamic, our teams are focused on returning our plants to full production as fast as possible,” explained Joe Hinrichs, Ford President, Global Operations.
Heavy Equipment
After the May 2nd fire, teams addressed safety concerns and restored electricity as quickly as they could. The goal was to retrieve and relocate tools so production could resume, and the financial impacts of the stalled plants could be minimized. The teams ultimately removed 19 dies (a tool used to cut or shape material using a press) from Meridian’s fire-damaged facility.
In one instance, teams moved an 87,000 lbs. die from Eaton Rapids, Michigan to Nottingham, U.K. in a mere 30 hours. Under normal circumstances, something of this magnitude would take 10 days when considering import and export approvals and flight logistics. The die was sent to Rickenbacker International Airport in Columbus, Ohio where it was loaded onto an Antonov An-124 Ruslan, an aircraft renowned for its heavy cargo capacity.
“Faced with unexpected adversity, the Ford team, including our global supply partners, showed unbelievable resiliency, turning a devastating event into a shining example of teamwork,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s Executive Vice President of Product Development and Purchasing.
Last Minute Approval
Nearly 4,000 miles away, a team in Nottingham was waiting to take the die to Meridian’s nearby factory. A U.K. import license for the die was granted only two hours before the plane landed.
“Thanks to their heroic efforts, we are resuming production of some of our most important vehicles ahead of our original targets,” Thai-Tang said.
“The ramp-up time to full production is improving every day,” Hinrichs added.
Most of the dies have been repaired, and Meridian is now producing parts for the F-150 in both Eaton Rapids and Nottingham. Parts produced at Nottingham will be shipped daily on a Boeing 747 until production in Eaton Rapids resumes fully. Ford says current F-150 inventory remains strong and customers should experience no delays in finding the truck they want.

2018/05/14,VW Golf GTI TCR Concept Might Be Coming Soon,"Volkswagen has unveiled the Golf GTI TCR Concept, something the automaker says is an expression of design, power, and performance. This special edition VW is a road-going version of the race car with the same name, and although it’s a concept currently, that is expected to change.
“At the moment, the Golf GTI TCR Concept – an athlete derived from racing – is a study,” explained Jürgen Stackmann, Sales, Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, during the unveiling at the recent GTI Meeting at Wörthersee. “But at the end of the year, we want to make this GTI vision come true.”
Power & Performance
The Golf GTI TCR Concept features a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that produces 286 horsepower and 273 lb-ft. of torque (1,600 rpm). Power is sent to the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. The front bumper channels air into two additional radiators.
Top speed is 155 but can be increased to 164 by removing the electronic limiter.
There is an electric adaptive damping system with three modes – normal, comfort, and sport – to increase ride and handling capabilities. Although VW’s press materials didn’t give any specific details, the automaker says the braking system consists of “special” calipers and pads.
Styling & Design
The new Golf GTI rides on 18-inch “Belvedere” forged aluminum-alloy wheels with an option for 19-inch wheels. A new side skirt extension runs through the rear and joins up with the diffuser and exhaust pipes. The interior is themed with soft microfiber and fabric covers, complete with contrast stitching on the steering wheel and shifter.
When the doors are opened, the TCR logo is projected on the ground, which is pretty slick.
Pricing & Availability
The plan is for the Golf GTI TCR Concept to enter production this year. VW did not disclose any pricing information.

2018/05/11,Global Summit On Autonomous Driving Returns To Detroit,"AutoSens, a global summit on autonomous driving, is returning to Detroit, Michigan starting on May 15th. Attendees, speakers, sponsors, and participants will leverage each other’s expertise during the event, which includes autonomous vehicle demonstrations, technical sessions, a full panel of expert speakers, and dozens of networking opportunities.
The event will happen May 15th through the 17th at the Michigan Science Center near the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History.
“AutoSens, in short, is a global engineering forum for the people who work on vehicle perception systems,” explained Robert Stead, Managing Director, Sense Media, the parent company of AutoSens. “That might be designing a component, coding software algorithms, deciding on how to build a complete system, quality assurance, testing or any number of other functions important in developing efficient, affordable, robust, and reliable systems to the high standards demanded by the auto industry.”
Strength In Numbers
Collaboration and creativity are the central themes of AutoSens, whereby professionals in the field are encouraged to share ideas and devise solutions to the biggest challenges facing future mobility.
“This is a fiercely competitive market, but all companies can benefit from a forum with a free exchange of ideas,” Stead said. “Of course people don’t come and give away all their trade secrets, but so often engineers across the supply chain are facing similar challenges, and by working together to solve some of those core problems, they can spend more time focusing on the real value-add IP at the cutting edge of research.”
Although networking is a major aspect of AutoSens, it’s not a trade show. Attendees will be in the middle of the action, surrounded by people immersed in the technology daily.
“The difference between AutoSens and many other events on this hot topic of self-driving cars is that the AutoSens attendees are the actual engineers who are building the systems that will make it all possible,” Stead continued. “They know first-hand what technologies work well, what the bottlenecks are, and what the future capabilities will be.”
Diverse & Encompassing
AutoSens also addresses supply chain challenges, regulations, testing and validation environments, and the various human factors involved in implementing autonomous driving. The human aspects are among the event’s defining moments. At AutoSens Brussels in September, Stead recalls an attendee who noted it was refresing to “take the gloves off for a couple of days and do good science with other engineers.”
“I think that sums it up pretty well,” he said. “It’s also a lot more fun if everyone has an open mind – I’ve been to events where it’s all about hard sales, or when all the technical folks are tight-lipped about what they are working on and it really doesn’t make for a great event. We are lucky to have some great Chairmen and Advisory Board members who set the tone.”

Something For Everyone
Even though AutoSens is geared toward the engineering and technical communities, one doesn’t necessarily have to be an engineer. Professionals in other fields who have clients in the automotive industry can benefit from AutoSens. Those working in the car industry, from the big city boardroom to the small town dealership, can benefit by attending.
“To be clear, this is a technical meeting with engineering presentations on leading edge research, but it’s also an accessible agenda top-and-tailed with plenary sessions that give some context to the deeper technical content,” Stead said. “Overall, I think any non-technical folks who are interested in what’s really going on in the autonomous vehicle technology space or need to know about it for their jobs will get some great value.”
Stead says there is no need to be shy and questions are always welcome.
“You’ll find the attendees, even if they are doing research on a niche technical area, will be very open to explain what it’s all about to those who are not so experienced,” he added.
Schedule & Agenda
On Tuesday May 15th, autonomous vehicle demonstrations will be conducted at nearby Wayne State University. Tuesday will also see a number of workshops, expert-led sessions, and roundtable discussions in the evening. On Wednesday and Thursday, May 16th and 17th, more expert speakers will take the stage while panel discussions both days will cover a range of topics from safety and privacy to technical innovations.
Two receptions are planned, including one at HopCat, a local Detroit favorite known for their enticing menu items.
“I’ve been missing the Crack Fries at HopCat,” Stead joked.
Speakers include representatives from Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Jaguar Land Rover, and major suppliers like Bosch, Valeo, and Magna. Representatives from MIT, Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, and the University of Michigan are also scheduled to speak.
Workshops include one on LiDAR – led by Dr. Mark McCord and Steve Vozar, co-founders of Cepton and May Mobility respectively – and one on image processing led by Dr. Rania Hussein, Electrical Engineering Lecturer at the University of Washington Bothell.
“We record all the presentations so they are available for attendees afterwards,” Stead said. “If there’s a clash of two presentations you want to see, you can catch up in high-resolution, picture-in-picture format later via AutoSens TV.”
Tickets & Attending
Tickets for AutoSens Detroit, including discount packages for females in the engineering community, are available now. The event’s full agenda can be found here.

2018/05/11,Aston Martin V12 Vantage V600: The Golden Eyes,"Back in 1998, the Aston Martin V8 Vantage V600 was (briefly) the most powerful car you could buy. And now, 20 years later, the Gaydon outfit has seen fit to resurrect the idea of the V600 with the limited run V12 Vantage V600. Impressive? Yes. Heavier than it should be? Also yes. Overthought styling? Of course, this is an Aston Martin. Worth it? Mos def!
Golden Eyes
Q by Aston Martin, the veddy British carmaker’s everso unique personalization service, accepted a customer commission for a limited run of 14 new Aston Martin V12 Vantage V600s. There will be seven coupes and seven roadsters produced, all 14 of them designed and handcrafted without compromise. AM calls it the Triple V, for some pretentious reason, but never fully explains why. My guess is that it has a V12, is called the V600, and is built on the previous-gen ‘VH’ Vantage.
The 2018 Aston Martin V12 Vantage V600 merges the modern performance, safety, and comfort features into what Aston calls a “muscle sportscar.” I’m not sure what that is but, honestly, sounds like something Detroit would say to convince you a Camaro is a real sports car (I also like how AM did it old school and called it a sportscar, one word).
Or, to put it another way: The V12 Vantage V600 is the ultimate analogue Vantage.
Power & Performance
Propelled by an upgraded version of Aston Martin’s already imposing six-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine, the Vantage V600 cranks out 600PS (effectively 600 ponies). Said mill is mated to a seven-speed manual transmission. I’ll say that again: a seven-speed manual transmission! Aston Martin says it “provides an engaged driving experience.” Ya think?
The thing is held up via a front and rear, dual independent wishbone suspension with three-stage adaptive damping that yields a beautiful ride in all conditions.
Exterior & Interior Treatments
To say the V12 Vantage V600 has a commanding road presence and aggressive styling is sort of like saying Mike Tyson comes across as slightly angrier than the Dalai Lama. The exterior is full-carbon fiber, and on the V600, utilizes a re-imagined side-strake referencing the 90s version. The big bulging on the hood hints towards the powerful engine contained within – guess that’s why they call them “power bulges” huh?
The gaping grille provides maximum air flow to the car’s engine, which is probably working right at the limits of thermal efficiency. At the back end there’s an all-new carbon fiber diffuser and an attention-getting quad exhaust system. Also setting the V600 apart from the rest of its siblings are bespoke center-lock forged and machined aluminum wheels.

The inside is accented, trimmed, and flourished with carbon fiber and dark anodized aluminum. The seats are lightweight and have an all-new perforation pattern. The center console is also carbon fiber and features bespoke driver information dials. The center armrest is even hand-crafted saddle leather.
Availability
If you’ve got the wherewithal (i.e. many, many, many Benjamins) the Aston Martin V12 Vantage V600 is available per your request with deliveries taking place in the third quarter of 2018.

2018/05/10,"The Hyundai LAFESTA Is An Alright Car, But The Marketing Could Use Some Work","Hey all you go-gettin’ red hot Chinese Millennials, Hyundai has got the car for you: LAFESTA (all caps)! This is a Chinese-market-only sedan that comes with enough marketing gibberish to choke a horse and enough sloganeering to make the Zhongxuanbu nod in quiet approval.
The vehicle made its debut recently at Auto China 2018 and here is what Hyundai had to say: “At the 2018 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition Hyundai premiered the LAFESTA. A car with a powerful driving performance packaged in stylish design.”
Then they added: “LAFESTA is a landmark addition to the aggressively expanding Hyundai line-up in China.”
Seriously, the press release is riddled with sayings like that.
Pop Quiz
Can you pick which ones were written by Hyundai Motor Company for the Beijing show:
1 – “LAFESTA embodies Hyundai’s new design philosophy, Sensuous Sportiness.”
2 – “Long live the 23rd of August, the great celebration of the LAFESTA.”
3 – “LAFESTA targets young generation looking for smart performance.”
4 – “All the best on the occasion of November 7th, followed by the slogan LAFESTA forever.”
If you thought numbers 2 and 4, you would be wrong, those are Romanian Communist Party slogans. Numbers 1 and 3, however, are direct quotes. Can this marketing strategy work? Even in a sellers market like China? I dunno, but we’re going to find out, because Hyundai is not slowing down.
LAFESTA, which, yeah, is the word for festival, or party, although Hyundai specifies they nicked it from the Italians. That’s an obvious nod to making the point of: SPORTY-SPORTY-SPORTY! Buy our car all you young hip sportsters in China! LAFESTA, according to the Korean auto manufacturer, is a “high-performance sporty sedan designed to meet the dynamic and passionate demands of a new mainstream generation from the 80s and 90s.”
See! See!
Power & Performance
The LAFESTA is a coupe-styled sedan with a fairly modern powertrain and a slew of innovative driving assistance systems. It’s propelled by a 1.6 turbo GDi engine that puts out an unspecified amount of power and torque. That giant, throbbing mill is mated to a seven-speed dual clutch transmmission for efficient gear changes.
The inside is said to be spacious and made from quality materials. The overall cockpit environment is driver-focused and designed to be engaging. Safety? Set your mind at ease, my friend: “the LAFESTA features the most advanced and safest driving assistance systems. Further details will be disclosed in due course.”
See? Doesn’t that make you feel safer already?
Jumbled Jargon
And that is about it for deets on the (maybe) 2019 Beijing Hyundai LAFESTA, but the fun doesn’t stop there. Did you think we were done with the slogans? No we are not comrade.

Read this: “Beijing Hyundai today reiterated its new Chinese market strategy slogan ‘Quality Hyundai, Smart Future’, which was first announced last year in its 15th anniversary in the Chinese market, as the company sets about to develop and embrace the new generation, rapidly developing in the Chinese market.”
Does that make sense to you? Is it supposed to make sense? Is there some sort of entraining rhythm to the gibberish that will eventually make me shoot Bobby Lembeck in the forehead? I don’t know, but there it is: “Quality Hyundai, Smart Future.”
Here’s what I want to know: What if this marketing plan (such as it is) actually works for Hyundai in China? Will they try and use it over here? On Us? Sheesh, that’s a bleak thought. But now you know, if you start seeing things like “Pringles Now, Happytime Tomorrow” or “Chevy Man, Chevy Strong” you can’t say I didn’t warn you.

2018/05/09,2019 Nissan Kicks Arrives: A Brief Walk Around,"The Nissan Kicks was unveiled during the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show as the sixth member of the company’s SUV and crossover lineup. Nissan’s sales in these segments are at an all-time high and the automaker hopes the Kicks will generate additional growth. Nissan customers who don’t need something bigger will likely find the new Kicks fits their lifestyle.
“The new Kicks is designed to fit the needs of singles or couples looking for expressive styling, personal technology, smart functionality, and advanced safety features at an affordable price,” explained Michael Bunce, Vice President, Product Planning, Nissan North America, Inc.
Power & Performance
The 2019 Nissan Kicks will pack a little punch with its standard 1.6-liter DOHC 16-valve four-cylinder. Complete with a Continuous Variable Valve Timing Control System, the engine generates 122 horsepower and 115 lb-ft. of torque. With an Xtronic transmission, the front-wheel drive Kicks achieves 33 mpg combined. All-wheel drive is not available.
In terms of audio performance, the 2019 Nissan Kicks will crank it up a notch! The SR Premium Package comes with a Bose Personal Plus sound system. The setup includes a pair of 2.5-inch UltraNearfield neodymium speakers inside the driver’s seat headrest.
Design Language
We’ve come to expect the V-Motion grille, a signature found on every Nissan today. The 2019 Kicks also features unique wheel arches, boomerang headlights and taillights, and a “floating” roof for a “wrap-around visor” look. There are seven different exterior colors and five two-tone schemes on offer, three of which utilize a black roof and contrasting body colors (white, orange, or red). An orange roof with a gray body, or a white roof with a blue body can also be had.
Interior Treatments
Nissan notes the “Gliding Wing” design of the dashboard, anchored by a seven-inch color display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Nissan says the new Kicks has one of the largest load areas in its class. The vehicle offers an EPA-rated 32.3 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down; and has an additional non-EPA-rated 21.8 cubic feet of cargo space in the trunk. In total, the Kicks provides families 53.1 cubic feet of usable cargo space.
“With its good ground clearance, high eye point, electric power steering, and small turning radius, Kicks is a great vehicle for both everyday and weekend adventures,” Bunce added.
Safety & Security
The Kicks comes standard with Automatic Emergency Braking, RearView Monitor, and seven air bags. SV and SR grades add Blind Spot Warning and Rear Cross Traffic Alert.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Nissan Kicks is available now and comes in three flavors: S, SV, and SR. The S begins at $18,540, the SV at $20,250, and the SR at $20,870. Tack on another $995.00 for destination and handling.

2018/05/09,Audi Vehicles Can “Talk” With Traffic Lights In Phoenix & Kansas City,"Traffic Light Information is now available in two more cities – Phoenix and areas of Kansas City, Kansas, Audi of America has announced. As of March, more than 600 intersections in the District of Columbia support Audi’s “time-to-green” feature of Traffic Light Information. The system falls under the category of “vehicle-to-infrastructure” technology, sometimes abbreviated as V2I. Traffic Light Information, an Audi connect PRIME feature available on certain late models, enables the vehicle to communicate with the infrastructure in metropolitan areas.
Expanding Network
In 2016, Audi, in collaboration with Traffic Technology Services launched Traffic Light Information in Las Vegas, later expanding it to the Dallas and Houston metros, along with Palo Alto and Arcadia, California, Portland, and Denver. With the addition of Washington D.C. earlier this year and now Phoenix and Kansas City, over 2,250 intersections across the United States support Traffic Light Information.
“Audi continues to be an industry leader in connectivity and mobility solutions,” said Scott Keogh, President, Audi of America. “Not only do V2I technologies like Traffic Light Information help to reduce driver stress, they are also essential infrastructure developments as we continue toward an automated future.”
How It Works
Vehicles equipped with the technology will receive real-time signals from connected traffic lights via the on-board 4G LTE data connection. When the light is red, the time remaining until the signal changes to green is displayed in the instrument cluster or heads-up display. The automaker says future iterations of this and other V2I technologies will be used to further enhance mobility and reduce congestion.
Audi’s Connect PRIME services are optional and may require an additional subscription with separate terms and conditions.

2018/05/08,Ford Is Pounding The Daylights Out of The New Ranger (Video),"Ford is pounding the tar out of the new Ranger, set to arrive early next year. In the last few years, midsize trucks have made quite the comeback, evidenced by the return of the Colorado and Canyon, and a redesigned Tacoma and Ridgeline. So naturally, the Blue Oval decided it was time to get back in the game, and even gave us a glimpse of the new Ranger at the North American International Auto Show in January.
In a new video, we see just what Ford is up to with the Ranger. As you watch it, you almost feel sorry for the truck. It really takes a beating.
Torture Test Theme
This is not the first time Ford has thrown knock out punches at their trucks. In 2011, the company filmed a series of “Torture Tests” to promote the 3.5 Ecoboost engine for the newly-redesigned F-150. The series, hosted by Mike Rowe, saw the trucks tackle a number of outrageous challenges, from hauling logs in the Pacific Northwest, to hauling you know what around Homestead-Miami Speedway with a loaded trailer.
Now the Ranger is receiving the same treatment as its older brother, and some of the tests are so intense, robotics are utilized because it’s simply too harsh for humans to endure!
“We torture every component – from its high-strength steel frame to its EcoBoost engine, to its cloth and leather-trimmed seats – to ensure Ranger is ready for any season and nearly any terrain,” said Rick Bolt, Chief Engineer, Ford Ranger.
Aggressive Approach
Ford’s rigorous, perhaps even nontraditional, approach to ensuring the Ranger’s capability starts in the lab, where the truck is subjected to a four-post shaker table. This contraption does exactly what it sounds like and is used, for days on end, to weed out any squeaks and rattles in the chassis. Testing then progresses to more intense, real-world challenges. The Ranger has been as far away as the Australian Outback and as close to home as the company’s Michigan Proving Grounds for various tests.
Davis Dam in Arizona is a prime location for testing, and Ford made an appearance there with the 2011 F-150 in the aforementioned videos. Similar to the F-150, the new Ranger is subjected to the high temperatures and steep grades of Davis Dam while towing trailer.
The video is below. While we are excited to see the truck when it’s finally released, we do have one question in the meantime? How do you get a job at Ford driving the Ranger for these tests?!

2018/05/07,BMW Teams With Virgin Hyperloop One For Dubai Hyperloop Passenger Capsule.,"They’ve rolled out the prototype design for a Dubai passenger capsule that will run in the desert fiefdom’s Virgin Hyperloop mag-lev high-speed “rail” system. I guess this means they’re serious, they being Hyperloop One, the United Arab Emirates as a country and, somehow, BMW, but when I see the words “passenger capsule” I am less than reassured.
“They” keep plugging away on this whole notion of a “hyperloop,” a vacuum tube, high-speed transit system using magnetic levitation/propulsion as the scheme to get from A to B. Sounds good. I like the idea, in general, and the engineering is quite fun.
Obstacles & Partnerships
It seems like the two biggest hurdles are land and money. Tearing up people’s property is never a good sales pitch, and building a hyperloop is not going to be cheap, but you know who has lots of empty land and bags of money? Dubai! So if you can overlook the problems with foreign workers and labor rights, religious freedom, freedom of expression, forced disappearances and torture, women’s rights, LGBT rights, and a horrendous zero tolerance drug policy, Dubai looks good!
Or at least it looked okay to Hyperloop One and BMW.
Virgin Hyperloop One says they are the only company with a fully operational hyperloop system. And yeah, that Elon Musk guy might quibble with that, but they are backed by some serious money from DP World, Caspian VC Partners, Abu Dhabi Capital Group, GE Ventures, and SNCF, yeah, the French TGV guys. BMW’s involvement is through their BMW Group Designworks creative consultancy biz. They’ve worked with Dassault Aviation, Embraer, Intermarine, BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), and they also did some really swoopy airplane interiors, so that fits in here too.
Challenges & Opportunities
Once Virgin Hyperloop One, the Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai (RTA), and BMW Designworks get their ducks in a row, the passenger capsule (shudder) will scoot from Dubai to Abu Dhabi (about 90 miles) in as little as 12 minutes via electromagnetic propulsion through a vacuum tube, reaching speeds up to 670 mph. They make no mention of the Gs you’d pull, either accelerating or when hitting the brakes, but let’s just go with this for now, shall we?
The main challenge for the Designworks team was creating a relaxing and engaging interior without any windows. Also, they say, “… a current requirement for passengers to be seated throughout the journey.” Ya don’t say? What, like passengers could stand?
Anyway, they’ve actually done this before, with a proposed design for an airliner’s interior sans windows. It worked pretty well as I remember, but nobody bought it. So, BMW’s Designworks had a crack at a very restrictive environment, or what could be that way, in a submarine-esque sense, and turned it into a “more personal and uplifting sensory experience that can be both memorable and enjoyable.”
RELATED
2020 Bentley Flying Spur: This Grand Tourer Is Still Grand
Or, to be more blunt about it, they had to figure out how to stuff people into a windowless vessel and blow it down a tube at airliner speeds without anyone croaking or going crazy.
Personal Attention & Cultural Influences
That sounds like a noble goal and all that, so how do you do it? First through multidirectional, personally-controlled lighting, digital displays, and premium comfort. This creates a sense of individualized space for each passenger. For example, in first class (what, you thought this would be a single class system) adjustable leather seats feature touchscreens with brightness and color settings, allowing you to shift the light from blue to pink to set your mood. The seats come with integrated heating and cooling and, thanks to the built-in displays, personalized entertainment.
BMW Designworks says this could “create a more sophisticated and user-centered spatial experience that transcends the typical utilitarian notion of public transportation.” Could? Your confidence is everso inspiring.
BMW Designworks also took inspiration from traditional Arabic patterns to create intentional cultural references. That’s an old trick, like how they used to decorate the China Clippers with scenes of the far off and mysterious “Orient” to get you in the mood. The overall design is secured in the cultural traditions of the UAE while alluding to the country’s achievements and ambitions.
Worldwide Implementation
Look, I’m a rare guy in the gearhead world. I actually like public transportation in general and, in this case, high speed “rail” in particular. I love driving, but a lot of people don’t, and public transportation is a great way to get those people off the roads and out of my way. I like the idea of this hyperloop deal, and you’ve got to test the prototypes somewhere, so why not the Dubai to Abu Dhabi run?
After they work out the kinks, they can install version 2.0 over here or anywhere else in the world.

2018/05/05,Inside The 2019 Lexus ES: Can It Compete With Germany?,"The latest Lexus ES recently debuted at Auto China 2018 in Beijing. That placement is significant, insofar as it is another example of just how important the Chinese market is for everyone these days. But it is also important because the ES has long been Lexus’ bread and butter in the performance sedan world.
Waxing Poetics
The Lexus ES is the Japanese car giant’s version of the BMW 3 Series, and very close in design goals to the vaunted M3. Apart from all the stuff that people negatively say about it – it’s soulless, it lacks personality, it’s not German etc. – the ES is a very good performance sedan option. Now, obviously, t’me this whole notion of “performance sedan” is borderline oxymoronic, but I understand that some people are okay with back seats and four doors and all that.
I empathize. And, with empathy, I can say that buying a Lexus ES never seems to be a bad choice.
Stance & Style
The new ES is longer (by 2.6 inches), lower (by .2 inches), and wider (by 1.8 inches) than before. The wheels are pushed nearer the corners for a two-inch longer wheelbase and wider tracks front (by .4 inches) and rear (by 1.5 inches). Sure, that will make a car look cooler, but that will get you grip in each direction: forward, side-to-side, and backward.
The seventh-generation ES has a “fast” roofline to emphasize its lower stance and slick aerodynamics. The rear goes for clean and sharply chiseled, with wraparound LED taillamps. The F SPORT models (Lexus’ answer to BMW’s M Division) have a rear spoiler, additional rear badging (natch), and a dark lower valance for a more sporty aspect. Also new are three different wheel designs: a standard 17-inch and two 18-inch wheels for the ES 350 and ES 300h, while the ES 350 F SPORT gets standard 19-inchers.
The new ES still has a bunch of those high reflectance, color-tint over chrome colors that I find quite striking. There are two new shades, Moonbeam Beige Metallic and Sunlit Green. F SPORT models get an exclusive Ultra Sonic Blue Mica 2.0 color.
Interior Treatments
The interior of the new ES is actually pretty flashy. The driver’s focus is kept on the road by placing the center display screen, instrument panel, and available heads-up display in a tight arrangement and in the driver’s field of view. Front passengers get an open and spacious environment, and despite the sleeker exterior roofline, rear passengers get plenty of comfort thanks to a lower hip point and a carefully configured headliner.

The cabin trim is an all-new kind of metallic finish developed to mimic the look of a traditional Japanese sword. They call it “Hadori” aluminum trim, and it has this groovy wave pattern to give it a three-dimensional appearance. The standard ES 350 and ES 300h will offer materials like Matte Bamboo, Linear Dark Mocha, and Linear Espresso wood to give the ES a hand-crafted appearance luxury buyers expect.
Tech & Safety
Contained within all this cool Japanese swordplay interior is enough tech and entertainment junk to keep a toddler occupied. The seventh-generation ES offers up Apple CarPlay, Siri Eyes Free voice control, and Amazon Alexa. There’s on-board Wi-Fi as part of the optional navigation system that includes a 12.3-inch wide dashboard display.
There’s also tons of on-board superfluous safety stuff that most blockheads will need.
Chassis & Suspension
The chassis is just as modern and high-tech as one would expect. Pinned to the new GA-K chassis platform are various grades of high-tensile steel to reduce weight, an all-new multi-link rear suspension, and rack-mounted electric power steering. F SPORT models offer an Adaptive Variable Suspension with adjustable dampers at each corner with 650 levels of damping.
Power & Performance
All ES 350s are powered by a 3.5-liter V6 that develops 302 horsepower and 267 lb-ft. of torque, both a bump from previous models. The ES 350 gets a new eight-speed Direct Shift automatic transmission that uses an ultra-thin torque converter and a multi-plate lock up clutch to efficiently transfer power to the front wheels (sadly).
The ES 300h comes with Lexus’ fourth-gen hybrid drive system, combining an Atkinson cycle 2.5-liter four-banger with a lighter, more compact, more power dense electric motor and self-charging hybrid system. Add those up, and you get 215 total system horsepower and a preliminary estimate of 44 mpg combined.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Lexus ES goes on sale in September with a base price of $39,500, a $550 increase over the outgoing model. The ES 300h starts at $41,310, a $510 decrease compared to its predecessor. The ES 350 F SPORT starts at $44,035.

2018/05/05,Mercedes-Benz Overcomes Having To Read The Owner’s Manual,"The owner’s manual, that collection of writings concealed forever in the glovebox, might now be destined for the great hall of automotive fossils. It used to be sound advice: when getting a new car, read the owner’s manual. Does anybody do that anymore? Seems unlikely today.
In a “get with the times, man” approach, Mercedes-Benz last year revealed a pilot program called “Ask Mercedes.” The program allows customers to explore and learn about their Benz’s features with augmented reality technology that supplements a camera image with computer-generated content.
What a time to be alive.
Mercedes Matrix
Through the augmented reality program, customers receive information in real time, without having to decipher the archaic texts within a paper-inspired operator’s manual. Owners of a 2018 E-Class or S-Class (non-AMG) use the application to “get to know their vehicle.” The automaker says by using a smartphone camera, owners can “discover interior features and functions by scanning controls and displays.”
Say the phone camera is aimed at the dashboard, steering wheel or center console – that’s when augmented reality beacons are automatically superimposed onto the controls and displays shown in the camera image. Clicking or taping on a beacon further explains the function by way of text, photos, and video. Customers can even directly link to that section of a digital owner’s manual if they want more information.
Practical Uses
This feature would be handy for a complex navigation system, an odd-looking “what’s that do” button, or as a refresher that turn signals are there for a reason. Seriously, point the camera at the little blinker switch just off the steering wheel, then watch the instructional video on how to use it.
If you have questions, follow this procedure: access the “junk and stuff” drawer in the kitchen, usually populated with an assortment of pens, pill holders, batteries, rubber bands, tape, etc. Remove scissors. Open wallet. Remove driver’s license. Hold both scissors and license over medium-sized trash can. Proceed to operate scissors until driver’s license has been successfully committed inside the trash receptacle.
Availability & Expansion
The pilot of “Ask Mercedes” launched late last year, with the augmented reality functions first available for the 2018 E-Class. The company says the recently added capabilities for the 2018 S-Class will gradually expand in the coming months to other models. “Ask Mercedes” is available in the Apple App Store and is supported on the iPhone 6 running iOS 10 or higher.
“We are creating a personalized customer experience that goes well beyond the vehicle,” explained Britta Seeger, member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales. “With innovative services such as ‘Ask Mercedes’ we are further expanding our digital ecosystem.”

2018/05/05,The Brabham BT62 Might Have Just Declared War On Everyone,"Well this is a nasty looking piece of kit right here. Greetings to the new Brabham BT62. Yes, it is (sadly) a track-only car, but what a car it is. The last time something with “Black” Jack Brabham’s name on it turned up on a track, it was a bad day for the opposition. If the BT62 holds true to form, and you drive a Ferrari FXX or a McLaren P1 or Senna, you’re right to be worried.
Jack Attack
To get you up to speed here, and I feel sorry for those that have not heard the stories, Jack Brabham was an Australian racer and race car builder from the mid-century. First guy to race a mid-engined car at the Indy 500? Jack Brabham. First (and so far only) guy to win a grand prix championship in a car he built himself? Jack Brabham. First Australian GP winner? Jack Brabham. First Australian GP World Champion? Jack Brabham. Guy who snapped a throttle cable at Zandvoort, drove off to the side, and used wire from a fence to build a hand throttle and finish the race? Jack Brabham.
He got the nickname “Black” Jack because of his racing style: fast, uncompromising, declarative, and if you dropped your guard an inch, Brabham was through. Try to mess him up on the track, and he’d be on you like a leather sack filled with buckshot; a Blackjack. He also had the best motto: “When the green flag drops, the bullshit stops.” In other words, you can talk a big game all you want, and you’re car can look as impressive as they come sitting in the pits, but when the race starts, all that hot air is done away with and then we’ll know who is the quickest.
And the brand new BT62? How does that fare? Dunno yet, haven’t seen it run. But the specs? Hoo boy!
No Nonsense Nomenclature
This is all David Brabham’s deal. He would be Jack’s son, former racer, Le Mans winner, current and future Australian, and, like his pop, a nice guy (unless you cross him on the track). The Brabham BT62 – the B stands for Brabham and the T for Ron Tauranac, Jack’s engine builder/chassis designer/chief engineer from back in the day – boasts a power-to-weight ratio of 720 horsepower per ton, a dry weight of just 2,142 lbs., and is propelled by a Brabham naturally-aspirated 5.4-liter V8.
That’s right, they are even building their own V8 plant in-house. You think this is a kit car? Slow and stupid, ain’t ya?
RELATED
2020 Audi A5: This Hot Tamale Is Still Smokin'
Power & Performance
Like all Brabhams before it, the BT62 is designed from the ground up to be simple, robust, reliable, flexible, and fast. A complete “clean sheet of paper” design, the Brabham BT62 is mid-engined, with the power driving the rear wheels via a rear-mounted dog-box transmission. Like I said, the BT62 tips the scales around 2,140 lbs. (think Miata) and possesses a strong power-to-weight ratio. That Brabham-built V8 engine cranks out 700 plus horsepower and 492 ft-lb. of torque. Add to the mix the BT62’s aggressive aerodynamic package, which delivers over 2,600 lbs. of downforce, and you can see where this is heading.
If it’s heading there too fast, not to worry, the carbon/carbon disc brakes with six-piston calipers front and rear will “whoa” you up. The BT62 is shod with Michelin racing slick tires and, to make maters worse for those of you racing against it, Brabham Automotive is a technical partner with Michelin and further developing racing tires.
Avenged Seventyfold
Of course they are not making very many of them. The Brabham BT62 will be limited to just 70 cars to celebrate the 70 years since Sir Jack Brabham (oh yeah, The Queen gave him a Knighthood a while back) launched his racing career in Australia in 1948. The first 35 cars will be liveried just like the F1 cars in that delicious green and gold paint scheme. And, as the owner of a Brabham BT62, you also gain entry into a tailored driver development and experience program to enable you to “fully exploit the performance potential of this exceptional car.”
In other words, you get driving school along with your purchase.
Speaking of: How much? Base price of £1m or 1.4 million bucks or about the same as dedicated track cars from Ferrari, McLaren, and such. First deliveries are expected later this year.
War On Everyone
The only thing I dislike about the Brabham BT62 is that you can’t hang a license plate on it. But what I really love about it is this sentence from the press materials: ” . . . the company’s ultimate goal is to see the iconic Brabham name return once again to compete on the race track, with the 24 Hours of Le Mans firmly in its sights.”
What’s that old phrase? Those who do not remember history are doomed to get beaten like a drum on the race track . . . something like that.

2018/05/04,Toyota Research Institute Building Autonomous Vehicle Test Track In Michigan,"The Toyota Research Institute (TRI) has filed construction permits for a 60-acre site at Michigan Technical Resource Park (MITRP) in Ottawa Lake. TRI is planning a closed-course test facility for the development of autonomous vehicle technology. If all goes according to schedule, it will open in October.
“By constructing a course for ourselves, we can design it around our unique testing needs and rapidly advance capabilities, especially with the Toyota Guardian automated vehicle mode,” explained Ryan Eustice, TRI Senior Vice President of Automated Driving.
Edge Cases
The TRI facility will reside inside MITRP’s 1.75-mile oval test track. It will include congested urban environments, slick surfaces, and a four-lane divided highway with high-speed entrance and exit ramps. The idea is to replicate “edge case” scenarios, or situations still too dangerous to attempt on public roads.
“This new site will give us the flexibility to customize driving scenarios that will push the limits of our technology and move us closer to conceiving a human-driven vehicle that is incapable of causing a crash,” Eustice added.
Officials say this new site expands TRI’s testing capabilities and builds on partnerships with GoMentum Station in California, Mcity, and the American Center for Mobility in Michigan. TRI is leasing the land from MITRP and will be responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility.
“We are very excited about the partnership with TRI,” said Mike Jones, President of MITRP. “We believe that this relationship will be a proven winner.”
Research & Development
The MITRP site has been a vehicle proving ground since 1968 and was sold in 2010 to a private developer. The 336-acre technology park is now available to automotive, commercial, and mobile off-highway vehicle manufacturers and suppliers for testing, engineering, and technology development.
TRI presented Platform 3.0 earlier this year in Las Vegas. Built on the Lexus LS 600hL, Platform 3.0 is Toyota’s latest autonomous research vehicle.

2018/05/04,Older Brother Does Something With His Life: 2019 Chevy Suburban RST Performance Package,"These days American automotive shoppers are hungry for two things: SUVs and special editions of those SUVs. Meet the Chevy Suburban with the new RST Performance Package. It’s old school thinking combined with new ideas: the big SUV, big engine part is old school and the new ideas? Well, that comes from the modern styling that befits the RST Performance Package.
The Suburban’s little brother, the Tahoe, already has an RST Performance Package. It has for a year. Every family has that annoying overachiever, but now the Suburban is off the couch and more than just marginally employed.
Here are the details, starting with the old school.
Power & Performance
This whale swims through urban oceans and concrete seas with a 6.2-liter V8 engine and 10-speed automatic transmission. GM fans seem to love the 6.2 and it rarely needs an introduction. Pedal down equals vehicle forward. The current Suburban is only offered with the 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 (still a good engine) but the RST Performance Package pours on the gravy as the 6.2 churns out an impressive 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. of torque.
Towing capacity is expected to be 8,100 lbs. although that figure is not official yet.
The engine and transmission work in unison for an optimum balance of power and efficiency. The 6.2 utilizes direct injection, continuously variable valve timing, and Active Fuel Management while the transmission has smaller steps between each ratio to maximize acceleration. The 10-speed also features a wide 7.39 overall gear ratio spread and lower numerical top gear ratio.
Magic Carpets
This is a bit on the new school side, although GM’s Magnetic Ride Control has been around for a hot minute. Magnetic Ride Control is an active suspension that “reads” the road every millisecond, triggering damping changes in the electronically controlled shock absorbers in as few as five milliseconds. In other words, it’s a proactive approach to dealing with harsh or bumpy roads.
Magnetic Ride Control provides greater control, especially around corners, and will make being on a long trip much more comfortable.
“When you want to hustle, the Suburban RST with the Performance Package offers high levels of acceleration, braking, and road-holding grip,” said Eric Stanczak, Chief Engineer for Chevrolet full-size trucks. “When you want to relax, it is very refined, with exceptional ride comfort and interior quietness.”
Styling Themes
The Performance Package eliminates most of the chrome to mirror a look consistent with current aftermarket trends. Styling is more body-color-oriented and matched: grille surround and door handles, for example; the gloss-black grille and mirror caps; black roof rails, window trim, badging, and Chevy bowties. Less chrome for a different kind of shine. Some say it’s more bold, others say it’s more subtle. It’s really up to you.

The Suburban RST can be further decked out with a Borla custom exhaust system, Brembo brakes, 22-inch wheels, and Bridgestone P285/45R 22 tires. Go big or go home right?
Pricing & Availability
Chevy did not announce pricing but said to expect the Suburban RST Performance Package later this summer. Complete performance specs, like the towing capacity, will be announced closer to that time.

2018/05/03,2019 Mazda CX-3 Arrives: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2019 Mazda CX-3 is on its way, complete with refinements that, according to the automaker, enhance performance and efficiency. Overall, we have enjoyed the previous models of the CX-3, finding them comfortable and fun to drive. We have every reason to believe the 2019 will be the same.
Here is a brief look at what to expect when the new CX-3 arrives.
Standard Equipment
Mazda packed the 2019 CX-3 with a number of standard features. Even the entry-level Sport comes with a tire pressure monitoring system, Blind Spot Monitoring, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, Bluetooth capability, push-button start, two USB ports, and a rearview camera. Inside, a seven-inch color screen gives the driver control over the functions and displays.
Trim Levels
The mid-level CX-3 Touring includes 18-inch wheels, keyless entry, heated mirrors, automatic on/off LED headlights, automatic climate control, and rain-sensing wipers. The Touring features black leatherette seating surfaces with three-level heating adjustments for the front seats, and a leather shift knob and steering wheel.

The Grand Touring provides full-leather seating surfaces with high-gloss, pleated piping, a heads-up display, navigation, and a moonroof. Exterior features include LED headlights, fog lights, and daytime running lights, with chrome accents on the front bumper and side sills.
Safety & Security
The new Sport i-ACTIVSENSE Package adds Advanced Smart City Brake Support with Pedestrian Detection, Smart Brake Support, Mazda Radar Cruise Control with Stop & Go function, Lane Departure Warning, High Beam Control, and an Adaptive Front-lighting System. Smart City Brake Support is standard on every CX-3.
In other words, a boatload of safety features.
Power & Performance
The 2019 CX-3 features a SKYACTIV-G 2.0-liter engine, paired with a SKYACTIV-DRIVE six-speed automatic transmission with manual-shift and sport modes. Mazda says the engine was turned for refinement and efficiency, and puts out 148 horsepower (6,000 rpm) and 146 lb-ft. torque (2,800 rpm). Front-wheel drive is standard although all-wheel drive is available on every trim level.
The automaker’s signature G-Vectoring Control improves ride and handling, and compliments the re-calibrated power steering and chassis.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Mazda CX-3 arrives at dealerships nationwide this month. The CX-3 Sport with front-wheel drive begins at $20,390; $21,790 with all-wheel drive. The Touring starts at $22,475 (front-wheel drive) or $23,875 (all-wheel drive). The Grand Touring in front drive goes for $25,745, or $27,145 in all-wheel drive.

2018/05/03,Jaguar XE SV Project 8: Look Out Everyone! (Especially Germans),"Alright all you Bahn-burners, Merc pilots, Beemer drivers, and Audi flyers, Jaguar is here to say, “Not so fast, chaps!” The Jaguar XE SV Project 8 aims to be the veddy British, veddy quick answer to “Who builds the world’s fastest sedan?” And with a 200 mph top speed and a Nürburgring Nordschleife lap time in the low 7:20s, you Germans best listen up.
Jaguar Special Vehicle Operations is putting the finishing touches on the soon-to-be-released XE SV Project 8, “the fastest and most thrilling of all road-legal four-door sedans.” Let’s just take that as a factual statement for now, and leave the fuming and raging you can hear emanating from Germany as distant thunder to be dealt with later.
Bolder & Badder
The Project 8 is a big, four-door sedan with a zero to 60 time of just 3.4 seconds. That’s impressive, given how large and heavy these cats are. They weigh just under 3,900 lbs. (after going on a significant diet) and are over 15 feet long. No one is going to mistake this for a Lotus, but that made little difference to the stopwatch when the Jaguar XE SV Project 8 sedan set a lap time of 7 minutes 21.23 seconds at the Nordschleife, quicker than the old four-door record by more than 10 seconds.
Overcoming all that heft and size is a 592 horsepower version of the “normal” supercharged Jaguar 5.0-liter V8, making the XE SV Project 8 the most powerful Jaguar road car to date. That big powerplant lives in a car peppered with genuine motor racing technology, a flat underbody, a differential oil cooler, and an all-wheel drive system that puts the power to the lane. The ride height, camber, front splitter, and rear wing are all adjustable. Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 road-legal track tires wrap the forged 20-inch wheels with ceramic wheel bearings similar to those in grand prix cars. Impressive.
Building The Beast
The high-tech racing stuff doesn’t stop there. There are two-part upper wishbones, ball joints in place of rubber bushings, twin coil springs, special dampers and lower suspension bushings, a rollover protection system, and the latest spec carbon ceramic brakes: all new and all bespoke to the XE SV Project 8. The only body components used from the standard XE are the aluminum roof and aluminum front door skins. The vented hood, flared front fenders, and bumpers are made from carbon fiber. Driver feel is up, according to Jaguar, and the handling response is sharper.
“Power delivery and gear shifts are the most visceral we have ever offered on a Jaguar – every 1/100th of a second improvement in shift time adds up over a complete lap of the Nürburgring,” said Mark Stanton, Special Vehicle Operations Director. “Rest assured, no stone has been left unturned in our mission to make this the most rewarding Jaguar driver’s car ever.”

2020 Hyundai Venue: Practical & Efficient; Did Hyundai Hit a Homer?
With no more than 300 being made, each one will be hand-built at the company’s Technical Center in Coventry.
“The good thing about building only 300 cars, all hand-made, is that you can keep developing the car right up to the start of production,” said David Pook, Project 8 Vehicle Dynamics Manager. “And we’ve done just that. The springs have got stiffer and so have the engine mounts. The suspension arm bushes have changed. The brakes have been refined for the exact pedal feel and performance we want. This has all been done to make the car even more responsive and to handle even better.”
Pricing & Availability
Two versions of the Project 8 are available globally. The four-seat version coming to North America contains all the Motorsport tech, but outside the U.S., there is a two-seat Track Pack version that drops almost 27 lbs. and includes carbon fiber racing seats, a four-point safety harnesses, and a boost in torsional rigidity by 27 percent. But like I said, that is not to be our version over here in the states. More’s the pity.
The XE SV Project 8 is priced from $187,500. No, that’s not cheap, but most likely worth it.

2018/05/03,2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback: Marketing Jargon For Days,"Wait, what year is this, 1985? Toyota is trumpeting their new hatchback? People still make hatchbacks as separate and notable things? I thought having a hatch out back is just what a car company does these days, what makes this 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback special?
So, yeah, “the Hatch is back!” as Toyota claimed in a far too smarmy and familiar tone that, along with hideously contorted marketing prose, permeates their press materials.
Waxing Poetics
Toyota, in print anyway, is trying as hard as that third rate high school Romeo to convince you to go to prom with him. And there’s something about trying too hard that just seems to make it all the worse. Just check out this one single paragraph:
“Corolla Hatchback has flair extraordinaire. With a theme of Shooting Robust, along with a design goal of Agile, influencing their every pen stroke, designers created a form that is simultaneously distinct, dynamic, muscular, and sophisticated. Shooting references the design’s sport coupe traits implemented in all facets.”
Flair extraordinaire, Shooting Robust, design goal of Agile. Great job guys, you’ve now actively made me not want to buy your product. The only thing the marketing geeks have going for them is the complete and total lack of exclamation points. A minor blessing, all in all.
Enhanced Stance
In a lot of ways, the 2019 Corolla Hatchback is pretty much all that its name implies. It’s small, flexible, and a Corolla. Ergo, it’s going to be solid, dependable, easy-to-use transportation, and all the extra marzipan slathered on top just hides more of the cake underneath. The 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback is built on the company’s TNGA C platform, described as a compact structure that utilizes adhesives, spot welding, and additional bracing – top to bottom and side to side – for better stability and fuel economy.
The Corolla Hatchback is lower (by 0.4 inches), wider (by 0.6 inches), and shorter (by 0.6 inches) than its predecessor, the Corolla iM. That all adds up to better grip and handling, smother ride, and more room inside. The hatch itself is made from this stuff called TSOP and ABS plastic. TSOP, in case you’re interested, is not a reference to the disco song, The Sound of Philadelphia, but instead means Toyota Super Olefin Polymer, which is a new, lightweight substance. Put it on a sports car, and we can talk more Toyota.
Exterior & Interior Treatments
The little Corolla Hatch comes in two flavors, SE and XSE. Either version gets you LED headlamps and taillights, a chrome rear diffuser, and alloy wheels. The XSE’s wheels are 18-inchers while other goodies include LED fog lights, a chrome front grille surround, and an Adaptive Front Lighting System. Your color choices are Blizzard Pearl, Silver Metallic, Midnight Black, Galactic Aqua Mica, Scarlet, Oxide Bronze, and the new-for-2019 color Blue Flame.

2020 Nissan Rogue Sport: Brief But Detailed Walk Around
The interior is all about “Sensuous Minimalism.” No, seriously, that’s what they said. There’s a standard eight-inch multimedia touchscreen for vehicle settings, audio controls, navigation, smartphone integration, and the Entune 3.0 apps. The center tray ahead of the gearshift holds small items and has a wireless device charging area. Front door cup holders accommodate 24-ounce bottles and the rear door cup holders accommodate 16-ounce bottles, because America.
The XSE ups the ante with dual-zone climate control, leather seating, and heated front seats (yay!). A seven-inch TFT Multi-Information Display shows vehicle info, turn-by-turn navigation, and various vehicle settings like Lane Departure Alert, Lane Tracing Assist, Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Blind Spot Monitor and that sort of junk.
Power & Performance
All of this is propelled a 2.0-liter Dynamic-Force (laugh!) inline four-cylinder plant with direct injection. The engine is smaller and lighter than the 1.8-liter four-cylinder it replaces, and puts out 168 horsepower and 151 lb-ft. of torque. The chassis seems to be all parts bin sourced and bean counter approved with a front MacPherson strut setup and a multi-link suspension with stabilizer bars out back.
Here is how Toyota describes it in their press materials:
The end result: A Corolla Hatchback that possesses an uncanny blend of balance, composure, and feel that’ll have its driver pining for windy roads – time and time again.
Really? Who cares?! Just listen to that media hype. Tell people you “drive a hatchback.” Toyota thinks that’s what all the cool kids will be interested in anyway. The chassis and powerplant engineers at Ferrari certainly won’t be upset or worried by what the cool kids are doing.

2018/05/02,Magna & Innoviz Technologies To Supply BMW Group With LiDAR,"Magna and Innoviz Technologies will supply BMW Group with solid-state LiDAR solutions as the automaker moves toward autonomous vehicle production. LiDAR, because of its range and accuracy, is considered an essential element for autonomous cars. The venture is among the first of its kind, moving solid-state LiDAR technology away from something seen only on prototype and concept vehicles to full production cars.
Comprehensive Solutions
Magna officials say they reamin committed to flexible, scalable solutions that turn advancements like LiDAR into automotive-grade products. Magna, a global automotive supplier with a presence in 28 countries, has the ability to create a completely autonomous platform, or provide individual building blocks of the overall system, as is the case with BMW. Magna worked with Innoviz Technologies to deliver a viable solution for BMW’s future autonomous vehicles.
“We value the opportunity to support a premier brand such as BMW with our innovative technologies in sensors and systems,” explained Kelei Shen, President of Magna Electronics. “Our strong systems and integration knowledge and complete vehicle expertise give us the ability to provide scalable solutions for different levels of autonomy.”
“BMW is setting a high standard in autonomous vehicle development, and their vote of confidence in our LiDAR demonstrates how advanced our technology is,” added Omer Keilaf, co-founder and CEO of Innoviz. “The Innoviz and Magna teams collaborated to meet BMW requirements in quality and validation and functional safety.”
Invaluable Experiences
Innoviz has unique origins, being founded by former members of the elite technological unit of the Israeli Defense Forces. The company’s leaders and employees are experts in electro-optics, computer vision, MEMS design, and signal processing among other disciplines. In the military, Keilaf’s team was tasked with complex projects and tight deadlines, working around the clock to implement new technologies in service to their country.
“I come from a small unit but we were developing very unique hardware and technology – it’s like if MIT had an army,” he told us in a September 2017 feature. “You had to manage sometimes hundreds of people working on a certain project, and all of them needed to see something at the end that works perfectly.”
The experiences in the military inevitably shaped Innoviz and their success as a company. Today, they are backed by strategic partners and top-tier investors like Aptiv (Delphi), Magna International, Samsung Catalyst, SoftBank Ventures Korea, 360 Capital Partners, Glory Ventures, and Naver. The company’s LiDAR technology will benefit future BMW owners by functioning in the most challenging environments, like bright and direct sunlight or varying and unpredictable weather conditions.

“Automakers have been looking for a LiDAR technology provider to deliver a mass-market solution, and we are proud to see our product coming to series production,” Keilaf said.
Diverse Portfolio
Magna has been developing and manufacturing advanced driver assistance systems for automakers for nearly two decades. In August the company unveiled MAX4, a fully integrated and scalable platform that can enable up to Level 4 autonomous driving in both urban and highway environments. MAX4 contains radar, LiDAR, cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and an ADAS central computing module which can be supplied in part or as a whole system.
The company specializes in body exteriors, seating systems, and power and vision technologies among others. Magna’s common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (MG) and the New York Stock Exchange (MGA).

2018/05/01,"Toyota Invests In Mississippi Plant, New Facilities & Jobs Planned","With spring in the air, all sorts of plants are beginning to grow and that includes plants of the automotive manufacturing variety. This is the case in Blue Springs, home to Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Mississippi, where the automaker has committed $170 million for production of the new Corolla using a platform called “Toyota’s New Global Architecture” or TNGA.
The plant currently produces 170,000 vehicles annually and employs over 1,500 people.
Essential Foundations
TNGA improves Toyota vehicle performance in virtually every category while advancing and streamlining the company’s product development process. The monies will be used for a complete overhaul and replacement of the current production lines, a move Toyota officials say enables the facility to stay competitive globally.
“We will be able to respond quicker and be more flexible in order to meet market demands down the road,” explained Sean Suggs, Toyota Mississippi President. “Toyota knows that you have to put in the effort to get the results, and this is just the beginning of that effort.”
Continued Growth
Toyota says the investment will create 400 plus new jobs over the course of the next year. This recent commitment is the latest in Toyota’s effort to invest $10 billion in its U.S. facilities over the next five years, and brings the current total to $4.27 billion. Toyota’s total investment in the U.S. over the past 60 years is $25 billion, with more than a billion of that going to Mississippi since 2007.
“For more than a decade, Toyota has been a valued corporate partner to Blue Springs and the state of Mississippi,” said Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant. “Toyota’s commitment to building a sense of community is illustrated by the company’s continued investment in its operations and philanthropic efforts throughout the region.”
“I’m very proud of our team members and the partnerships we have developed across the state,” Suggs added. “These jobs will support production of the all-new Corolla, and we are excited to build more of them for our loyal customers.”
Visitor & Training Center
Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Mississippi also held a groundbreaking ceremony for a new visitor and training center designed by local architecture firm JBHM. The 15,000-square-foot facility will include meeting and training spaces for up to 120 people with state-of-the-art audio-visual technology. A 5,000-square-foot area with interactive exhibits that showcase Toyota’s Production System and Mississippi’s economic development are also planned.
The visitor and training center will open to the public in November 2019.

2018/05/01,Subaru of America Delivers Nine-Millionth Vehicle To Arkansas Doctor,"Subaru of America, Inc. recently hit a milestone, selling their nine-millionth vehicle in the United States. Adventure Subaru in Fayetteville, Arkansas earned the distinction after delivering a new Crosstrek to Dr. Hershey Garner. At the dealership, Garner was greeted by Don Nelms, owner of Adventure Subaru, along with staff and Ali Daniel and Brian Wilson from Subaru of America.
The celebration came as a surprise for Dr. Garner and his wife Denise, who are loyal Subaru customers. The good doctor proudly owns a 2005 Baja but admits he was taken by the new Crosstrek.
“I’ve been waiting for the right Subaru to come along and found the perfect one on Adventure Subaru’s website, the 50th Anniversary Edition Crosstrek,” he said. “It has all the features I was looking for, and the color and size are the perfect fit.”
Community Pillars
Dr. Garner has specialized as a radiation oncologist for over 30 years and supports Circle of Life Hospice by filling in as a staff physician. Denise Garner has served on the board of Feed Communities, one of Adventure Subaru’s Share the Love local charity recipients. The Garners were presented with several gifts and a charitable donation on their behalf to Feed Communities.
The couple champions public radio and donated the music room at the local NPR-affiliate KUAF.
Adventure Subaru is also active in community outreach and environmental stewardship and has been a certified Subaru Eco-Friendly Retailer since 2012.
Continued Growth
The Crosstrek is coming off its best March ever for sales with an 88.2 percent increase over the same month in 2017. March also marked the first time that Crosstrek has topped 13,000 units in a single month, marking Subaru of America’s 49th consecutive month of 40,000 plus vehicle sales.
All 2018 Crosstreks are powered by a revised version of the company’s 2.0-liter Boxer engine that creates 152 horsepower. The Crosstrek delivers 23 in the city, 29 on the highway, and 25 combined miles per gallon according to the EPA ratings.

2018/04/30,Volvo S90 Ambience Concept: Magic Carpet Ride,"“In England and Europe, we have this huge music called ambient – ambient techno, ambient house, ambient hip-hop, ambient this, ambient that,” said Brian Eno, who knows more than a thing or two about ambience. And now, it would seem, we have ambient cars, or at least it will be that way if Volvo has any say about it.
The car in question would be the Volvo S90 Ambience Concept. It is, literally, an industry-first sensory experience that synchronizes visuals, sound and – I’m not making this up – scent to “redefine in­-car luxury.”
Okay, that sounds fine, in a way. Not sure what that could offer me as a driver personally, since my preferred automotive ambience is blurring scenery, red-lining engines, and the fine bouquet of unburned fuel and tire smoke.
Aladdin’s Lamp
Volvo’s S90 Ambience Concept made its public debut at the 2018 Beijing Auto Show (ah-ha!, I sense a trend). The S90 Ambience Concept is based on Volvo’s top­-of­-the-­line S90 Excellence, which is a kinda-odd, three-seater executive sedan thing that focuses on the chauffeured passengers in the rear seat. Which, given the ambience deal, makes much more sense. The Gothenburg Guys tell us passengers can personalize the atmosphere by using a smartphone app to choose one of seven visual themes that synchronize with audio and scent. I know some guys that were trying to work on that same sort of system in their VW Bus that was equipped with a Radio Shack color organ, a Steppenwolf 8-track, and a hookah. Anyway . . .
Mind Trip
The visual part of the Volvo S90 Ambience Concept happens on the headliner, where the car’s ceiling is transformed to the selected theme: Northern Lights, Scandinavian Forest (of course), Swan Lake, Archipelago, and Rain. There is also a Nocturnal theme for chilling and the Freedom theme aims to give you a boost of fresh and uplifting energy. Synchronized audio plays through a Bowers and Wilkins sound system that includes small tweeters in the headrest for an immersive experience.
And to top it all off, each theme is complemented with one of four bespoke scents, created by Byredo (I don’t know either), which deploys simultaneously from a portal in the center console.
Continued Growth & Expansion
Volvo says the S90 Ambience is launching as a concept but are considering making it available in S90 Excellence production cars in China. And indeed, China is the whole point here. In 2017 alone, Volvo sold more than 100,000 cars in China. That’s the company’s fourth consecutive year of record sales and growth in The Forbidden Kingdom. China is Volvo Cars’ single largest market and the company’s biggest for the S90 sedan.

“The Ambience Concept was created primarily for the China market and provides a contrast to China’s sometimes hectic city environments,” said Martin Andersson, Senior Commercial Product Manager at Volvo Cars’ Special Vehicles Department. “The S90 Ambience Concept will reinforce our premium brand values in this important region.”
Or, to quote Per Olaf Gunderssen, Volvo Senior V.P. of Ambience and Good Vibes, “I like to dream, yes, yes. Right between the sound machine. On a cloud of sound I drift in the night. Any place it goes is right. Goes far, flies near. To the stars away from here.” Then he broke into a 4:39 drum solo. Okay, I made that up.
But what is true is that Volvo is Paying Attention to the Chinese market in a big way and seem to have no problem specializing their output to meet that market’s needs.

2018/04/28,2019 Honda Fit Arrives: A Brief Walk Around,"The 2019 Honda Fit has arrived at dealerships nationwide. The lineup is expansive with options to fancy every taste, from the entry-level LX to the EX-L with Navigation at the top of the mountain. Drivers wanting something a little more spunky will likely enjoy the new Fit Sport trim. We took the Fit Sport on a spin recently and thought it had ample interior room, a quiet ride, and solid overall performance.
Extensive Updates
For 2019, Auto High-Beams are added to Honda Sensing-equipped models, and a new Platinum Pearl White replaces White Orchid Pearl. Updates last year included retuned suspension dampers, a new acoustic glass windshield, and improved insulation throughout the vehicle.
More efficient packaging, such as the fuel tank being mounted underneath the front seats, provides 52.7 cubic-feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded down. Honda says this figure is class-leading.
Power & Performance
The 2019 Honda Fit features a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection that creates 130 horsepower and 114 lb-ft. of torque. Two transmissions are available: a six-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). EPA fuel economy ratings are 29/36/31 (city/highway/combined) for the manual and 33/40/36 for the CVT.
Safety & Security
The Honda Sensing package is available for the CVT-equipped LX and Sport models but standard on every EX and EX-L. Honda Sensing includes collision and road departure mitigation and warning systems, lane keeping assist technology, and Adaptive Cruise Control among others. Honda says the Fit was designed to achieve a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Technology & Comfort
All 2019 Fit models receive a rearview camera and Bluetooth capability; Sport models and above see Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration through a seven-inch touchscreen and a 180-watt six-speaker audio system. The Fix EX has push button start, satellite radio, and even a moonroof, while the EX-L adds heated, leather-trimmed seats and heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals.
Pricing
The 2019 Honda Fit starts at $17,080 for the LX with the manual transmission or $17,880 for the CVT. The Sport starts anywhere from $18,390 to $20,190 depending on options. The EX starts at $19,050 for the manual or $19,850 for the CVT. The EX-L comes in at $21,140 while the EX-L with Navigation beeps across the scanner for $22,140.
2019 Fits for the U.S. market are manufactured at Honda’s Celaya, Mexico plant.

2018/04/27,Inside The Volkswagen I.D. R Pikes Peak,"Racing improves the breed. That is a known truth in both horse and automotive racing. I have long maintained the best way to improve and market electric cars is to race them. It looks like Volkswagen has heard my pleas, because they’ve just rolled out this nasty looking, all-electric race car to have a crack at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.
Fearless Few
The Pikes Peak race, for those of you bereft of this knowledge, is one of the last “You’re going to die!! You’re crazy!!” racing events on the planet. It’s a twelve-and-a-half mile “Race To The Clouds” with a finishing line over 14,000 feet. There are sections of the run that are crazy, Glen Cove and The Ws, and then there are the sections of the run that are borderline suicidal: The Devil’s Playground, Bottomless Pit, etc. You get those turns wrong, and by the time your wreckage stops bouncing your clothes will be out of style.
You need confidence and skill and a great amount of bravery to take this place on. And those who have, and succeeded, have all three of those in large quantities; racers like Unser (literally the entire family) and Walter Rohrl and Ari Vatanen and Michelle Mouton and Sébastien Loeb. Loeb, arguable the greatest rally driver of all time, holds the outright course record at Pikes Peak. Volkswagen has the idea that they should hold, if not the outright record, then at least the EV record.
Power & Performance
Uninterestingly named the “I.D. R Pikes Peak,” it is a particularly nasty looking little beast. The IDRPP looks like a 7/8th scale model of a Le Mans car, only with the driver sitting smack in the middle (it looks) and a no-holds-barred approach to aerodynamics. There’s tons of subtle aero work here and there, and then you get to that rear wing and realize “subtle” has nothing to do with this car.
The I.D. R Pikes Peak weighs less than 2,500 lbs., cranks out 680 horsepower and 479 lb-ft. of torque, and hits 60 in 2.25 seconds. VW says it is “faster than even Formula 1 and Formula E cars,” to which I say, yes, but that’s in a straight line to 60. Racing is more than that. With those numbers backing up the Wolfsburg company, they hope to beat the existing electric car record (8:57.118) in the annual Race to the Clouds, if not the outright record.
VW points out that the IDRPP has not one, but two electric motors, generating the system’s capacity of 680 horsepower. For EVs, that’s not uncommon, given that electric motors, even powerful ones, are about the size of a picnic basket. Bizarrely, this is not the first time VW has run at Pikes Peak with a twin-engine car. It’s not even the second. In 1985, 1986, and 1987, Volkswagen engineers opted for two power units in a twin-engine Golf that VW described as “sensational.” You say “sensational,” I say “mental.” Tomayto, Tomahto.

Battery Technology
Power storage is accomplished via lithium-ion batteries that are similar to production EVs. Volkswagen says power density is the crucial factor for the system when producing high voltage, and Li-Ion batts are just the ticket. They further point out that around 20 percent of the electric energy needed will be generated during the drive, the key to that being energy recovery. The IDRPP uses the same energy recovery scheme found in everyday Teslas and Priuses, turning the electric motors into generators when you hit the binders, converting some of the braking energy back into electricity, and then storing this in the battery.
Lone Wolf
Romain Dumas was chosen for the driving duties. Dumas, a 39-year-old Frenchman, seems like an odd choice at first. Normally, people who run at Pikes Peak are rally types (i.e. completely nerveless Scandinavians with ice water for blood and zero self-preservation instinct), but Romain Dumas is a former 24 Hours of Le Mans champion and defending Pikes Peak champion. So he does seem like a good choice.
“It was absolutely fantastic to see the completed I.D. R for the first time, and to take it out for its first spin,” Dumas said. “What Volkswagen has managed to put together from scratch over the past few months has my greatest respect.”
Precise Calculations
And if running a race that features no guard rails and drops measured in the thousands of feet isn’t difficult enough, bear in mind that testing on the hill climb is very incomplete. You can only run on certain sections and the bulk of the testing is not done on Pikes Peak at all, but at racetracks. So, it’s educated guesswork, but guesswork nonetheless. I hope everybody has their sums right.
A 4,720 vertical-foot climb, 156 corners, only a single run is allowed, sunshine at the start but up at the 14,115-foot summit of Pikes Peak it can be below freezing.
The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb gets underway on June 24th in Colorado Springs, Colorado. What’s not to love?
“We now have a packed schedule of testing ahead of us and I am looking forward to every meter,” Dumas said.

2018/04/26,"Volvo Expands Electrification Commitment, Focuses On China","Volvo Cars wants fully electric vehicles to consist of half their lineup by 2025. The announcement builds on Volvo’s commitment last year that all new models released from 2019 will be available as either a mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle.
“Last year we made a commitment to electrification in preparation for an era beyond the internal combustion engine,” explained Håkan Samuelsson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Volvo Cars.
Emerging Markets
The move is also part of Volvo’s strategy to strengthen itself in China, a prime market for electrified vehicles. The Chinese government plans to have new-energy vehicles account for more than 20 percent of annual sales by 2025, which equates to more than seven million autos, based on Chinese government forecasts.
“China’s electric future is Volvo Cars’ electric future,” Samuelsson added. “Today we reinforce and expand that commitment in the world’s leading market for electrified cars.”
Volvo currently assembles the S90 and S90L T8 Twin Engine in China, and production of the XC60 T8 Twin Engine will commence in China soon, meaning all three Volvo China plants – Luqiao, Chengdu, and Daqing – will produce either plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicles.
Forthcoming Models
China is Volvo Cars’ largest individual market, recording a 23.3 percent first quarter sales increase this year alone, while sales in China last year passed 100,000 units for the first time. The eagerly anticipated XC40, crowned 2018 European Car of the Year, is expected to find a warm audience in China as well.
“The early success of the XC40 supports Volvo Cars’ expectations of strong demand for its new small SUV in China,” reads a statement from Volvo Cars. “These expectations are also underpinned by growth forecasts for the segment over the next five years, as well as a growing middle-class population and China GDP growth trends driven by domestic consumption.”
Volvo will have an extensive array of hybrid vehicles on display at the Beijing Auto Show, which runs through May 4th.

2018/04/26,"McLaren North America Delivers 5,000th Vehicle","McLaren North America recently celebrated the delivery of its 5,000th car in the North American market. The milestone machine, a Silica White 570S Spider, was purchased by California physician Dr. Gary Leach.
“The McLaren 570S Spider really appealed to me as an amazing combination of a car that can be comfortable and enjoyable for a daily driver, but that has the performance, gearshift, and brakes that will allow me to fully enjoy it on a track day,” he said.
Humble Beginnings
McLaren Automotive retailed its first vehicle in North America in December 2011, which now represents more than a third of the company’s global sales. McLaren’s growth doubled in 2016 following the introduction of the 570 Sports Series line, with 2017 seeing the addition of the 570S Spider and the Super Series 720S.
“From small beginnings back in 2011, we have firmly established the McLaren range of sportscars and supercars as class leaders that appeal to a wide range of discerning enthusiasts,” said Tony Joseph, President, McLaren North America. “We are experiencing unprecedented growth in the North American market from just a handful of cars in 2011 to more than 1,200 retail sales here last year.”
Continued Expansion
McLaren is expanding their network of retailers in North America as new models like the track-focused McLaren Senna arrive later this year. As part of the company’s Track 22 business plan, McLaren will launch another 12 cars by 2022, with half its offerings being hybrids by then. 22 is also the current number of McLaren retailers in North America.
“We are taking steps to ensure that our presence and customer service is at the cutting edge of the luxury performance car market,” Joseph said.

2018/04/26,Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury: Jurassic Ark,"What is this thing? Mercedes says it’s a crossover based on an exclusive high-end sedan and an SUV. I can kind of take their word for it. I can also say this is a lumpen blunder of the highest order. And given that this thing is enormous – 207 inches, about three-fifths as long as a London bus – this is a huge mistake!
Just to get you up to speed, Maybach, which used to be its own company back in the 1930s, was revived a while back as its own “brand” again by its owner, Mercedes, and then absorbed into Mercedes as sort of an uber-S-Class.
Hold The Subtlety Please
Maybachs are the ultra-glitzy cars just north of the best “normal” Mercedes you can get. The only person I ever heard of buying one of the reconstituted Maybachs was Samuel L. Jackson, which kind of makes sense. I doubt that Mr. Jackson will be buying one of these, however, since he strikes me as a man of taste and bearing, both of which the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury lacks.
Oh, and while I’m here: Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury. I’ve heard more imaginative names for Soviet fishing trawlers.
I guess the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury (snicker) aims to be the nee plus ultra of luxo-crossover-SUVs. It’s as if Merc took one look at the Bentley Bentayga and said, “Halte mein Bier!” This thing is stuffed to the rafters with tech and luxury and it’s the size of a Manhattan apartment. This thing is all about presence. This car exists for the sole reason of letting all the little people know how little they are. This is the car Daisy Buchanan would bounce off Myrtle Wilson’s skull.
Interior Treatments
At least Mercedes-Maybach dials it back on the interior. Apart from there being lots of everything and even the most meaningless of materials rendered in the highest of quality, the inside is done up in a fairly conventional manner. Merc says the colors employed are “typical of the brand” which means rose gold, crystal white, and pearl grey all over the place. And since the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury (larf) is designed for chauffeur-driven use, things are sharply focused on the rear passengers and their “well-being.”
However, the front seats do have such niceties like the free-standing, Widescreen Cockpit with two 12.3-inch displays. The seats are framed in rose gold and sheathed in crystal white Nappa leather, and the instrument panel is done up in a shade of brown that features a light metallic finish. Lustrous surfaces in polished aluminum are there to “generate exciting reflections.” Like I said, relatively normal but tacky as a 4th rate casino.

Battery & Powertrain
The powertrain is, at least, interesting. Conceived from the ground up as an electric car, the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury (chortle) comes with four compact permanent-magnet synchronous motors, offering fully variable all-wheel drive. The total system output is 750 horsepower. That’s probably just enough, because even though Merc-Bach doesn’t give a figure for this massive beast, you know the all up weight is comparable to a Kriegsmarine mine sweeper.
The battery can be charged by cable at public charging stations, conventional domestic socket outlets or, even more conveniently, via induction: the charging current is transmitted by an electromagnetic field below the car. A fast-charging function, based on the CCS standard, allows a charging capacity of up to 350 kW and can get you enough power to achieve a range of around 60 miles in just five minutes. The battery pack is underneath the floor and has an usable capacity of around 80 kWh, good enough for a range of over 200 miles. The top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph, so that’s fun.
Catch 22
The caveats about the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury (chuckle) are two. First, it’s a show car. So maybe if we, those of us who have eyes, rage loud enough, Merc-Bach will hear our pleas and never, ever produce this thing.
Second, the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury (sneer) is made for and will be shown at the Auto China 2018 show in Beijing, which runs through May 4th. Maybe there’s some subtleties about appealing to the nouveau Chinese oligarch set that I’m missing. Maybe this thing will hit the stands and a bunch of well-healed, routinely corrupt autocrats will say “that’s mine!”
Hey, maybe they built that wall 1,300 years ago to keep this thing in.

The vehicle will arrive in more new markets this fiscal year, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Uruguay.
Nissan moved 54,451 Leaf models in fiscal year 2017, a 15 percent increase from 47,423 a year earlier. Nissan has sold more than 320,000 since it was first introduced in 2010. With availability in 51 markets, Nissan says the Leaf is the best-selling electric car in the world. The 2018 model was released late last year.
“We expect its continuous leadership in 2018,” Schillaci added.
Safety & Accolades
The 2018 Nissan Leaf comes with ProPILOT autonomous driving technology (ProPILOT Assist in the U.S.), ProPILOT Park and e-Pedal, as well as increased power and range. The new Leaf also received a 5-star safety rating from the Japan New Car Assessment Program in February. The model’s ProPILOT technology helped it score 94.8 points out of a possible 100 for occupant safety in a collision.
The new Nissan Leaf was also named “2018 World Green Car” by the World Car Awards in March.

It looks like fairly recently, someone, somewhere within the confines of the Cadillac office in New York City (did you know they were based there?) realized that simply telling people you’re the “standard of the world” is just the start. You can’t just say it, you have to do it. And, thankfully, Caddy seems to be doing it these days.
It’s hard to argue with rides like V-Series CTSs and stuff like that, and with everyone obligated to make a whole range of SUVs, Caddy has finally grabbed the last niche in that world too. The XT4 was ushered into existence by a team of young designers, a smooth move since “the young” are the heart of the XT4’s target demographic. The XT4 (although a bland and hopeless name) is part of Cadillac’s new “Y” trim strategy of Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Sport models, said to offer distinctive styling and trim finishes.
Interior Highlights
It breaks down like this: The XT4 Luxury has Light Platinum/Jet Black with Aluminum Metallized decor trim; the XT4 Premium Luxury gets Jet Black with Diamond-Cut Aluminum, Light Platinum/Jet Black with Linear Galaxy High-Gloss Wood, or Sedona/Jet Black with Fineline Calico High-Gloss Wood. The XT4 Sport gets lots of black and chrome bits: Jet Black with Cinnamon Accents with Twenty-Two High-Gloss Carbon Fiber, Light Wheat/Jet Black with Red Accents and Morello Red High-Gloss Carbon Fiber, or Sedona/Jet Black with Fineline Calico High-Gloss Wood.
The XT4’s cabin is all sweeping arcs and tapered lines to give it a taut, tightly-wrapped appearance. Even though it’s compact, the XT4 offers lots of space, especially for rear passengers, along with 48.9 cubic feet of cargo volume with the rear seats folded. Other interior elements of note are the three-spoke, leather-wrapped steering wheel, the heavily-bolstered, sport-inspired seats (with a massage feature), available white ambient lighting, and Cadillac’s first rotary controller for various vehicle features.
Tech Treatments
Naturally, since this is a Cadillac for 2019, there is a boatload of tech. The XT4 comes with the brand’s most advanced infotainment interface with smartphone-like controls and improved voice recognition, and there’s an available 4G LTE connection to boot. There’s an eight-inch diagonal screen, near-Field Communication for pairing a smartphone, a 15-watt wireless charging system, four standard USB ports, and three 12-volt accessory power outlets. There is even an SD memory card reader in the center console and a full suite of active safety features.

Power & Performance
The Cadillac XT4 gets an all-new, 2.0-liter turbo engine that puts out 118.5 horsepower per liter of output. Which is, to use the technical term, a lot. No word on how much boost that turbo is cranking out, but to get those numbers Caddy must be squeezing those cylinders till they squeal. The plant also has high and low valve lift and Active Fuel Management, which is essentially a cylinder deactivation system. When you add in the direct injection, active thermal management, and the twin-scroll turbocharger, the mill puts out an SAE-certified 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque.
Power is put to the pavement (you’re going to seriously off-road this thing, are you?) through a nine-speed automatic that helps the XT4 get 30 mpg on the highway.
Chassis & Suspension
The chassis work is done by a strut-type front suspension and a five-link independent setup out back. The standard Driver Select Mode allows you to tune that as you see fit for different driving styles and road conditions. The twin-clutch all-wheel drive system offers a decoupling function to eliminate drivetrain friction and enhance efficiency. The Continuous Damping Control, found on the XT4 Sport’s available Active Sport Suspension, uses electronic sensors to monitor the road and adjust damping every two milliseconds.
Stopping is done via “electro-hydraulic braking assist,” a first for Cadillac. The new brake system replaces the traditional vacuum-assisted design to improve fuel economy and provide better packaging, according to Cadillac.
Pricing & Availability
The XT4 starts at $35,790, which is not bad at all, and goes on sale this fall. When it hits the lot, the 2019 XT4 will come in eight exterior colors.

2018/04/20,Polestar 1 Heading To China After Intense Testing,"Test drivers and engineers recently spent two weeks in the freezing temperatures north of the Artctic Circle. The job? Put a Polestar 1 prototype through strict endurance testing in temperatures as low as -18 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the frigid temperatures and harsh conditions, the Prototype exceeded expectations.
“Our test drivers have given us some enthusiastic feedback on the handling and dynamics especially,” said Thomas Ingenlath, Chief Executive Officer, Polestar.
Testing & Analysis
The team analyzed how the car’s various components responded while in cold weather, from the chassis and suspension, to the drivetrain and batteries. Test drivers focused specifically on the Polestar 1’s torque vectoring system, enabled by two rear electric motors with individual planetary gear sets.
“Besides being very happy with the balance of the chassis, they are particularly excited about the torque vectoring,” Ingenlath continued. “We are now very confident about how this enhances the Polestar 1’s cornering responsiveness and accuracy.”
The location was also selected for the ability to test on ice, which gave the team a perspective on the handling dynamics.
“This is a driver’s car,” Ingenlath added.
In Person
The Polestar 1 is now heading to Beijing for Auto China 2018 although prototype testing will continue throughout this year. After making its global media debut in Shanghai last October, this is the first opportunity for the Chinese public to see the new performance hybrid. Auto China 2018 begins on April 25th and runs through May 4th. According to Ingenlath, Polestar’s presence at the show is crucial.
“We look forward to introducing the car to the Chinese public for the first time, a key market for Polestar,” he said.

2018/04/19,"Infiniti Promises New Models, Manufacturing, Electrification In China","Infiniti has announced plans to build five new vehicles in China in the next five years, beginning with the QX50 crossover. The news comes ahead of the Beijing International Motor Show and highlights the importance of the Chinese market and electrification for Infiniti.
“Over the next five years Infiniti is planning to localize five new vehicles in China, tripling our sales in our fastest growth market, globally,” explained Roland Krueger, Chairman and Global President, Infiniti Motor Company, Ltd. “As part of our roadmap to electrify our portfolio, we anticipate that by 2025, more than 50 percent of new Infiniti vehicles sold globally and in China will be electrified.”
Continued Growth
Infiniti operates in China via a partnership with Dongfeng Motor Company Ltd., China’s largest automotive joint venture. In 2017, Infiniti sold a record 48,408 vehicles in China, a 16 percent increase from the prior year.
“Together with our partner Dongfeng Motor Company Ltd., Infiniti is pursuing localization in China for China, expanding our network footprint and introducing new technologies, Krueger continued.
Before the Los Angeles Auto Show last year, Infiniti revealed the world’s first production variable compression engine for the 2019 QX50. The 2.0-liter engine, known as a “VC-Turbo,” adjusts its compression ratio to maximize performance. Infiniti says this challenges the notion that only hybrid and diesel powertrains can deliver high torque and efficiency.
“We will continue to strive to make Infiniti the top premium challenger brand in the market,” Krueger added. 
Availability & In Person
During the Beijing International Motor Show the new QX50 will be unveiled for the first time in Asia. Local production of the QX50 will begin in the near future at the company’s manufacturing facility in Dalian, China. The QX50 crossovers built in China will be sold exclusively to the Chinese market and will be available for purchase later this year.

2018/04/19,2018 Ford F-150: EPA Figures Announced For Power Stroke Diesel Engine,"Earlier this year, Ford revealed the performance specs for the F-150’s first 3.0-liter Power Stroke diesel engine. At the time, fuel economy ratings from the EPA were forthcoming but Ford says those have officially arrived. EPA-estimates come in at 22/30 city/highway and 25 combined mpg.
“Even a few years ago, customers wouldn’t have imagined an EPA-estimated rating of 30 mpg highway would be possible in a full-size pickup,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford Executive Vice President, Product Development and Purchasing.
The fuel economy ratings are achieved in part by the F-150’s aluminum-alloy body, a 10-speed automatic transmission, and the use of durable materials like compacted graphite iron throughout the engine. The 3.0-liter Power Stroke shares similar commercial-grade technologies with the larger 6.7 found in Ford’s Super Duty trucks.
“Our team of crazy-smart engineers rose to the challenge,” Thai-Tang said.
The 3.0-liter Power Stroke diesel generates 250 horsepower and 440 lb-ft. of torque to provide a best-in-class towing capability of 11,440 lbs., according to Ford. In addition to the tow rating, Ford says the new Power Stroke provides a best-in-class diesel payload of 2,020 lbs. for XL and XLT fleet applications, and 1,940 lbs. for retail applications.
The 2018 Ford F-150 with new 3.0-liter Power Stroke diesel will begin shipping to dealers in May.

2018/04/19,Chevrolet Cars Set For “Restyled” Faces,"Coherency. Coherency is a good thing, especially when it comes to corporate brands and styling. Ideally, you want everything you make to have it. Take Chevrolet, for example. You wouldn’t want a Chevy Malibu to look way different from a Chevy Impala. So, when a car company, Chevrolet in this case, makes a styling update, that update has to propagate across the entire company line.
Special Characteristics
Mainly what we’re talking about here is styling cues; belt lines, overall greenhouse shapes, grill designs, badging and where the badges go, that sort of thing. Chevy says what they are going for in the immediate future is muscular designs, new features, and more choices.
“The restyled face of Chevy cars for 2019 is characterized by a family-like appearance, with each model honoring its Chevrolet heritage while showing off expressive designs,” said John Cafaro, Executive Director, Global Chevrolet Design.
And I can totally see where he’s coming from. ‘Family-like appearance‘ is the key here.
“We are committed to offering consumers a full lineup of products with fresh designs, new technologies, and efficient powertrain options,” added Brian Sweeney, U.S. Vice President of Chevrolet. “The investments we have made in Spark, Cruze, and Malibu will help position the brand for success in competitive segments that still make up a significant part of the total industry.”
Design Language
As Sweeny alluded to, Chevy’s first go ’round will start with the 2019 Malibu, Cruze, and Spark. To that end the cars will each offer a broad diversity of trims and packages from entry-level to high-end. And Chevy will also have to serve fleets since they represent a quarter of the industry’s retail market.
Chevy’s first task in shepherding the DNA of their fleet is restyling the faces of the cars with signature lighting that will make each instantly recognizable as a Chevy. The redesigned front ends for the Spark, Cruze, and Malibu will offer a more premium look while maintaining their athletic body sides. And yeah, this is the first time I’ve heard the phrase “athletic body” used in conjunction with the Spark and Cruze. Anyway, Chevy will give greater attention to detail like the intricate sculpting on the grilles and the brand’s signature dual-element taillamps.
Malibu RS
The Malibu RS, a first for this ‘Bu generation, will offer a sporty, personalized appearance propelled by blacked-out styling cues like the sport grille, bowtie emblems, rear spoiler, 18-inch machined wheels, and dual exhaust. The inside introduces a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, black cloth seats, and a standard eight-inch touchscreen for the Infotainment 3 system. There will also be a new CVT transmission standard on models that come with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine.

  Cruze
The Chevy Cruze, along with the updated front fascia, welcomes new interior colors and a new infotainment system with a seven-inch color touchscreen. Remote start and automatic climate control are now standard on LT and Premier, but optional on other trims. The LS Hatch trim is added to the Cruze Hatch line for the first time. That sounds like a good move, since 20 percent of all Cruze sales in its first full year of production are the Hatchback.
Spark
The Spark, which sells by the train-load in its segment, gets new front-end styling with the same cues found on the updated Malibu and Cruze. New exterior color options will also be coming along with revised interior trim and an additional available safety feature called Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking. Chevy does not go into detail about what Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking is, but I bet it has something to do with hitting the brakes for you when you’re moving in a forward direction at lower speeds and aren’t paying attention.
Don’t hold me to that, though.
Availability & In Person
You will be able to see the new design direction for the corporate automotive giant when the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu, Cruze, and Spark go on sale later this year.

2018/04/18,Will Kia’s Wireless EV Charging System Change The World?,"Kia has come up with a rather nifty wireless charging system for EVs and, honestly, this sounds pretty cool. As anyone who has ever messed with tangled power cords and such knows, wires can be a real pain. And I’m also willing to bet a chunk of people who are hesitant to buy EVs don’t like the idea of having to mess with chords and wires, and always having to plug them in all the time.
Bright Ideas
About a hundred years ago there was this half-crazy Serbian guy named Nikola Tesla. About half of his ideas made logical sense (alternating current, florescent lighting etc.) and the other half were borderline ya-ya (electric death rays, The Tesla Ozone Company etc.) but my favorite idea of his, borderline ya-ya or not, was power transmission without wires. No, I’m not sure how it was supposed to work, or even if it would work, but the idea itself was fantastic. No more wires, no more plugging things in, everything just runs.
What Kia and their tech partner in this, Mojo, have come up with isn’t a full on Tesla deal, but it’s still pretty cool. Kia rigged up a small fleet of its popular Soul to develop the wireless charging system. And the really neat thing about what they came up with is that not only is it wireless, it’s not nearly as finicky as you’d expect. Even when the Kia Soul is misaligned over the charger, the system can wirelessly charge cars with up to 85 percent efficiency.
The wireless charging system, which has been in development for three years already, is said to be an important step in the future of electric vehicles, according to Hyundai and Kia. And it’s easy to agree with them. If you can take another hassle out of owning an electric vehicle, the better our EV future will be. The project, a collaboration between Hyundai and Kia, Mojo Mobility Inc., and the U.S. Department of Energy, shows a way for future electric vehicles in which plugs are no longer necessary.
Park & Charge
The system works by using an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two coils. There’s a transmitter on the ground and a receiver on the bottom of the vehicle. You simply park your car above the transmitter to begin charging and the electrical energy is sent through an inductive coupling, which uses that energy to charge the battery. It’s the same way a Sonicare toothbrush charges, only on a much bigger scale. And again, even if there is some misalignment between the transmitter in the ground and the receiver in the car, charging can still happen.
RELATED
Audi's Super Bowl 2020 Ad Featuring the e-tron Sportback
It’s easy to see how this system could play out: every shopping mall and downtown parking lot will have an inductive charging pad buried in it. All you have to do is park your car as you normally would, and while you’re away, it’s automatically charging, no muss, no fuss.
Future Considerations
Sadly, there are no current plans to offer the wireless charging system on production vehicles for sale to consumers. That makes sense, because while installing the wireless charging gear in the car would be pretty straight forward, it’s the parking space part of the equation where things get sticky. Sure, simply modifying parking spots is relatively easy, but it’s the number of parking spots that’s the potential problem.
There is also a downside on getting the charging pad installed for home use. The home high voltage charger for a Tesla, say, is easy to bolt into your wall and any competent electrician can hook it into your 220V line in a snap. The Kia system potentially means cutting into your garage floor to install the pad and run the wiring. That could be a hassle.
On the upside, if this system works out and becomes widely adopted, driving and charging – and therefore living with – your electric vehicle could become a lot easier.

2018/04/17,Buick Enspire Concept Debuts In China,"The Buick Enspire all-electric concept SUV has made its global debut in China, billed as an exploration of the brand’s design ideas and innovative technologies for future mobility. With the Enspire name, Buick retains the general practice of using the letter “e” for their SUV nomenclature; Enclave, Envision, and Encore.
Power & Performance
Buick was slim on the details but the Enspire has advanced propulsion technology, allowing the concept to travel 370 miles on a single charge. The propulsion system, dubbed “eMotion” by Buick, generates a maximum power output of 410 kW and can launch the vehicle to 60 in four seconds. Buick says the Enspire supports both fast and wireless charging, and the battery can be charged to 80 percent within 40 minutes.
Styling & Technology
The “surround skyline” interior theme is really of note. Buick says this is a suspended theater-type seating arrangement, meant to open up the cabin for occupants. There is an OLED screen, an augmented reality heads-up display system, and 5G connectivity.
Judging by the press photos, the interior is smooth and streamlined with most of the vehicle’s functions being controlled either by voice, gesture, or touch. Although Buick did not specify, the interior looks befitting of an autonomous vehicle.
Typical to most concepts, the body is aerodynamic and nicely sculpted.
Availability & In Person
Unfortunately, Buick did not reveal their long-range plans for the Enspire. Given Buick’s presence and following in China, it’s likely to see a release there first if anywhere. No word on if it will arrive in the United States or other nations. In the meantime, the Enspire Concept will be on display at Auto China 2018 in Beijing from April 25th until May 4th.

2018/04/14,New Dodge Durango Package Keeps Departed Era Alive,"The Dodge Durango is one of the most underrated SUVs of our time. I’ve said this before, but “grown ups” who still love performance or muscle cars will find the Durango satisfying to their appetites. The modern day Durango has plenty of room, comfort, and technology for the family, but lots of grunt under the hood. It’s so nicely balanced on the spectrum: there’s luxury and technology, but also aggressive styling and raw power. Lots of raw power. Lots.
House of Power
For example, the 2018 Durango SRT features a 392 (cubic inches) HEMI V8 with 475 horsepower and 470 lb-ft. of torque. It hits 60 mph in 4.4 seconds and runs the quarter-mile in 12.9 seconds as certified by the National Hot Rod Association. Trips to the swimming pool, piano recital, and grocery store are now infinitely more exciting. The Dodge Durango laughs at the notion that family vehicles are boring vehicles. And Dodge is continuing to chuckle with the new Rallye Appearance Package for the 2018 Durango GT.
If this were any other SUV, a new appearance package might fly under the radar. New appearance packages sprout up like dandelions on a spring day, and understandably so since they do dress up a given vehicle nicely. Yet, for Dodge, announcements like this go just a bit farther, because they are the only automaker still carrying the muscle car torch. This was evidenced recently by the new Shakedown Package for the mighty Challenger, which gives the iconic car a Dominic Toretto, Brian O’Conner vibe.
Light Em’ Up
Again, new packages like this are common, but for Dodge there is distinct purpose when they release one. It goes beyond trying to attract more people to the dealership, or to get the automotive press to talk about it, or to jazz up the front end so it looks pretty at the auto show. Yeah, it may well do all those things, but for Dodge it’s about adding one more layer as they stay true to the unembellished and fervent mantras that are the muscle car culture. The GT resides at the midpoint in the Durango lineup, but it’s no exception. It gets lit by that aforementioned torch just as the Challenger would.
“Many of our customers love the performance look of the Durango R/T and Durango SRT, but are happy with the award-winning Pentastar V6 engine’s 295 horsepower and the excellent fuel efficiency it delivers,” explained Steve Beahm, Head of Passenger Cars, Dodge/SRT, Chrysler and FIAT, FCA – North America. “This new Durango GT Rallye Appearance Package gives those three-row SUV buyers the best of both worlds.”

The front fascia and LED fog lamps have a look that mimics the R/T and SRT models, and it’s available with the popular Brass Monkey Wheels. That’s it. Simple. Simple but effective.
Performance & Technology
The Durango GT runs a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 that generates 295 horsepower and 260 lb-ft. of torque, mated to a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic. When properly equipped, it can tow 6,200 lbs., a best-in-class figure according to Dodge. The Durango’s list of available features is nearly endless from Blu-ray and DVD players, to premium audio systems and navigation. Inside, driver’s have 85 cubic feet of cargo space and 50 different seating configurations at their disposal.
Pricing & Availability
The new Rallye Appearance Package for the Dodge Durango GT is $1,495 and is available now. If you add it to your Durango, do share a picture with us on Twitter.

2018/04/14,Toyota & Alabama A&M University Partner On Mobility Initiative,"Toyota Motor North America and Alabama A&M University (AAMU) are launching a “student-led mobility initiative,” which aims to strengthen the area’s connection and access to education, jobs, and clean vehicles. The initiative will unite an interdisciplinary team of students and faculty for the “Clean Low Emissions Approach & Novel Transportation Innovation Practice,” otherwise known as “CLEAN-TRIP.”
The effort is the first of similar initiatives Toyota is establishing across the United States.
“Creating a clean, safe and more efficient environment for the campus proper, as well as the immediate and larger community, has been a major thrust of AAMU for decades,” explained Dr. Ernst Cebert, facilitator of the project and professor within the College of Agricultural, Life and Natural Sciences. “Through this project, we will engage students with hands-on learning to address real world problems.”
“We partnered with AAMU because of their focus on renewable energy, strong STEAM programs, and history of preparing well-qualified graduates,” added Al Smith, Group Vice President, Toyota Social Innovation.
Toyota is providing an initial grant of $300,000, which includes scholarships for students accepted into the program.  In addition to monetary support, students will work with Toyota to learn the company’s approach to problem solving and critical thinking. Once in the program, students will interact with local residents to better understand their mobility challenges.
“By developing a mobility solution through collaboration with the community, we can help guide students to create better ways to move that also improve quality of life,” Smith said.
In 2017, AAMU received funding from the Federal Transportation Agency to purchase zero-emission electric buses. AAMU was founded in 1875 by a former slave, William Hooper Councill and opened as the Huntsville Normal School. Today, the university has nearly 5,000 undergraduates and over 800 graduate students, with 75 percent of those students already involved in community service projects.

2018/04/12,"Land Rover “Draws” Massive Defender Outline At 9,000 Feet In The French Alps","So Land Rover has been in the truck-making game for 70 years now. That’s an impressive string, especially when you consider what the British automotive industry went through in the late-70s, early-80s. But here we are, and as you would expect, Land Rover decided to celebrate.
And how did they celebrate this milestone? By making a giant Defender in the snow of the French Alps, of course. No, it doesn’t make much sense to me either, but it’s still kind of cool. The giant Land Rover snow art was made in anticipation of World Land Rover Day, April 30th, which will be exactly 70 years since the original Landy was first shown at the 1948 Amsterdam Motor Show.
Vertical Limits
In La Plagne, France, which is southwest from Chamonix, snow artist Simon Beck, who somehow has a job creating geometric art on foot, confronted sub-zero temperatures to produce the outline of a Defender 820 feet across, 9,000 feet up in the French Alps. Yeah, the idea is kind of nutty, and the details make it even more so. To create the high-altitude Defender, Beck walked for 20,894 steps through the French Alps. That adds up to a total of 10.2 miles.
“Making my snow art requires endurance, accuracy, and strength – all attributes shared with the Defender. Its iconic shape is so simple and recognized across the world; this must be the most recognizable piece of art I’ve ever made,” related Simon (although that sounds like he was reading something a marketing weasel handed him).
And I get what they were going for here, but if it was me in place of Simon Beck, I would have made them trace it out on a sandy beach in Hawaii or some place warm like that.
Humble Beginnings
Of course, the thing about doing this in the first place is that it ties back to how Land Rover got its start. You’ve heard the phrase, “I sketched it out on the back of a napkin?” That’s pretty close to how Land Rover got going. It all started when Rover’s Engineering Director, Maurice Wilks, first sketched the shape for the original Land Rover in the sand of Red Wharf Bay, England. See guys: Sand. Hawaii would have been much better.
Anyway, Maurice proposed the idea to his brother, Spencer, who just happened to be Landy’s Managing Director. Spencer liked it, christened it the “Land Rover,” which over time turned into the modern day Defender.
Waxing Poetics
If you’re a fan of the go-anywhere Brit, there’s no need to hike up into the Alps to join the celebrations. Land Rover is inviting fans to join the World Land Rover Day fun via an online broadcast from the UK at 3:00 pm EDT on April 30th. Programming will feature the significant people who created “the world’s most-loved 4x4s.” That, of course, made me cough the word “JEEP!” very loudly, but okay, people still like Land Rover. Let’s not gild the lily too much, shall we chaps?

Anyway, that online broadcast will also take an in-depth look at the band’s most innovative technologies, from the original Series Land Rover and Defender origins, up to the introduction of the Range Rover in 1970 and the Discovery in 1989.
Continued Celebrations
The U.S. market will get in on the fun by celebrating World Land Rover Day at its new 12-acre headquarters in Mahwah, New Jersey. There will be a gathering of people and products of historical significance for the Land Rover brand. Members of the winning 1993 American Camel Trophy U.S. team will be reunited with the vehicles that competed in that year’s rally in Malaysia.
In addition, a North American Spec Range Rover Classic from the first year Range Rover was sold in America will be on hand, along with several examples of the North American version of the Defender sold here from 1992 to 1997.

2018/04/11,New Chevy Silverado HD To Arrive Next Year,"Chevrolet announced the new Silverado HD will debut next year as a 2020 model. The forthcoming HD will be the third entirely new Silverado in just 18 months, joining the 2019 Silverado 1500 and Silverado medium-duty series trucks. The automaker believes the new Silverado portfolio will drive growth and sales.
“With a completely new, expanded range of Silverado models on the horizon, we expect to see even more truck buyers in Chevrolet showrooms,” explained Alan Batey, Global Head of Chevrolet. “All three Silverado models offer a wide range of choices, as no two truck customers are alike.”
According to Chevrolet, the new Silverado HD is undergoing rigorous performance testing, with the validation metrics for durability having increased. Silverado HD prototypes will be road-tested later this year in an effort to meet the market’s demands and expectations.
“Chevrolet has built more than 85 million trucks in 100 years and we have applied that accumulated truck expertise to the new Silverado range,” Batey said. “Every Silverado is built to be long-lasting and dependable, as many customers need their trucks to earn a living or to do what they enjoy most when they’re off the clock.”
The first production models are scheduled to roll off the assembly lines in Flint, Michigan during the third quarter of 2019. Chevrolet says complete product and pricing information will be available closer to that time.

2018/04/10,Global Ford Focus Introduced; Inspires New Product Development Trends,"Take a new product development process, mix in human-centered design and customer feedback, and toss in a dash of new technology and simmer until tender. What do you have? The new Ford Focus.
“We’re evolving our successful One Ford strategy to find new ways to create a sporty-looking small car our customers will love,” explained Jim Farley, President of Global Markets, Ford Motor Company. “We’ll tailor which cars in the Focus lineup we offer in markets around the world to ensure we best meet customers’ different needs and preferences.”
Tailor Made
Ford employees spent hundreds of hours speaking with customers from around the world, and the new Focus will be “tailored” to each global region accordingly. Ford says, through the use of globally common but flexible architectures and modules, the new Focus can better appeal to individual needs while maintaining a high level of commonality but low complexity.
Future Ford vehicles will adopt this pattern. In essence, the automaker will move from individual platforms to more flexible architectures paired with modular “families.” This will streamline a number of common components like engines, electronics, and sunroofs.
Tech Goodies
Expect the new Focus to tech it up with high-speed internet, wireless device charging, and the new CoPilot360 system, essentially a package of advanced safety features. The content of CoPilot360 will vary by region, but generally includes things like Adaptive Cruise Control, Speed Sign Recognition, Lane-Centering, Evasive Steering Assist, and an updated version of Active Park Assist.
The enhanced version of Active Park Assist operates the gear selection, acceleration, and braking when parking – prior versions required the driver to shift the gear and control the brake pedal. CoPilot360 also includes an Adaptive Front Lighting System, a camera-based technology that pre-adjusts the headlamps for improved visibility, like around a curve for example.
SYNC 3, housed in the eight-inch color touchscreen, is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. With SYNC 3, drivers can voice control a number of functions like audio and navigation, or climate and connected devices. The FordPass app has a vehicle locator service, just in case you lose your new Focus in the mall parking lot on a Saturday afternoon. That same app doubles as a remote start.
Big Things & Small Packages
Get ready to stretch out backseat passengers! The new Focus gains nearly 2.4 inches of shoulder room, two inches of knee clearance, and nearly three inches of legroom. Up front, Ford says the instrument panel is “optimized for getting in and out of the car.” Wonder how they pulled that off?! The electronic parking brake and rotary shifter make for easier access to the cupholders. Perfect. Coffee time!

There are even soft knee pads on the center console for added comfort.
And how about this: special consideration was given to the shape of the mirrors to help reduce that air throbbing effect when one window is lowered while driving. Pretty cool!
Those with furry family members will find ample room in the wagon models for pet carriers. With the rear seats folded flat, the new Focus wagon offers a generous 58 cubic feet of space. Ford says considering the needs of pet owners was important during development.
Power & Performance
The new Focus receives a chassis and suspension overhaul to increase torsional rigidity by 20 percent. Standard drive modes include Normal, Sport, and Eco, and adjust the engine and transmission responses, steering feel, and Adaptive Cruise Control to match a driver’s preferences.
In China, the new Focus offers the 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine or an all-new 1.5-liter EcoBoost engine. In Europe, customers have a 2.0-liter EcoBlue diesel available. North American powertrain options will be announced at a later date. The engines can be paired to an optional eight-speed automatic that actively assesses vehicle and environmental information to adjust clutch pressures for smoother gearshifts.
Pricing & Availability
No word yet on pricing but configurations include, depending on the market, a four-door sedan, five-door estate/wagon, and five-door hatchback. Expect the new Ford Focus in Europe and China yet this year, and in North America in the second half of 2019.
Ford says they will formally introduce the new Focus in North America closer to its on-sale date, which hints at a possible reveal during the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show, or the 2019 North American International Auto Show.

2018/04/10,Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25: The “Collector’s Piece”,"Okay, I am being totally serious here: I think Lotus is messing with us. They have put out so many “special” editions that I am starting to doubt them. Seriously, has anyone ever seen all the special editions in the same place at the same time? At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if someone at Lotus said, “Nah, sorry mate! We was just havin’ a laugh!” and this all turns into some sort of prank.
Anyway, here is the new “special” edition: The Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25 Collector’s Piece.
Name Game
No, that is the real, full name for this thing: Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25 – billed by Lotus as a “collector’s piece.” At first I thought it was a piece, like a piece of a racecar or something. But no, this is an entire car. A specially-prepped, painted and limited-run Lotus Exige Cup 430. And yes, like all Lotus cars, it is impressive. It’s quick, fast, turns like the devil, and does the business.
Lotus will be making only 25 of this version, although the name also applies to it being a tribute to the Lotus 25 Grand Prix car from 1963.
Distinct Markings
To distinguish this edition, every Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25 is finished in metallic Lotus Racing Green, or Old English White, with contrast pinstripes on the front splitter, front access panel, bargeboards (which are new), roof panel, and rear wing, as well as unique decals on each rear buttress. In case you don’t know, Lotus Racing Green is not as dark as British Racing Green, and Old English White was the primary color on the Lotus Cortina (potentially the original sport sedan). This is all the work of the Lotus Exclusive program that combines traditional British craftsmanship with the best of modern design.
Power & Performance
The Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25 employs a supercharger and chargecooler, designed specifically for the unique demands of the engine, which pumps out a very impressive 430 horsepower and 325 lb-ft. of torque. Given the size and weight of an Exige, that is a beautifully grotesque amount of horsepower. 60 mph comes up in merely 3.2 seconds before topping out at 180 mph. Lotus says it’s one of the fastest road cars to lap their Hethel circuit, covering the 2.2 miles in just 1 minute 24.8 seconds.
A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the Exige Cup 430 Type 25. There is also a variable traction control function, linked directly to the ECU and controlled by a six-position rotary switch on the steering column. There are five pre-set traction levels as well as “off”. . . and this is pointing out the obvious to us gearheads, but we all know how much capital-F, Fun that “off” position is going to be!

Aerodynamic Art
Yes, the Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25 is road legal, but it is sort of a British version of a Porsche GT3: This thing shines brightest on the track. Motorsport aero can be found all over the place. The carbon fiber front splitter’s trailing lip helps separate and speed airflow under the car. The new air curtain elements on the front clamshell move air through to the front wheel wells to reduce turbulence and drag. The front louvers reduce the pressure within the front wheel arches and cut lift.
Out back you’ll notice the large cut-out sections behind the rear wheels to reduce wheel arch pressure and boost downforce. Put all that together with the high-set rear wing and rear diffuser, and you’re looking at over 450 lbs. of downforce.
Suspension & Braking
The suspension is as close to perfect as Lotus can make it. That means, as far as you’re concerned, it is perfect. Nitron three-way adjustable shocks and adjustable Eibach front and rear anti-roll bars are standard. Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires are fitted to ultra-lightweight, fully machined, forged aluminum wheels. Stopping is done via forged, four-piston AP Racing brake calipers and race-derived two-piece, J-hook brake discs.
Interior Treatments
On the inside it’s all down to business. The Type 25’s interior includes in-house manufactured carbon race seats, themed in black Alcantara, with bespoke trim and a custom stripe for the head and backrest. The door panels and face-level vents feature new contrast double stitching, and the cabin is finished all around in anodized aluminum and carbon fiber bits and pieces. In a nod to the original Lotus Type 25 Formula 1 car, there is a wooden gear selector knob. Sweet!
Curiously, the Lotus Exige Cup 430 Type 25 is not all Harry Hairshirt track-focused austerity. There is air conditioning, an entertainment system, including iPod and Bluetooth connectivity, and cruise control. There is even carpet and floor mats. However, Lotus says if you want to be all Harry Hairshirt track-focused austerity, you can delete some of those items.
Sigh. I guess this “Special Edition” Lotus will have to go in my Lotto Garage as well.

2018/04/09,2019 Chevy Camaro Lineup Gets Refreshed,"The 2019 Chevy Camaro lineup is getting a slight overhaul with new designs and updated tech and performance features. The automaker says the changes reflect current market trends.
“Lauded since its introduction for its balance of driving fun, refinement and value, the restyled 2019 Camaro reaches even higher with more of the design, technology, and choices that customers want,” explained Steve Majoros, Chevrolet Marketing Director for Cars and Crossovers.
Performance Upgrades
The new Camaro Turbo 1LE joins the V6 1LE, SS 1LE, and ZL1 1LE to complete Camaro’s lineup of 1LE track cars for 2019. The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine found in the Turbo 1LE is paired to a six-speed manual transmission and creates 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft. of torque. A special Drive Mode Selector includes Sport, Track, and Competition modes with performance readouts and launch control.
The chassis, according to Chevrolet, was derived from the V6 1LE to offer solid track performance. Highlights include the FE3 suspension with its larger diameter front and rear stabilizer bars, specifically tuned dampers, stiffer rear cradle bushings, and cross-axis ball joints in the rear tow links to enhance lateral stiffness. Chevrolet also notes the car’s near 50/50 weight balance.
The Turbo 1LE Camaro also includes Brembo bakes with low-metallic performance pads and a flat-bottom steering wheel. Recaro seats are available.
For 2019, the Camaro SS will be offered with launch control and line lock.
Design Updates
The design tweaks on the 2019 Camaro are as much for performance as they are for looks. The different elements – from the grille and hood, to the fascia vents – were designed to enhance air flow and cooling while minimizing drag. The front ends of each Camaro trim have distinct and specific characteristics to set them apart. The SS front fascia, for example, features an open bowtie, or “flowtie,” along with air curtains, specific headlamps, and an extractor-style hood.
The RS Appearance Package for the LT adds a polished black grille with Galvano Chrome lower inserts, new LED headlamps, LED signature light bar, specific rear fascia with rear diffuser, and 20-inch wheels. The RS and SS also receive new 20-inch wheel designs, and there are new rear fascias for each trim.

Technology Highlights
The 2019 Camaro offers a more “personalized experience” with Chevrolet’s latest Infotainment 3 interface. The automaker says it’s the most advanced infotainment system they have ever developed. The standard layout features a seven-inch diagonal color touchscreen, although an eight-inch one with navigation is available. Infotainment 3 operates similar to how a smartphone or tablet would, and features cloud capability, voice recognition, and a generous array of apps.

2018/04/07,"Ford Issues Two Safety Recalls: F-150, Expedition, Mustang, Navigator Affected","Ford is issuing a safety recall in North America for approximately 350,000 2018 F-150 and 2018 Expedition vehicles with 10-speed automatic transmissions, as well as 2018 F-650 and F-750 vehicles with six-speed automatic transmissions. The recall is for a potentially unseated transmission gear shift cable clip.
On some of the affected vehicles, a clip that locks the gear shift cable to the transmission may not be fully seated. Over time, a partially seated clip or a clip that becomes dislodged may allow the transmission to be in a gear different from the shift position selected by the driver.
This could allow the driver to move the shifter to park and remove the key, even though the transmission gear may not actually be in park. No warning message or chime would result when the driver’s door is opened. If the parking brake is not applied, this could result in unintended vehicle movement, increasing the risk of injury.
“Ford is aware of one reported accident and injury related to this condition,” the automaker said in a statement.
Affected vehicles include:
2018 Ford F-150 vehicles built at Dearborn Assembly Plant, Jan. 5, 2017 to Feb. 16, 2018.
2018 Ford F-150 vehicles built at Kansas City Assembly Plant, Jan. 25, 2017 to Feb. 16, 2018.

2018/04/05,2019 Toyota Yaris Sedan: Mid-Premium Goodness,"Here is the 2019 Toyota Yaris sedan . . . wait, they make a Yaris sedan? Why would you make a Yaris sedan? At this point, why would you make a Yaris? I keed! I keed! The Toyota Yaris is a perfectly serviceable car. No, it does not take you in Rolls-like comfort. No, it does not have Ferrari-esque power and agility. But it is a Yaris.
And at a certain point in time, maybe a Yaris is what a person needs. If you can get past the looks – and you’re going to have to, because this thing is gruesomely unattractive – but the Yaris is as dependable as, well, as a Toyota.
Mid-Premium Design
The Yaris sedan will come in three grades for 2019: L, LE, and XLE. The XLE a more a premium grade according to Toyota, although we here at Automoblog might call it “mid-premium.” The XLE offers up leatherette-trimmed front seats, which Toyota describes as “sporty” along with a leather-trimmed steering wheel, shift knob, and parking brake. The HVAC system has automatic climate control; there are automatic LED headlights, rain-sensing wipers, and illuminated entry on the mid-premium Yaris XLE.
There are newer styling touches to be found on the 2019 Yaris, like the front grille with a honeycomb insert, “upscale” piano black accents, and chrome trim. Fog lights are standard on the LE and XLE, and there’s also a new rear lip spoiler and a color-keyed shark fin antenna for the satellite radio. Power outside mirrors are standard on the L, and the LE and XLE get power outside heated mirrors with LED turn-signal indicators. And all this inexpensive yet practical goodness will come painted in seven colors.
Power & Performance
As you would expect, the 2019 Yaris is as efficient as any other Toyota out there with its six-speed automatic. The 1.5-liter engine uses direct injection and variable valve timing for 32 mpg in the city, 40 on the highway, and 35 combined. Nice! But if you opt for the six-speed manual, those figures turn into 30 mpg in the city, 39 on the highway, and 34 combined, but you do get the fun and enjoyment of stirring your own gears. Which actually should be fun thanks to the compact, lightweight design, and short-throw shift changes.
That 1.5-liter DOHC four-banger pumps out 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft. of torque, or about what a first gen GTI put out. So the Yaris should have some semblance of fun about it.
Chassis & Suspension
There’s a lot of high-tensile strength steel in the body and frame, so the chassis of the Yaris sedan should make for a rigid suspension platform. The ride is controlled via stiffer springs paired with MacPherson struts up front and a torsion beam suspension in the rear, and all you gearheads know: torsion beam rear suspension = three-wheeled corning around the AutoX course – yee-HAW!
The steering is provided by the now nearly-completely-ubiquitous electronic power steering unit. There’s a Sport mode for improved torque feel at the flip of a switch. Stopping is taken care of by ventilated discs up front and drum brakes in the rear. No, really: drum brakes and a torsion beam suspension out back. Ha!

Tech & Safety
The interior falls into the “modern car manufactured to a price point” category. Every Yaris has a seven-inch touchscreen multimedia system with voice recognition, remote interface, steering wheel controls, Bluetooth connectivity, and a standard backup camera. The speedo is analog, the tach digital, and cruise control comes standard. Every Yaris is standard equipped with an Active Safety System: Dynamic Stability Control, Traction Control System, Brake Assist, Electronic Brake-Force Distribution, Anti-Lock Brake System, and a Brake Over-Ride System.
The Low-Speed Pre-Collision System scans the road ahead for potential collisions. If the system senses something is up, an audio/visual alert and braking assistance will automatically trigger. Should you be a complete dolt and fail to respond, this system may automatically apply the brakes.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Toyota Yaris is available now with a starting MSRP of $15,450.

2018/04/05,2018 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell Arrives: What You Need To Know,"The 2018 Honda Clarity Fuel Cell is now at select Honda dealerships in California. The Clarity Fuel Cell joins a growing lineup of Honda electrified vehicles, including the 2018 Accord Hybrid and the recently announced 2019 Insight. The automaker says their goal is to have electrified vehicles represent two-thirds of their global sales by 2030.
Power & Performance
The Clarity series, which includes the Clarity Plug-in Hybrid, Clarity Fuel Cell, and Clarity Electric, each have a low, wide aerodynamic body. The Clarity Fuel cell features a Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell, 346-volt lithium-ion battery, and an AC Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Electric Motor. Honda classifies the transmission as a fixed, single-speed, direct-drive transmission with Sport mode and shift-by-wire technology.
The EPA miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe) ratings come in at 69 city, 67 highway, and 68 combined, with a refueling time of approximately three to five minutes when using 70 MPa stations. Driving range is estimated between 360 and 370 miles on average. The Clarity Fuel cell produces 174 horsepower and 221 lb-ft. of torque.
The Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety features is standard.
Pricing
With $2,868 due at signing, drivers receive their new Clarity Fuel Cell on a 36-month lease for $369 per month. While lease terms can vary, Honda is advertising a generous mileage allowance of 20,000 miles per year. The lease also includes roadside assistance, up to $15,000 of hydrogen fuel, and up to 21 days of access to a luxury vehicle from Avis, although the rental is only good in California. Golden State residents are also eligible for an additional $5,000 rebate.
Availability
Retail leasing of the Clarity Fuel Cell is available through a network of 12 approved Honda dealerships in select California markets, including six dealerships in Southern California, five in the San Francisco Bay Area, and one in the Sacramento area. Honda says as the network of public hydrogen fueling stations expands, the Clarity Fuel Cell will be more readily available.

2018/04/04,Can The 2019 Kia K900 Compete Against The Europeans?,"Here it is, the 2019 Kia K900. A car that un-ironically uses words like “classically drawn exterior” and “gravity of prestige” to describe itself. For more than four-thousand words, the Kia press release drags on and on, blah-blah luxury this, flim-flam high-tech that, worry-worry safety stuff over there. All that stuff is beside the point when you get to the part about the new K900’s powertrain and chassis.
You know what words I noticed? Albert Biermann. Yup, that Albert Biermann. The BMW tuner guy.
Kia states very flatly that the whole point of the K900 is to compete against its premium European competitors. And that phrase becomes more than marketing horse manure when you realize that Albert Biermann is the President of Kia’s Vehicle Test and High Performance Development. Yeah, the former Chief Engineer for BMW’s M performance cars with over 30 years of experience.
“The goal for the K900 was to achieve ‘confident comfort’ on the road,” he explained. “To deliver this result, we focused on four main categories: drivability, NVH, comfort, and steering precision.”
Power & Performance
The 2019 K900 is powered by a 3.3-­liter twin turbo V6, the same engine found in Kia’s much ballyhooed Stinger fastback. In the K900, it cranks out 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft. of torque, with the twin, single scroll turbos integrated directly into the exhaust manifold; Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing broadens out the power band. A cooling system described as “robust” is there to handle the increased thermal loading with a wider radiator and 600-watt fan motor.
This plant is mated to a second-gen, in-house built eight-­speed automatic operated by a Shift­-by-­Wire gear selector that allows for quicker shifts during more spirited driving. And on top of all that is full-­time “Dynamic Torque Vectoring Control,” or a standard all-wheel drive system in other words. It is electronically biased towards the rear but freely distributes torque to any and all four corners as the system sees fit. Up to 50 percent of the torque can be sent to the front and up to 80 percent of the power can be routed to the rear in Sport mode. The K900 is the second application of this in-house system with the Stinger being the first.
Ride & Handling
The wheelbase is longer and the stance wider for greater control and stability; the chassis was strengthened over the previous K900 with increased front and rear lateral stiffness thanks to a greater use of structural adhesives. Torsional stiffness is up by 33 percent over the outgoing K900; the new model has four times more hot stamping than before to give the vehicle a more solid and premium feel.
RELATED
A Rundown of Every Rezvani Beast To Date. What's Your Favorite?
The K900 utilizes a wheel air curtain to minimize vortices inside the wheel arches by introducing air from the bumper. The full underbody panels reduce drag as does an active air flap. The bottom line: a drag coefficient of .27 Cd. Noise, vibration, and harshness reduction measures are positively euro-like with enhanced insulation throughout the vehicle structure, including the firewall, under floor cover, and vibration pad behind the headliner. There’s even an acoustic film on the windshield for a quieter cabin.
Steering & Suspension
The steering itself is an electro-mechanical, rack­-mounted power assembly designed for increased agility and comfort. There’s “slower” off-center feel, which provides a better sense of stability, especially during high-speed driving. And for anyone who has ever driven a BMW, this will feel quite normal. Huh, I wonder where Kia came up with that notion?
The four-wheel independent suspension delivers tighter and quicker turns via a new front multi-link design, and by increasing the stiffness of the front and rear axle assembly. An Electronically Controlled Suspension is available to boost ride comfort. The system reduces things like chassis motion using an internal damper system to modulate the suspension accordingly.
Pricing & Availability
The new K900 will be built in Kia’s Sohari facility in South Korea, the same plant where they build the Stinger. Kia didn’t give any definite word on price but it will hit dealers in the fourth quarter of this year. In the meantime, it’s on display at the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
I’d love to get my mitts on one of these and a good, used M3 and see what the similarities are.

2018/04/03,2019 Mazda CX-3: Sign of The Times?,"Mazda recently introduced its updated CX-3 subcompact crossover before journalists at the New York International Auto Show. The CX-3 looks just like the other Mazda CXs, only squashed into a much smaller package. I’m not saying it’s a bad look or that the 2019 CX-3 doesn’t work, it’s just that you can only smush something down so far. Other than that, the new Mazda CX-3 will work out quite well in urban environments.
Minor Upgrades
And that – urban environments – is what this is all about. Although you could nominally take a Mazda CX-3 off-pavement, you wouldn’t confuse it for a Jeep. And besides, 90 percent of CX-3 owners would never do that in the first place. The new CX-3’s interior has undergone a significant revamp with the most notable new bit being the electronic parking brake. Yes, that gives you more room and allows for a significant increase in storage space, but gone will be the joys of handbrake turns in snowy parking lots. Full-leather seating surfaces are now available and redesigned seats provide drivers a more comfortable position.
The SKYACTIV-G 2.0-liter gasoline engine is said to be smoother, more efficient, and more refined. Also reduced, according to Mazda, are noise, vibration, and harshness characteristics.
Reactive Vs. Proactive
And all this is well and true and fine and good, but it’s another example of how automakers are all SUVs, all the time these days. Car makers have clocked to the fact that people love SUVs, so be it. But car makers will try and do the strangest things to try and accommodate those perceived needs. Automakers are, by and large, reactive organisms. They see a trend and respond to it. It’s hard to think of the times car manufacturers have shifted audience desires in a given direction. The only two I can think of is the Ford Mustang and the Chrysler minivans (both of which were done at the behest of Lee Iacocca, curiously enough). The Mustang started the pony car wars, of which we are still enjoying the fruits of today, and the minivan created the, er, well, it created the minivan.
But so be it. Automakers see that most Americans want an SUV – or something that can be sold as an SUV or a crossover or an “Urban Activity Vehicle” or something else condescending – and come perdition or high water, they’re going to sell it to us. This isn’t a problem. SUVs aren’t like disco music, something that was forced on the people. No, we want our SUVs, and nine times out of ten, we want them for all the wrong reasons.

Fashion Sense
So Mazda will make us a CX-3. A vehicle with limited non-pavement functionality and too small to haul anything practical. And people will buy them, and most of those people will be happy, and who am I to say they are “wrong” in their purchasing choices. People, the same slice of the market, actually, were joyously happy with minivans. Until those same people realized that driving a minivan marked you as a “suburban parent, 2.6 children, dog (small – medium), loves: Local Sports Team.” And the most practical, get-the-job-done conveyance ever devised by 1980s era man had to go.
And I should say that I am not just picking on Mazda here. A number of automakers released new SUVs during the New York International Auto Show; Acura, Lexus, Lincoln, Hyundai, and Maserati among them. It’s all about what is fashionable. Fashion. That’s why people buy SUVs, ultimately. And if the 2019 Mazda CX-3 suits your style, then have at it. It’ll work.

2018/04/03,"2019 Subaru Forester: Little Bit Bigger, Little Bit Better","Is it just me, or is the Subaru Forester getting bigger? They used to be this more upright wagon that was about the same size as the Outback (more or less), but they seem to be slowly turning into bigger and bigger SUV-like rides. And the specs from Subie on the 2019 Forester bare this out. The wheelbase is nearly two inches longer, for one thing, and there are gains in head, hip, and shoulder room. Yup, bigger.
Red Carpet
The new Forester just rolled out at the New York International Auto Show, marking the fifth generation of the Subaru SUV. The thumbnail sketch is that the 2019 Forester will come in Standard, Premium, Limited, and Touring trims, along with a new Sport trim. All versions are powered by the ever-dependable 2.5-liter four-cylinder Boxer engine. The plant is paired with a standard Lineartronic CVT; also standard (all trim levels) is Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system. Duh!
Safety & Security
Like many other car companies these days, Subaru is really focused on ladling in as much safety tech as they have available. Apart from what is now seen as “the regular safety stuff,” Subaru has also come up with DriverFocus. DriverFocus is a monitoring system that uses facial recognition software to identify signs of fatigue or distraction, and works in conjunction with Subaru’s EyeSight Driver Assist Technology to reduce the chances of an accident. A nifty little side note is that DriverFocus can also recognize up to five drivers and their presets for seat position, climate, infotainment, and such.
The rest of that safety stuff includes Automatic Pre-Collision Braking, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure and Sway Warning, Lane Keep Assist, Pre-Collision Throttle Management, and Lead Vehicle Start Alert. That’s the standard stuff. Optional safety features are Reverse Automatic Braking, Blind Spot Detection, Lane Change Assist, and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. The higher trim packages include High Beam Assist, Steering Responsive Headlights, and Trailer Stability Assist.
And lots of airbags too: front airbags, a driver’s knee airbag, front side pelvis/torso airbags, and side curtain airbags.
Connectivity & Technology
There is also lots of non-safety tech to be found in the new Forester: Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, SiriusXM, Bluetooth capability, phone connectivity, and audio streaming just to name a few. The Aha and Pandora apps are also integrated. The navigation system is built-in and voice-activated, powered by TomTom with an eight-inch, high-resolution touchscreen. The Starlink Connected Services offers remote start, a concierge service, anti-theft vehicle immobilizer with flashing security lights, and young driver safety functions including geofencing, speed alert, and curfew. Firmware updates come to your Forester over the air.

Power & Performance
All of this tech and safety is powered down the road, paved or otherwise, by a new version of the 2.5-liter Boxer four-cylinder engine, complete with direct fuel injection and higher compression. The new plant produces 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft. of torque. With the standard Lineartronic CVT, the whole package gets 33 mpg on the highway.
If you opt for the Sport or Touring, the CVT has a mode that simulates a seven-speed manual transmission with the steering wheel paddle shifters. In the middle of the drivetrain is the standard, driver-selectable SI-DRIVE that allows you to tailor the vehicle’s throttle characteristics by selecting between “Intelligent” and “Sport” modes. “Intelligent” mode helps smooth out accelerator inputs for fuel savings, while “Sport” mode tunes the throttle to emphasize performance.
Design Treatments
Subie goes into great detail on the new Forester’s design, but to me, there’s not much to go into here, which is a good thing. It’s kind of that straight up, two box design with truck-like proportions. It’s simple, non-finicky, and it works. Fuji Heavy Industries has added new colors for 2019 though: Jasper Green Metallic, Horizon Blue Pearl, and Crimson Red Pearl. You can even get a panoramic moonroof.
There’s a ton of cargo space (76.1 cubic feet), 60:40 split rear seatbacks, and the rear gate opening width is 51.3 inches wide, which is pretty big. If that’s not enough room for you, roof rails, standard on all but the base model, allow for carrying stuff like bicycles and kayaks. New tie-down hooks are integrated into the rails so all your toys can be secured more easily.
Availability & In Person
The 2019 Forester is arriving at Subaru retailers later this year. In the meantime, it’s on display at the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

2018/04/02,2019 Genesis G70 Looks To Establish Brand’s Longevity,"You know, Hyundai – okay, okay Genesis, sorry – might really be onto something here. Hyundais are, generally speaking, well made, fantastically practical cars that are ultimately disposable. Genesis, the spinoff brand from the Korean auto-giant, is just like that, only luxury-oriented and feature rich. Could there be a market out there for rich people who would not only drive a Genesis, but drive a new one every year?
Good Old Days
That used to be the way it was done, actually. I’ve personally known several old duffers who used to, every year, drive their car back to Detroit, straight to the factory, and trade it in right there, for the next such-and-such coming off the line. Now, people who are leaning that way just get a new such-and-such on lease every 12 or 24 months. Could Genesis be one of those cars? It is pretty loaded down with all that feature-frosting rich dorks demand.
Marketing Speak
Genesis officially introduced the 2019 G70 luxury performance sedan to the U.S. market at this year’s New York International Auto Show, and yeah, there’s a lot there. The G70 rounds out the Genesis sedan lineup, joining the G80, G80 Sport, and flagship G90 with all that codswallop about the brand’s “Athletic Elegance” design signature blah-blah-blah. Marketing speak, you know?
Still, the interior of the G70 is driver-focused and saturated with enough high-quality materials to choke a horse. Brushed aluminum surfaces, quilted Nappa leather seats, stainless steel speaker grilles, and premium-stitched soft-touch surfaces are all over the place. A 15-speaker Lexicon high-fidelity audio system with QuantumLogic surround-processing allows you to listen to, oh, I dunno, Slayer, in some sort of strange, false echo DSP-chip “environment.”
Power & Performance
You want power? The U.S. market G70 will have “enough.” There’s a choice of two engines: a 252 horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged inline four, and a 365 horsepower 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6. Obviously get the big mill! Rear-wheel drive is standard (baby!) and all-wheel drive is optional. The standard box is an eight-speed, sport-tuned automatic with steering wheel mounted shifters and launch control regardless of engine.
And this is actually impressive: Genesis will offer an optional six-speed manual gearbox on the 2.0 real-wheel drive model. Huzzah! Huzzah! Someone is listening to the luddite gearheads out there! Huzzah!
Ride & Handling
All G70s ride on a pretty standard MacPherson multi-link front and multi-link rear suspension. Sure there’s performance-oriented geometry dialed in, and sure, it probably corners okay, but until Genesis/Hyundai start hiring away chassis guys from Red Bull, don’t expect this thing to be a real track star. They have paid attention to overall lightness however, St. Colin of Hethel be praised.
RELATED

There’s an aluminum hood and a mechanical limited slip diff for improved traction. Variable ratio steering is on the G70 3.3 turbo, and 3.3 turbo Sport models add an electronically-controlled suspension.
The G70 is customizable to each driver’s preference with five available modes. You can tweak powertrain response, steering weight, engine sound, torque distribution, (all-wheel drive models), and suspension firmness. Brembo brakes are optional with fixed four-piston calipers up front, and two-pistons at the rear so you can stop real good. 19-inch wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires are an option as well.
Safety & Technology
Digital servants? Of course, this is a car designed and built by Koreans in 2019. There’s oodles of standard safety equipment: Forward Collision Avoidance Assist with Pedestrian Detection, Blind Spot Collision Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, and Driver Attention Warning make up the Genesis Active Safety Control suite.
Like all Genesis models, the G70 comes with advanced telematics, seamless connectivity, and nifty in-house tech goodies like Destination Search powered by Voice, Car Finder, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, Stolen Vehicle Recovery, and SOS Emergency & Automatic Collision Notification.
On top of all that, the G70 is an Amazon Alexa-enabled device with voice control.
Availability & In Person
The Genesis G70 arrives at dealers this summer and will come in eight exterior colors: Victoria Black, Casablanca White, Himalayan Grey, Santiago Silver, Adriatic Blue, Mallorca Blue, Havana Red, and Siberian Ice. In the meantime, it’s on display at the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

2018/04/02,Inside The 2019 Acura RDX,"The 2019 Acura RDX, which recently debuted at the New York International Auto Show, sees the most extensive overhaul to its platform in a decade. For 2019, the Acura RDX comes with a VTEC Turbo engine, 10-speed transmission, and an available torque vectoring all-wheel drive system. The available A-Spec variant goes further, adding sport appearance detailing both inside and out.
Walk Around
The 2019 RDX has a new look that Acura calls “sharp, low, and wide.” The RDX aims for that wide stance and sleek presence by focusing on its “wheels-out” proportions. It has that Acura signature Diamond Pentagon Grille, now flanked by Jewel Eye headlights with seven LED light elements. The wide air intakes include an NSX-inspired air curtain to feed air around the front wheels and down the body. Prominent hood bulges are visible from inside the cabin so you can always remember what a powerful SUV you have and that you’re not compensating.
The front and rear fenders have sharp character lines themselves and another aggressive character line runs the length of the RDX. The whole thing is capped off with distinctive “dragon tail” LED taillights. No, really.
Chassis & Suspension
What lies beneath the sculpted new body is also of interest. The architecture delivers a “sophisticated driving experience” thanks to a 2.6 inch longer wheelbase; cargo behind the rear seats has expanded by 3.4 cubic feet, and there’s an additional 1.7 cubic feet of under floor storage. The 2019 RDX also has a fully-flat rear floor for easy loading and unloading. That body structure is mated to an all-new chassis with variable ratio, dual-pinion electric power steering. There is a “sport-tuned” Macpherson strut suspension at the front, an all-new five-link independent rear suspension, and adaptive dampers.
Power & Performance
The new RDX is motivated by a direct-injected and turbocharged 2.0-liter, 16-valve powerplant with a DOHC VTEC valvetrain and Dual Variable Timing Cam. Power comes out at a healthy 272 ponies and 280 lb-ft. of torque; that’s up by around 10 percent versus the outgoing model. And since the torque band has been moved lower, there’s quicker acceleration and sharper throttle response.
Also in the mix is a 10-speed automatic transmission, the first and only 10 speed found in the RDX’s class – but I wouldn’t expect that to last since these ten-cog boxes are all over the truck world. Give them time to percolate down into the almost-truck-world. Acura says gear changes are quick and seamless, in both automatic mode and when using the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.

Torque Tools
Curiously enough for an SUV, the RDX comes with torque-vectoring Super Handling All-Wheel Drive. Torque vectoring is currently found on high performance exotics (Ferrari invented it) but it is a clever engineering solution that should make a welcome appearance on almost any road vehicle. Acura’s torque vectoring is a little different since it is applied to the front end to sharpen handling response, rather than applied to the rear. Although Acura points out that up to 70 percent of the torque can be sent to the rear wheels, and up to 100 percent can be distributed to either the right-rear or left-rear wheel; so that’s pretty close to what “normal” torque vectoring is.
Interior Treatments
Of course the inside is all spacious and luxurious. This is an SUV from Acura, after all. The seating comfort and lateral support improves thanks to more intricate sculpting, lightweight steel frames, and 16-way power adjustability. The standard panoramic moonroof has power slide and tilt functions and a power sliding sunshade. Brushed aluminum, stainless steel, open pore Olive Ash wood, Ultrasuede, and rich Milano leather can be slathered about the cabin as the buyer sees fit.
Acura’s True Touchpad Interface is also along for the ride and provides a system-level approach to the in-car user experience. The interface features a 10.2-inch full-HD center display and an all-new, Android-based operating system. Acura even included a padded wrist rest for a comfortable and stable platform while operating the touchpad. The new RDX also comes with a premium audio system developed by Acura and Panasonic.
Pricing & Manufacturing
The 2019 Acura RDX is available now with a starting MSRP of $38,295. The new RDX was designed at the Acura Design Studio in Los Angeles, California, developed in Raymond, Ohio, and is manufactured in East Liberty, Ohio.

2018/04/01,Want Your Next Lexus To Start? Lick The Steering Wheel. No. Seriously.,"Auto shows can be crazy places with half-thought out ideas all over the place. Gyroscope-stabilized briefcase warmers for the back seat. Cop cars with integrated doughnut dispensers. Turbine-powered iPad docks. Lots of nutty stuff that will (thankfully) never see the light of day. Sadly, Lexus and their new partner, genetic screening company 23andMe have teamed up for “Genetic Select” and it looks like they’re “serious.”
Lexus made the announcement in conjunction with the 2018 New York International Auto Show.
“Finding the perfect vehicle that meets your every need was once only a fantasy, but now it’s becoming reality,” crows Lexus inaccurately. Finding my perfect vehicle is easy guys. Finding the money for it, that’s the hard part. Genetic Select is the “Ultimate Answer to Vehicle Customization” and a revolutionary new car buying experience.
It also pegs the goofy meter.
Perfect Fit
Available on April 1st at Lexus dealerships, Genetic Select’s patented “DNA sequencing model-to-model technology” will pair drivers to a Lexus vehicle that’s tailored to their every characteristic. Lexus says with 23andMe’s understanding of genetic variants, Genetic Select will enable them to deliver the perfect color, trim, horsepower allotment, seating configuration, and radio presets, with 99.99967 percent accuracy.
“It will be impossible to tell where the driver ends and where the car begins,” reads a statement in the press release.
This is all based on the driver’s DNA, so if the customer does not have a genetic variant for bald spots, the car will come equipped with a sun roof. Those genetically prone to more freckles will receive custom window tinting.
Spit, Sign & Drive
Your Genetic Select appointment takes about 10 minutes and is sort of like the movie Gattaca. Lexus’ service staff will collect a saliva sample as quickly and painlessly as possible, then send it to 23andMe for full sequence testing. 48 hours later, the perfect vehicle will arrive at the customer’s doorstep, badda-boom badda-bing! You won’t even need a key to operate it – the revolutionary new saliva-powered start system operates via a DNA ignition sensor on the steering wheel. Just lick and drive!
Customers can make their appointments at their local Lexus dealership starting April 1st. The video below explains more.
That date again is April 1st!

2018/03/31,2019 Hyundai Santa Fe: The Most Amazing Girl In School,"I’ve always had a crush on the Hyundai Santa Fe. It’s like I am back during those awkward early high school years. My chubby cheeks and braces have returned. I’m fat. So fat. And the Hyundai Santa Fe is the girl; you know, the valedictorian who is going to a prestigious university and will become a boss lawyer. Every guy is in love with her and I suddenly, on a whim, decide to ask her to the winter formal.
Except I don’t ever get the courage to ask her out.
Friend Zone
This describes my relationship with the Hyundai Santa Fe. Despite my work in the automotive industry, I’ve never driven one. Never even been close. Never even been a passenger in one. I simply marvel from afar, even going to Hyundai dealerships after they are closed to look at them. I realize this is nuts – it’s a side effect of this profession – but the Santa Fe just really stands out to me.
Power & Performance
The new Santa Fe offers two engines: a 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder with 185 horsepower and a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 235 horsepower. Both are mated to a Hyundai-designed eight-speed automatic, a lighter more efficient transmission versus the outgoing six-speed. With the extra ratio range, expect better acceleration and fuel economy. Among the most interesting features is a multi-disc and individually-controlled hydraulic channel torque converter, said to improve responsiveness. Further, the oil pump was downsized and double ball bearings were added to minimize friction loss.
The 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe comes in both front and all-wheel drive. It’s your choice.
Related: Our comprehensive test drive and review of the 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe.
Walk Around
I admit my bias here, but a quick glance at the new Santa Fe proves just how easy it is on the eyes. Up front is Hyundai’s signature Cascading Grille, followed by a “Composite Light” design which consists of LED daytime running lamps. Hyundai says (and I laughed a bit even) the “wide stance and athletic body makes a statement from 100 feet away.” Well, yes, true but if I personally owned a Santa Fe I would never want to be a 100 feet away from it.
Again, admitting my bias – I will focus – back to our walk around.
Looking at the side, what is most noticeable is the character line that arches from the headlights to the taillights. The outside mirrors are mounted lower and further rearward and the A-pillars have decreased in size. Diamond-cut 19-inch wheels are available for a little extra flare – not exactly necessary for a family vehicle, but still nice to have.

Polestar Precept: Science Fiction or Something More?
Family Features
Here is where Hyundai really dials in, providing a number of updates and luxury touches inside. The premium treatments include a layered, three-dimensional instrument panel, contrasting seat stitching, and an aircraft-inspired heads-up display. Convenience-wise, the center screen was tilted specifically to reduce glare, the window switches and grab handles were moved forward for more elbow room, and the height and length of the center armrest grew.
The area between the first and second rows was enlarged while the floor was slightly lowered  – these design changes allow for less clutter and more legroom. Total interior volume, if you opt for the third row, is 150.7 cubic feet. Incidentally, the long wheelbase three-row version is renamed “Santa Fe XL” for 2019. However, that is soon to be replaced by the new Palisade. 
Safety is always a priority for families and the Hyundai Smart Sense package should provide peace of mind. The system includes a number of advanced safety and driver-assist systems like forward collision warning, blind spot detection, lane keeping assist, and rear cross traffic/collision avoidance.
Pricing
The 2019 Santa Fe begins at $25,500 for the front-wheel drive SE with the 2.4-liter engine; all-wheel drive SE models with the 2.4 start at $27,200. SEL and SEL Plus models will range between $27,600 and $31,500, with the Limited and Ultimate trims with the 2.4-liter running between $32,600 and $37,150.
Limited and Ultimate trims with the 2.0-liter turbo run between $34,200 and $38,800.
Each 2019 Santa Fe carries a destination and freight charge of $980.00.

2018/03/30,Maserati Levante Trofeo: Not Your “Normal” SUV. Not Even Close.,"Although they are prime commodities and hot sellers, it’s sometimes easy to dismiss SUVs and crossovers as boring and mundane. Maserati is hoping – if you hold this view – you will reconsider upon meeting the new Levante Trofeo.
“It’s proof that when you play with the elements you end up in a storm,” explained Tim Kuniskis, Chief Executive Officer, Maserati. “In the case of the Trofeo, the engineers and designers in Modena knew the driveline parameters were more than able to cope with additional power, and they also knew that Maserati had access to the finest engines on earth.”
Granted, it’s highly subjective (and infinitely debatable) at which automaker actually has the finest engines, but I understand where the passion is coming from. In fact, the Ghibli is one of my favorite cars. I absolutely adore it. I actually love all Italian cars, Maserati no exception. When I see a Maserati I get excited and the Levante Trofeo gets me excited – not Ghibli excited, but excited. Does Maserati have the finest engines on the planet? I don’t know. Maybe. But they do have, in the Levante Trofeo, one of the most powerful engines in the Italian manufacturer’s history.
Power & Performance
What we are discussing is the Levante Trofeo’s 3.8-liter Twin Turbo plant, developed in tandem with the Q4 Intelligent All-Wheel Drive System. The new engine brings with it new hardware: crankcase, crankshaft assembly, oil pump, auxiliary belt, and wiring layout – all new and enhanced in the interest of performance. The turbo flow was increased, the cylinder heads redesigned, and the pistons and connecting rods strengthened to help achieve maximum power. Even the hood is new with special vents to increase cooling.
Add it all up and the Levante Trofeo hits 62 mph in 3.9 seconds, with a top speed of 186. Between 2,250 and 5,000 rpm, a healthy 538 lb-ft. of torque is available with a max horsepower of 590. And like all Maserati gasoline engines, this latest creation is assembled by Ferrari in Maranello, Italy.
Essential Foundations
The Levante Trofeo’s 50:50 weight balance, low center of gravity, and overall chassis design help handle the high power levels. The double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension went through extensive tuning in the interest of keeping the vehicle balanced further. Maserati’s Integrated Vehicle Control system is included for the first time in a Levante to increase stability and performance.
Walk Around
It’s easy to see how the Trofeo sits at the top-of-the-line for the Levante. The font is fashioned with Full Matrix LED headlights, a unique grille with double vertical bars, and a lower honeycomb fascia. Moving to the side, the painted brake calipers (they come in multiple colors) and 22-inch wheels really stand out, and the “Saetta” Trofeo logos are a nice touch. The wheels, by the way, come in both polished and matte finishes. Your choice.

Maserati makes note of the side air intakes defined by “two aerodynamic wings” for a sense of “further stability.” In a similar fashion, the Trofeo is fitted with carbon fiber side bezel blades and a carbon fiber splitter.
The seats have a full-grain “Pieno Fiore” natural leather, available in black, red, and tan, all with contrast stitching and a “Trofeo” logo on the headrests. Pieno Fiore is renowned for its natural feel and soft character – it’s ideally suited for a vehicle of this class. Music lovers will appreciate the standard 1,280-watt, 17-speaker Bowers & Wilkins sound system. I would recommend smooth jazz, but it’s your Levante, so it’s your pick on the music.
Availability & In Person
Production begins this summer at Maserati’s plant in Mirafiori (Turin), Italy. The Levante Trofeo is initially intended for overseas export markets, including the United States and Canada. In the meantime, the Levante Trofeo Launch Edition can be seen at the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

2018/03/30,2019 Lexus UX: At Home In Any Concrete Paradise,"The 2019 Lexus UX, the SUV/crossover for well-heeled Urban eXplorers (get it?) just hit the stage at this year’s New York International Auto Show. The UX rides on two powertrains that show it’s for the city, not the country, and definitely not for going off-road in any serious way. Basically, there are two kinds: the front-wheel drive UX 200 with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a Direct-Shift CVT, and the UX 250h, which has an Atikinson Cycle version of the same 2.0-liter gas engine, coupled to a fourth-generation hybrid drive system and eAWD.
Solid Footing
The UX resides on a 103.9-inch wheelbase for a smooth, stable ride and lots of interior space. This, combined with the overall length of 177 inches and a tight turning radius, lets the UX easily fit into convenient, compact-only parking spots. The chassis is Lexus’ first use of the Global Architecture – Compact platform, which the company says is a rigid structure, with a low center of gravity for precise handling and ride comfort.
There are MacPherson struts up front and a double wishbone-type rear suspension, and both are specially tuned for a combination of “urban agility and comfort over well-worn streets.” Electric power steering is also along for the ride with a compact and rigid column assist for crisp, immediate response.
Power & Performance
That new 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine delivers 169 horsepower to the front wheels, using multi-hole direct fuel injectors, a continuously variable capacity oil pump, and variable valve-timing on the intake side. The Direct Shift-CVT also debuts in the UX 200, adding a traditional gear set (beginning from a stop) to give the UX quicker, more linear acceleration off the line. The UX 250h hybrid, on the other hand, goes with an Atkinson Cycle version of the 2.0-liter that puts out 181 total system horsepower. It gets 39 combined mpg – not bad all around.
Sadly, if somewhat predictably, the UX 250h model is the only one with all-wheel drive. But hey, these things aren’t for surviving the zombie apocalypse, so you most likely won’t miss it. The UX 250h adds an electric motor to the rear axle; power is distributed between the front and rear axles and automatically optimized when accelerating, cornering, or driving on slippery surfaces. The eAWD control system is clever enough to improve stability by introducing drag (i.e. hitting the brakes on one corner) or adding power to help correct an over or understeer situation.
Predictive Insight
The Lexus UX 250h also comes with Predictive Efficient Drive, a system that analyzes driving habits along with road and traffic conditions to optimize charging and discharging of the battery. It’s a pretty trick, if somewhat creepy system, that uses accumulated knowledge about a driver’s behavior to predict when and where the vehicle is likely to slow down or stop. Tied in with the Predictive Efficient Drive system is the Predictive State of Charge control for the battery, a thingy that uses data from the navigation system to predict the optimal times for recharging it.

Connectivity & Security
And yes, since this is the year 2019 and the UX is aimed right at you urbane urban types, it is drowning in connected tech and safety features. There’s Amazon Alexa integration to see to all your music and media needs, read you a Kindle book, and control your swank smart home devices. On board safety features include the Lexus Safety System+, Lane Tracing Assist, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Automatic High Beams, and Road Sign Assist. The vehicle can even recognize pedestrians at night and detect cyclists.
Availability & In Person
The UX will be offered through a subscription service, which should appeal to a certain younger segment of potential buyers. If you prefer the old fashioned way of buying your vehicles, the 2019 Lexus UX 250h with all-wheel drive starts at $34,000. The non-hybrid version starts at $32,000.

2018/03/30,2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt Ordering Now Open,"The 2019 Ford Mustang Bullitt was inspired by the Highland Green 1968 Mustang GT fastback Steve McQueen piloted in Bullitt now 50 years ago. As winter turns to spring, Ford dealers are ready to accept orders for the new Mustang Bullitt, a limited edition pony car with 480 horsepower.
“The new Bullitt will be every bit as cool and charismatic as the original ’68 Mustang,” said Corey Holter, Ford Car Group Marketing Manager. “Since its introduction earlier this year, Ford dealers have been fielding calls from customers wanting to know when they can order this unique piece of automotive history.”
Power & Performance
The new Mustang Bullitt features an open air intake, Shelby GT350 intake manifold, Brembo brakes, and a larger 87-millimeter throttle body. There are unique powertrain control module calibrations to help deliver the aforementioned 480 horsepower and 420 lb-ft. of torque. Top speed for the new McQueen machine is 163, an 8 mph increase versus the latest Mustang GT.
Colors & Treatments
Customers can choose between a Shadow Black or the more classic Dark Highland Green. There’s minimal badging inside and out, although the leather-trimmed interior features green accent stitching on the dashboard, door panels, center console, and seats.
Pricing & Availability
Those who opt not to order one won’t have to wait very long. The new Mustang Bullitt is expected at Ford dealerships this summer with a starting MSRP of $47,495.

2018/03/29,Lamborghini Huracán Peformante Spyder Comes To North America,"Hey! All you New Yorkers! Get down to the New York International Auto Show and take a gander at the Lamborghini Huracán Performante Spyder. It’s the first time you can view the lighter and more open-aired Huracán in the flesh, er, metal, er carbon fiber. Ah, what the heck, all a yous guys from the whole tri-state area can come take a look! Even people from Jersey!
The Huracán Peformante Spyder made its North American debut during an intimate media unveiling in the heart of New York City. I was not there since I was both busy, and now almost completely feel that New York is trying to kill me, but that’s neither here nor there.
Light & Aerodynamic
What I have gathered though is that, by and large, the design, technology, and performance features found on the Huracán Performante are found in the Spyder in the same amounts. In other words, the Spyder is just as mean and nasty and fast as its tin-top brother, but with the added party trick of a lightweight, electro-hydraulic roof that opens in just 17 seconds. And you can drop that top up to speeds of 30 mph which is so boss.
The Performante Spyder is 77 lbs. lighter than its Spyder sister, thanks to the exclusive use of Lamborghini’s Forged Composite Structure and, with the top up, it still maintains the aerodynamic slipperiness of the coupé.
The Performante Spyder also comes with the Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva system. This is a trick bit of active aero that varies the load for either high down force or low drag, as well as facilitating aero vectoring in high-speed cornering situations. All of this adds up to outstanding driving dynamics both on the track and road.
  Power & Performance
The Huracán Performante Spyder also gets an enhanced suspension, recalibrated ESC stability control, a more responsive Lamborghini Dynamic Steering system, and a permanent four-wheel drive layout for maximized traction in all situations. There is even a revised ANIMA . . . yeah, they really call it that. “ANIMA” is a driver “mode” system that customizes the setup of all the car’s dynamic systems. It comes in three settings: STRADA, SPORT, and CORSA.
Just like under the engine cover of the Performante Coupé, the Spyder has a naturally aspirated V10 engine, delivering 640 horsepower at 8,000 rpm. This plant is good enough for the Huracán Performante Spyder to accelerate to 62 mph in 3.1 seconds, and top out at 202. So yeah, it’ll blow your hair back.

2018/03/29,Fiat Goes For Extra Flare With 500 Urbana Edition,"“Fiat named one of their cars after a college town in Illinois?” I hear you asking. No, not at all, my monolinguistic friend. Urbana is the Italian word for urban. And with this latest take on their perennial city car, it’s easy to see that the Fiat 500 Urbana Edition is designed to easily fit into city living.
Style Points
The Fiat 500 Urbana Edition, which just rolled onto the stand at this year’s New International York Auto Show, exists as a way for Fiat customers to brandish their personality, and stand out from the maddening city rabble. The Fiat 500 Urbana Edition is all about style and, sadly, not performance. There’s no word on a hot rod Abarth Urbana, but how could they not, eventually? The unique styling highlights include black-trimmed exterior lights and 16-inch “hyper-black” aluminum wheels.
Special Treatments
On the inside, there are sleek interior cues all over the place, including black Sport Cloth front bucket seats with nifty silver accent stitching and a snazzy black instrument panel bezel. The Fiat 500 Urbana Edition comes in five exterior colors: Pompei Silver, Bianco White Ice, Perla White Tri-Coat, Granito Gray, and Metallo Gray. Yes, for those of you that speak Italian, that one color translates as “White White Ice” which I think was also the name for that horrid rapper from Florida, but we’ll let that slide.
X & L
The Urbana Edition is also available on the other 500 versions, the 500L and 500X. The 2018 Fiat 500L Urbana Edition, that’s the bigger version of the 500, the Longer one (although I think the L stands for Lusso) sports 17-inch black aluminum wheels, black exterior mirrors, and a black roof. The 500L Urbana Edition is available now.
The 500X somehow never got onto my radar, which is a shame because they offer an all-wheel drive version. At any rate, the 2018 500X Urbana Edition features Miron black-painted mirror caps, door handles, taillight surrounds, tailgate release, and a skid plate – so that’s more than most other Urbana variants right there. You will also find copper-accented side moldings and a special 500X logo along for the ride.
The wheels are 18-inch matte black deals that are accented with a copper center cap. You will also find Mopar side moldings on the 500X Urbana Edition. Yes, you read that right, “Mopar side moldings.” No, I don’t know what that means. And yes, I know that Fiat owns Chrysler. And yes, I am thinking the same thing you are: “Hey, if you could put Mopar side moldings on the thing, could you stuff a 383 in it??” If only!

Wishful Thinking
Everything else on the various Urbana Editions is pretty much a box-stock Fiat 500. There’s that happy-to-rev 1.4-liter MultiAir Turbo plant cranking out 135 ponies and 150 lb-ft. of torque, however. Like I said, sadly no Abarth version for the Urbana, although the regular 500 gets the scorpion badge. But no 1.4-liter mill turning out 160 horsepower and 183 lb-ft. of torque for the Urbana. Sigh.
Availability
The 2018 Fiat 500 Urbana Edition will arrive at Fiat dealers (which the company insists on calling “studios”) this spring. In the meantime, it’s also on display at the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

2018/03/29,Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport Concept: A Serious Contender?,"In some ways, VW’s Atlas Cross Sport Concept is just that: A concept vehicle at an auto show loaded with gee-wiz features. In a lot of other ways, this is just VW’s latest SUV. But the real key to the Atlas Cross Sport Concept can be found in the press materials when VW says, “Atlas five-seater shows that Volkswagen has a serious SUV strategy.”
In other words, “take our SUVs seriously.” Well, should we take the Atlas Cross Sport Concept seriously?
Up To Speed
For those out of the loop, the quick sketch is that SUVs are a big deal. People want them, for a number of reasons you don’t have to be Sigmund Freud to really figure out. And car makers want to sell them, because the profit margins are higher than traditional cars. So, bottom line: Everybody wants in on the SUV game. And Volkswagen is kind of late to the party. So, their Atlas Cross Sport Concept has to hit all the right notes and make an impression.
The Atlas Cross Sport Concept sits right in the middle of the SUV world. It’s not huge, like an Escalade, and it’s not goofy and tiny, like a Nissan Juke (if the Juke even counts). The Atlas can seat five and carry a lot of their stuff, and it looks like a modern SUV: a big, two-box design resembling a station wagon on steroids.
Just Enough
The Atlas Cross Sport Concept is 7.5 inches shorter than the run-of-the-mill Atlas, yet it keeps the same wheelbase. The most notable loss is that third row, which knocks the seating capacity down to five. So the Atlas Cross Sport Concept is not aimed at big families, but it’s still big enough for most people and most families to use most of the time. VW goes on and on about how it looks, but to my eyes, it’s rather inoffensive and generic and, if anything, there’s not much there to even criticize. What really sets VW’s Atlas Cross Sport Concept apart is the hybrid drivetrain.
Power & Performance
Volkswagen notes the Atlas is based on the company’s modular transverse matrix (MQB) platform, and that it can be “built with all manner of drive systems, including a plug-in hybrid drivetrain.” In other words, look for a bunch of engine choices across the range.
The concept uses the same 3.6-liter V6 FSI engine as the “normal” Atlas, putting out 276 horsepower and 266 lb-ft. of torque. However, that’s just the start, since output is enhanced by two electric motors “fueled” by a compact 18.0 kWh lithium-ion battery housed in the center tunnel. The front motor puts out 54 horsepower and 162 lb-ft. of torque, and the rear motor adds 114 horsepower and 199 lb-ft. of torque to the party. This means a total system power output of 355 horsepower and 1,439,294 lb-ft. of torque.
RELATED
2020 Land Rover Defender: Returning to Reclaim Lost Glory
Wait, I think my figures are a little off for the torque? Let’s just say it puts out a lot of torque, okay? Anyways, you add all that up and this VW concept hits 60 in just 5.4 seconds, topping out at 130 mph.
Drive Modes
And here’s where things get interestingly geeky and gearhead-centric. The software genies that control everything do some very interesting stuff, allowing this concept to operate in any of five modes: E-Mode, Hybrid, GTE, Off-Road or Battery Hold/Battery Charge.
The vehicle always starts out in the all-electric E-Mode if the battery is sufficiently charged. The all-electric driving range is up to 26 miles. Impressive. In E-Mode, drive power is entirely supplied by the 114 horsepower electric motor at the rear axle. Further, the gasoline engine is decoupled from the drivetrain and shut off. As soon as the software decides it needs the V6, it is recoupled to the drivetrain in an almost unnoticeable process.
When working in Hybrid mode, the V6 and/or rear electric motor automatically engage. If the battery is not sufficiently charged at this point, lifting your foot off the accelerator or hitting the brakes will turn the electric motors into generators where the energy recovered from braking is pumped into the lithium-ion battery. In GTE, which is driver-activated via a button, the throttle map, gearshifts, and steering feel sportier, and the V6 and the electric motors work together to access the full system’s power output. Ya-hoo!
If the driver activates the Off-Road mode, the Atlas Cross Sport Concept goes full-on all-wheel drive. The battery’s state of charge is low, and the front electric motor is exclusively used as a generator for the electric motor on the rear axle. This is said to give this show-car Atlas very impressive off-road ability.
Finally, the dual Battery Hold/Battery Charge mode is activated from a menu in the infotainment system. Battery Hold means the energy content of the battery stays constant and Battery Charge means the battery is charged while driving; and all this sounds quite clever. For example, you might use this mode to intentionally prep for driving in the all-electric mode.
In Person
Will this concept be built? Probably, but that’s not the point, I think. The point here is that VW could be sitting on a very flexible drivetrain that can be dropped into a large number of future vehicles. We will have to wait and see. In the meantime, the Atlas Cross Sport Concept is on display the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

2018/03/29,"Brembo Showcases Next Gen, High Performance Caliper In New York","Brembo introduced a new brake caliper for the high performance road car market during the New York International Auto Show. Brembo says the new caliper comes by way of rigorous study and a dedication to create functional products with engaging shapes. The company drew on over 45 years of Motorsport experience and over 300 racing championships as they developed the new caliper.
The goal was to create something that could match the shape, color, and exclusivity of high performance cars.
New Applications
Brembo’s engineers focused on the caliper’s geometry, reducing the mass of the areas not subjected to stress during braking. To get a better understanding on how to accomplish this, topology optimization was utilized. Topology optimization is a software tool that allowed the engineers to simulate the stiffness of the caliper and locate excess material. This application is more common for racing brakes, being used now for the first time for a cast aluminum caliper intended for road cars.
Brembo has a number of similar innovations for road-going performance cars already, including a hybrid material braking system for the 2019 Corvette ZR1.
New Benchmarks
With the minimized curves and material reduction, a weight savings of 400 grams per wheel was achieved, marking the highest ratio of weight/stiffness ever for a cast aluminum caliper for road use. Brembo says the new caliper will be used in conjunction with carbon ceramic discs and can be made in a variety of colors.
In Person
Brembo’s new caliper is equipped to the 720 horsepower Pagani Huayra, located inside their display at the New York International Auto Show, now through April 8th at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

2018/03/29,2019 Kia Sedona: Ready For The Fam,"Families that need to haul the kids, grandparents, pets, sports equipment, hiking gear, and even the kitchen sink will likely find the 2019 Kia Sedona worth looking at. Overall, the new Sedona offers a nice array of features, a solid powertrain, and plenty of functionality with its available second row Slide-N-Stow seats. Kia has also included a healthy dose of advanced safety technology for added peace of mind.
Walk Around
We immediately see the long, slender proportions and Kia’s “tiger nose” signature grille up font. LED headlamps are standard on SX and SXL trims and around back, the rear combination lamps – with a new graphic – complete the liftgate’s restyled chrome garnish. The newly-designed 17-, 18-, and 19-inch wheels vary based on trim.
Getting in is easy with the power-sliding doors and, once inside, there are lots of tech features. Of note: the available rear-seat entertainment system for long trips. This option provides 10.1-inch dual touchscreens, located on the back of the front seats, versus the single overhead screen in prior models. The system also allows internet access via the user’s compatible smartphone.
For those weekend-long tailgating parties and camping adventures, an available USB port can be added to the luggage area; it’s also accessible for third-row passengers. Bonus!
Power & Performance
The 2019 Kia Sedona features a 3.3-liter V6 (Gasoline Direct Injection) paired to an eight-speed automatic. One of the engine’s defining characteristics is the Variable Induction System, which improves “breathing” by automatically adjusting the intake runner lengths to optimize torque under different load conditions. In essence, drivers get a more responsive minivan. The new eight-speed transmission will help with this too.
The engine creates a respectable 276 horsepower and 248 lb-ft. of torque, although don’t expect to keep up with the Kia Stinger.
Safety & Security
This is a priority for families and it looks like the 2019 Kia Sedona is prepared. Advanced driver assistance systems include Forward Collision Warning, Smart Cruise Control with Stop & Go, Rear Cross Traffic Collision Warning, Blind Spot Collision Warning, and Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist.
Furthermore, the 2019 Sedona now offers Driver Attention Warning. The system is designed to detect when driver concentration has waned by monitoring vehicle and driving behavior. If driver fatigue or inattentive driving is detected, the system employs visual and audible warnings.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Kia Sedona is available now for a starting MSRP of $27,200. The new Sedona is offered in five trim levels: L, LX, EX, EX Premium, SX, and SXL.

2018/03/28,Genesis Essentia Concept: Challenging The Status Quo,"Genesis is displaying the Essentia Concept at the New York International Auto Show. The Essentia is the brand’s first battery electric vehicle and provides a glimpse of where Genesis is heading with regard to design and technology.
“We understand our obligation as a luxury car manufacturer to create objects of desire, sparking passion and inspiration by emphasizing a culture while exceeding expectations in terms of technology and connectivity, bringing our outside world seamlessly to the inside of the vehicle,” explained Manfred Fitzgerald, Global Head of the Genesis Brand. “This is what the Genesis Essentia Concept is all about.”
Athletic DNA
Genesis wants to challenge the “status quo” for Gran Turismo cars with the Essentia. With its lightweight, carbon fiber construction, multi-motor electric powertrain, and custom-tailored interior, Genesis is pushing for something both beautiful and capable. The company’s internal philosophy of “Athletic Elegance” played heavily into the design and engineering of the Essentia; the Gran Turismo proportions are seen in the long bonnet, swept-back cabin, and lower stance.
“The Genesis Essentia concept defines our vision for an electric Gran Turismo that integrates Athletic Elegance and Genesis DNA as defining parameters,” said Executive Vice President Luc Donckerwolke, Head of Genesis Design. “A Gran Turismo typology highlights our ambition as a luxurious car brand for the connoisseurs and it is the perfect base to project our DNA in the future.”
Walk Around
We notice the front is dominated by the “Genesis Crest Grille,” a brand signature. The hood is transparent so we can see the carbon fiber chassis and pushrod suspension. Intakes positioned left and right of the Crest Grille function as air curtains, pushing airflow around the front corners. Functional air outlets are also located just behind the front wheels to reduce pressure buildup and drag.
Moving around the Essentia, we see what Genesis dubs the “anti-wedge parabolic line,” or a design characteristic that provides visual structure to the body while emphasizing length. At the rear, we notice an aerodynamic surface and special Quad Lights.
“The search for dynamic proportions was contrasted with advanced aerodynamic flows to highlight the bionic combination of performance and aesthetics,” Donckerwolke said. “Essentia embodies the genetic elements of the Genesis design.”
Getting inside is uniquely science fiction; the Essentia actually has B-pillar fingerprint controls and biometric facial recognition for opening and closing the doors. Once settled, drivers are treated to Cognac leather seats with chevron quilting; just ahead is an eight-inch display operated by a jewel-like central controller.
Power & Performance
There is certinately a lot more than what Genesis is telling us, but what we do know is the significance of how the battery pack is laid out. Genesis says it’s “housed in the center tunnel in an I-shape structure” versus underneath the passenger compartment. According to the automaker, this allows the Essentia to maintain its signature look without compromising interior space.

The one spec Genesis does volunteer is the estimated zero to 60 time of three seconds.
Technology & Connectivity
There is a lot here too, but the short version is that Genesis wants the Essentia to be connected to the world around it. Perhaps as a precursor to fully automated driving, the Essentia includes advanced machine learning and vehicle-to-infrastructure/vehicle-to-vehicle technology. If a driver has a “smart home,” the Essentia can program the HVAC settings, turn on the lights – even allow for deliveries.
What a time to be alive.

2018/03/28,2018 Audi RS 5: The Big Boost RS,"In Audi lingo, all their cars are named A-something. You’ve got your A4s and A6s and such. If you want the performance models, that A gets changed to an S; A6s turns into S6s and they go much faster. If that’s not enough for you, Audi will make the RS version of something, and this is where things get really out of hand. Audi RSs make big power and get big blowers stuffed into ever-smaller engine bays with delicious results.
To wit: The new Audi RS 5 Coupe which delivers 444 horsepower and 443 lb-ft. of torque. That’s 126 lb-ft. of torque more than the previous generation. Impressive.
Power & Performance
All that power and grunt is made the old fashioned RS way: with two big turbos. In the case of the 2018 Audi RS 5, that would be a newly-developed 2.9-liter V6 TFSI bi-turbo plant. It already weighs 68 lbs. less than the naturally aspirated 2.9 from the previous version, which is amazing given all the added turbos and plumbing and whatnot. Still, the RS 5 can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, a pick up of eight tenths over the outgoing RS 5. Top speed is 155 mph, and if you opt for the Dynamic Plus package, that rises to 174 mph. My advice: Go for the Dynamic Plus package!
Did I use the term “big boost?” If I didn’t, I should have, ’cause dig this: 21.5 PSI. That’s how much pressure the new Audi RS 5 is cranking out. I’d love to see the air/fuel graph on this guy, because they have to be running it lean as broth. That is a lot of pressure in the cylinder that’s already running a compression ratio of 10.0:1 The heat loading must be massive, and somehow, Audi follows that current design fad of tucking the turbos and all that plumbing directly inside the “V” of the engine. Sure, you get all the benefits like improved engine responsiveness and performance, but that engine compartment must be hotter than a pistol in Doc Holliday’s hand.
All the power from the bi-turbo engine flows into an eight-speed Tiptronic transmission with a self-locking center diff, and a full traction control system for maximum acceleration with minimal slip. This is the quattro all-wheel drive system baby, you best hang on. 60 percent of the torque goes to the rear axle and the rest to the front, so slightly tail out cornering is there to be had. The standard rear diff gets RS-specific tuning and actively splits the torque between the rear wheels.

Suspension & Braking
The suspension is redesigned and lightweight with a five-link (front) setup for greater steering precision. The Audi RS 5 coupe sits 7 mm lower than the S5, and has Dynamic Ride Control with adjustable dampers connected to one another via diagonal oil lines for better handling. The valves regulate the oil flow of the deflected outside front wheel almost immediately to reduce pitch and roll. Trick!
There is also the standard Audi drive select system which offers four modes. The modes allow you to adjust the differential, steering, and ride control, in addition to changing shift points and steering and throttle responses. The brakes, always an Audi strong suit, are as impressive as you’d expect. You get your choice of two different brake sets: RS steel brakes with cross-drilled discs and six-piston front brake calipers, or the top-of-the-line carbon ceramic front brakes which, obviously, save weight and provide superior stopping power.
Yes, the body and interior have been redesigned. All of this is subjective, but personally I’d call the new 2018 Audi RS 5 more purposeful looking than beautiful. Although that shade of green is gorgeous!
Styling & Tech Treatments
Inside, the flat-bottom three-spoke steering wheel has RS badging and enlarged shift paddles. The seats are heated, adjust 12-ways, have contrast diamond-stitched leather/Alcantara coverings with RS embossing, power side bolsters, and even a massage function. Aluminum, illuminated door sill inlays with RS 5 logos remind you how special you are for having this car.
More? Yes, much more: The 2018 Audi RS 5 coupe includes collision mitigation, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic assist, adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, active lane assist, and high beam assistant. It’s literally soaking in tech features and driver “assist” nannies.
Pricing & Availability
Best of all, the 2018 RS 5 Coupe is available now with a starting price of $69,900 – which is not that bad, considering what you get and how fast and powerful the new RS 5 is.

2018/03/27,Waymo & Jaguar Land Rover To Create Self-Driving Fleet,"Jaguar Land Rover and Waymo announced a strategic partnership to develop self-driving I-PACE electric vehicles for Waymo’s autonomous transportation service. The companies say the collaboration will strengthen their shared goals of making safe cars and increasing mobility for all populations. Testing will begin later this year.
“While we’ve been focused at Waymo on building the world’s most experienced driver, the team at Jaguar Land Rover has developed an all-new battery-electric platform that looks to set a new standard in safety, design, and capability,” said John Krafcik, Chief Executive Officer, Waymo.
Engineers from both Waymo and Jaguar Land Rover will use the testing data to refine the technology. The companies say the partnership focuses on safety and reliability, two things that have come into question recently after an Arizona woman was struck and killed by a self-driving vehicle.
Once testing is complete, up to 20,000 I-PACE vehicles will be built during the first two years, and be available for riders of Waymo’s driverless service. In the meantime, the Waymo Jaguar I-PACE will be shown at the 2018 New York International Auto Show, which opens to the public on Friday, March 30th.

2018/03/27,55 MPG Expected For 2019 Honda Insight,"The 2019 Honda Insight can finally be seen at this year’s upcoming New York International Auto Show. Honda says the 2019 Insight has robust acceleration and competitive fuel efficiency thanks to its new hybrid drivetrain. Joining the Clarity series and the 2018 Accord Hybrid, the new Insight is the fifth Honda electrified vehicle introduced over the past year. The all-new Insight will provide a fresh look for Honda’s expanding lineup of electrified vehicles.
Premium Treatments
The Insight, a compact sedan, is positioned and priced between the Civic and Accord in Honda’s lineup, and aims to offer a unique level of packaging, refinement, and efficiency. The design aims to be sleek with a low and wide stance, bold front fascia, low-profile LED headlights and taillights, sharp character lines, and a sweeping, coupe-like, roofline. On the inside, drivers will find premium cabin appointments such as a soft-touch instrument panel, ergonomically sculpted seats, a large-ish seven-inch TFT color “digital driver’s meter,” and heated, leather-trimmed seats. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also built-in.
Chassis & Suspension
The new Insight rides on a comparatively long wheelbase of 106.3 inches. That means you get both a nice ride and excellent packaging for a spacious 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space. Honda accomplished this – a tricky feat to pull off in a hybrid – by placing the lithium-ion hybrid battery pack beneath the rear seats. Not only do you get a normal-sized trunk, but the Insight also comes with a 60/40-split fold-down rear seat to maximize cargo – and people – hauling flexibility.
The Insight shares the same basic platform as the tenth-gen Civic, which helps explain why the Insight has that premium compact sedan feel. The body features an aluminum hood to cut weight, while additional sound insulation in the engine bay, front fenders, front firewall, and front and rear floors help create a tranquil cabin. The new Insight also features Honda’s Advanced Compatibility Engineering body structure.
The chassis is designed for a refined, confident, and composed driving experience according to Honda. There’s a fully-independent suspension system with a Macpherson strut front end, and a multi-link rear setup; the high-trim Touring models have liquid-sealing compliance bushings at both ends. The electric power steering is a variable-ratio dual-pinion deal and there’s an electro-servo brake system, which combines regenerative braking with the normal mechanical brake system for better stopping performance.
Power & Performance
Speaking of that hybrid system, it all starts with an efficient 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle engine that is coupled to a powerful electric propulsion motor and a lithium-ion battery pack. Total output is 151 horsepower and 197 lb-ft. of torque with up to 55 mpg in the city, according to Honda’s internal certification testing.

Under most conditions, the Insight operates as a series hybrid, like a railroad locomotive: The gasoline engine, connected to the generator motor, produces electricity that is supplied to the electric propulsion motor or to the 60-cell lithium-ion battery pack. There are three drive modes for the new Insight: NORMAL, ECON, and SPORT. You can pick and choose which one suits you, your mood, or the conditions. All Insights have steering wheel-mounted deceleration selectors so you can choose from three levels of regenerative braking performance as well.
Availability & In Person
The 2019 Honda Insight comes in three trim levels: LX, EX, and the top-of-the-line Touring; the Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety and driver-assistance tech comes standard. It will arrive at Honda dealers later this year, but will be on display for the duration for the 2018 New York International Auto Show which opens to the public on Friday, March 30th.

2018/03/24,2019 Cadillac CT6 V-Sport: A New Species Emerges,"Cadillac has unveiled the 2019 CT6 V-Sport, the first-ever V-Performance version of its top sedan. The new CT6 V-Sport actually coincides with an ongoing makeover of the entire CT6 lineup; said makeover will usher in the design cues first seen on the Escala Concept. With the new CT6 V-Sport, Cadillac is definitely swinging for the fences.
“The CT6 V-Sport was developed for driving enthusiasts who want the best of both worlds: a high-performance sports sedan and a luxury car with all the comforts and technology that come with it,” said Lyndon Lie, CT6 Chief Engineer.
Power & Performance
The CT6 V-Sport is not the car you want to make angry at a stop light. Under the hood is a new 4.2-liter Twin Turbo V8, Cadillac’s first engine of this kind in its history. It’s described as a “clean-sheet design” in a performance-oriented and mass-efficient package. This is best seen in what Cadillac refers to as the “hot V” residing at the center of the engine. The setup is another first for Cadillac.
The configuration transposes the conventional layout of the cylinder heads’ intake and exhaust systems, with the turbochargers mounted at the top of the engine, or “in the valley between the heads.” This, according to Cadillac, cuts turbo lag and reduces the engine’s overall packaging size. There are a lot of things one could say about the CT6 V-Sport but the engine is one of the car’s strongest character traits.
“It is the centerpiece of the new CT6 V-Sport, an engaging sport sedan infused with the DNA of Cadillac’s world-renowned and championship-winning motorsports program,” explained Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen. “Cadillac V-Sport is the embodiment of our passion to deliver an exhilarating driving experience without compromises.”
Horsepower is estimated at or around the 550 range, with torque coming in at about 630 lb-ft. A mechanically-controlled limited-slip rear differential increases traction and performance, especially while on the track.
“With its lightweight architecture, an all-new Cadillac Twin Turbo V8, coupled with the tightened suspension and revised AWD torque split, we’ve enhanced the CT6 to be well-balanced and capable in all conditions,” Lie added.
Transmission Tech
The new engine is matched with a 10-speed automatic transmission (10L90 Hydra-Matic). The 7.39 overall gear ratio spread enhances off-the-line performance but lowers engine speeds on the highway for efficiency. Narrow steps between the gear ratios help create maximum power at nearly any speed.
Ride & Handling
Cadillac didn’t give many details but expect an enhanced variation of GM’s evergreen Magnetic Ride Control. The steering has been “re-mapped” for more dynamic feedback, while an Active Rear Steer feature was added. There is also a list of “track-focused” stability controls, although Cadillac did not elaborate as to what they were. The V-Sport is modified with “specific suspension tuning” for improved roll control and cornering capability. Cadillac again did not elaborate, unfortunately.
RELATED

19-inch Brembo brakes were developed specifically for the CT6, complete with performance linings and air deflectors that direct air to cool the brakes during aggressive driving.
Connectivity & Technology
V-Sport aside, CT6 buyers can expect a lot (and we mean a lot) of in-vehicle tech. Cadillac’s in-car system reacts similar to a smartphone, so getting onto it should be relatively easy. The system’s central display is a 10-inch diagonal interface and can be updated over time to meet a customer’s connectivity needs, should they change. It leverages the cloud and an available 4G LTE connection to enable a number of personalized infotainment choices like navigation or news. The rear-seat infotainment system even has media inputs through USB, HDMI, or Wi-Fi connections to a phone.
Other tech features for the CT6 include the Rear Camera Mirror which has zoom and tilt functions, and a Surround Vision Recorder that provides 360 degrees of recording when the security system is activated. Naturally, the Cadillac CT6 has a wide range of driver aids like Front Pedestrian Braking, Rear Pedestrian Detection, and Night Vision.
Pricing & Availability
Cadillac has not disclosed either, just that the CT6 V-Sport is coming for the 2019 model year. The vehicle will be built at Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Hamtramck, Michigan.

2018/03/24,Inside The 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback,"Hot hatch fever is going around and Toyota has caught the bug! Meet the 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback, which the automaker says has “flair extraordinaire.” Indeed that seems to be the case, especially in that bright blue. The new Corolla Hatchback has Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa connectivity, a revised sport-tuned suspension, and a host of advanced safety features.
Let’s take a look at the rest of the 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback.
Platform & Architecture
The 2019 Corolla Hatchback resides on the automaker’s TNGA C platform, also referred to as Toyota’s New Global Architecture. The compact structure employs a mixture of adhesives, spot welding, and additional bracing to boost fuel economy and on-road stability. The platform makes use of aluminum and high- and ultra-high tensile strength steels, improving torsional rigidity by 60 percent when compared to its predecessor, the Corolla iM. Likewise, the new hatchback is lower by an inch, wider by 1.2 inches, and longer by 1.5 inches.
Toyota uses a number of sound-absorbing materials, sealants, foams, resonator ribs, and silencers to reduce unwanted cabin noise. The actual hatch is made from Toyota’s Super Olefin Polymer and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene – both materials are lightweight to help with fuel efficiency. The hatch was moved 14 degrees forward for a more sporty look.
Power & Performance
The new Corolla Hatchback should be a responsive little machine with its 2.0-liter Dynamic-Force inline four engine. Complete with direct injection, it’s smaller and lighter than the 1.8-liter it replaces. A more rigid crank case with an integrated stiffener, a lighter resin cylinder head, and a ribbed oil pan further reduce unwanted noise and vibrations.
The engine, known in Toyota-speak as M20A-FKS, has the automaker’s latest D-4S fuel-injection technology. The system uses high-pressure direct-injection and low-pressure Port Fuel Injection, and can adapt the injection cycle based on driving conditions so ideal combustion is always achieved. The engine also features Dual VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing-intelligence) on the exhaust side and VVT-iE (Variable Valve Timing-intelligence by Electric motor) on the intake side. VVT-iE uses an electric motor instead of oil pressure to control the variable valve timing.
Together, the systems enhance power output and fuel mileage, but cut emissions.
Although horsepower and torque figures are forthcoming, Toyota put a laundry list of work into the new engine. For example, the valve nip angle has been enlarged and the stroke is longer. Toyota says these changes, along with laser clad valve seats, provide higher compression and air intake volumes. Similarly, the pistons with their rounded top surface and slanted side walls reduce knocking and friction, but keep compression high. Toyota also notes the high-strength steel connecting rods, lighter timing chain, and how each cylinder receives three separate oil jets.

Transmission Tech
Like the engine, the Dynamic-Shift CVT received an extensive amount of work. It emulates a 10-speed, has a sport mode and paddle shifters, and comes with a slick feature known as a “launch gear.” Toyota says this helps in lower gear ratios where belt efficiency is typically poor in a CVT. Essentially, the transmission utilizes something called “gear drive” for stronger acceleration from a stop. The belt angle was narrowed and the pulley diameters reduced, creating 20 percent quicker shifts.
Drivers can also opt for a six-speed manual gearbox with downshift rev-matching control.
Ride & Handling
The car’s front MacPherson setup has been tweaked – i.e. updated bound stopper clearance and stabilizer locations – while other modifications include a revised coil spring rate and damping force. At the rear are updated shock absorbers and springs, and like the front, the geometry is slightly modified. Lower arm locations have moved for improved toe-in angles at higher speeds, and the shock absorbers have moved forward for better cargo capacity.
Toyota also took measures to reduce friction (by 40 percent) in all the sliding parts.
In-Car Technology
A high-resolution, eight-inch multimedia touchscreen houses the vehicle settings, audio controls, navigation, smartphone functions, and the Entune 3.0 apps. The premium Entune package adds an eight-speaker, 800-watt JBL stereo with Clari-Fi, voice recognition, navigation, and various search and connect features. The JBL stereo is really cool with its A-Pillar mounted tweeters and 6.7-inch door subwoofers. Wireless phone charging is a nice added bonus.
The second generation of Toyota Safety Sense is also standard.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback is available now and starts at $19,990. If you’re interested, here is our full review of the vehicle. It did lack in a few key areas performance-wise when we drove it, but overall we really liked it.

2018/03/24,"Ford & Mahindra To Develop SUVs, Electric Vehicles & Connected Car Technologies","Ford Motor Company and the Mahindra Group have signed five agreements to develop new SUVs and small electric vehicles. Ford and Mahindra announced their strategic partnership in September of 2017, saying both companies were focusing on mobility programs, connected vehicle initiatives, and electrification strategies. The partnership will also explore sourcing and commercial efficiencies, and product development in general. Ford hopes to gain traction in India as well, an emerging automotive market.
“Ford is committed to offering the best vehicles, technologies, and services that fit the lifestyles and preferences of Indian consumers,” said Jim Farley, Ford Executive Vice President and President of Global Markets.
Joint Development Plans
  Under these latest initiatives, Mahindra and Ford will co-develop a midsize SUV both companies can sell independently as separate brands. The forthcoming SUV will be built on a Mahindra platform but both will explore sharing powertrain portfolios. The two companies will also examine the possibility of developing a compact SUV and an electric vehicle, along with a range of connected car technologies.
“Listening to our customers and incorporating their future needs is the core premise of this collaboration,” Farley added. “With utility vehicles and electrification as key focus areas, we are glad to see the progress our two companies have made.”
Continued Expansion
Overall, the strategic alliance will leverage Ford’s global reach and Mahindra’s scale in India. Ford entered India in 1995 and remains one of the country’s largest exporters. India is also the second-largest Ford employee base globally, with more than 14,000 working across the Ford India or Global Business Services operations in New Delhi, Chennai, and Coimbator. Likewise, Mahindra has lead the utility vehicles segment in India for seven decades. The Mumbai-based manufacturer owns a majority stake in the Ssangyong Motor Company in Korea, and has invested in ridesharing platforms in the United States.
“Both teams are working together on joint development areas in keeping with industry requirements and leveraging mutual strengths,” explained Dr. Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. “We are excited about the synergies unveiled through this collaboration and the potential opportunities it will bring.”

2018/03/23,Black Is The New Black: GMC Special Editions Coming,"GMC fans will receive a new trim package later this year. The 2019 Terrain and Acadia Black Editions give buyers a little extra flare from the factory. The GMC Black Editions arose after company officials reviewed internal data showing roughly one in five new SUV buyers spends extra money to personalize their vehicle.
“The new Terrain and Acadia Black Editions perfectly capture the identity of the GMC brand by offering a bold and confident exterior appearance,” explained Duncan Aldred, Vice President of Global GMC. “They give our customers more choices within the premium SUV segment to distinguish their vehicle and themselves.”
As the name would suggest, the Black Editions are characterized by their darkened exterior treatments.
Terrain Black Edition
Available on SLE and SLT grades, the package includes 19-inch gloss black aluminum wheels and a darkened grille insert. There are black mirror caps, roof rails, and badging, along with other exterior accents. The 2019 GMC Terrain Black Edition will be offered in five colors: Ebony Twilight Metallic, Summit White, Graphite Gray Metallic, and Satin Steel Metallic. A new Sedona Metallic will be available later on.
Acadia Black Edition
Available on SLT grades, the package features 20-inch machined aluminum wheels with black accents, a black grille insert, and black headlamp and taillamp details. Similar to the Terrain, the Acadia Black Edition comes in five colors: Ebony Twilight Metallic, Summit White, and White Frost Tricoat. Dark Sky Metallic and Smokey Quartz Metallic are new for 2019.
Pricing & Availability
The GMC Black Editions will be available this summer. GMC has not yet announced pricing, although expect it to be competitive relative to other special edition SUVs on the market. GMC crossovers were up 19 percent in February alone, with the Terrain posting a 17 percent year-over-year increase, and the Acadia was up 22 percent.

2018/03/23,These Very Stylish Infiniti Vehicles Are Headed To The Big Apple,"Infiniti will roll into the New York International Auto Show with two specially-equipped SUVs. The 2019 QX60 and QX80 Limited will have more premium appointments than their non-Limited counterparts, and will serve to bolster sales for both product lines. Infiniti has been making the rounds on this year’s auto show circuit, showcasing their SUVs in particular.
The automaker says the Limited versions of the QX60 and QX80 have treatments that were “designed to make a statement.” Here is a rundown of what those treatments are – it’s up to you if they actually make a statement.
2019 QX60 Limited
The QX60, already one of Infiniti’s top sellers, receives a dark chrome front grille and fog lamp finishers in its Limited skin. The roof rails and cross bar have a darker coat of premium paint, and the rear bumper is covered in a gloss black tint. A “Limited” rear badge denotes this QX60 from the rest of the pack as it rides on 20-inch dark aluminum-alloy wheels.
Luxury treatments on the inside include leather-wrapped grab handles, dark silver wood accents, and a black headliner and pillars. All three rows feature a stone-colored semi-aniline leather with quilting, perforation, and contrast stitching and piping. It even comes with special floor and cargo mats with metal logos. Why? Because Limited!
Like all QX60s, the Limited is powered by a 3.5-liter V6, creating 295 horsepower and 270 lb-ft. of torque.
2019 QX80 Limited
Drivers who demand large and luxurious will likely opt for the QX80 Limited. This big mother rides on dark machine-finished, 22-inch forged aluminum-alloy wheels. Note the stainless steel running boards with rubber grips so drivers can actually get inside the vehicle.
And once inside, Infiniti says the “resemblance to a modern luxury space is purely intentional.” Thank goodness because we at this publication look poorly on automakers who unwittingly make their vehicles nice inside. That said, the 2019 QX80 Limited will feature two-tone semi-aniline leather and Alcantara-appointed seats, which come with their own special quilting, contrast piping, and stitching. The steering wheel and shift knob are leather-wrapped and matte silver open-pore Ash wood runs throughout. There’s even “branded welcome lightning” becasue Limited.
Those with a growing family may appreciate the available seating for seven. In this configuration, the second row has captain’s chairs whereas the third row becomes a bench. Also for the family, an available Theater Package has headrest screens for rear passengers who want to play a game or binge watch a show.
The 5.6-liter V8 creates 400 horsepower and 413 lb-ft. of torque, and powers either the rear or both axles, the latter being known as “All-Mode 4WD.” The four-wheel drive system operates via a dial on the center console. Infiniti says this provides four-wheel traction when conditions require and off-road capability when the driver needs it.

2018/03/20,2019 Audi A6 To Feature Technology You Can Interrupt,"The 2019 Audi A6 will make its U.S. debut at the upcoming New York International Auto Show. Audi promises the new A6 will offer the latest technology, better driving dynamics, and increased comfort. The interior of the new A6 is larger than the outgoing model too, so occupants can look forward to more head and shoulder room. In advance of the festivities in New York, here is what we know so far about the 2019 Audi A6.
Touch & Go
The new Audi A6 is a rolling bin of tech-goodness, starting first with the MMI touch response system. The rotary dial and traditional controls from the previous model are gone in favor of two high-resolution displays. The MMI touch response operates in a familiar fashion, through the use drag-and-drop features. The menu structure, including the search function, works like a smartphone, and the main menu tiles and direct access bar can be configured individually. Over 30 shortcut buttons can be stored so drivers can configure their own preferences.
Both displays have special, anti-fingerprint coatings and anti-glare layers, making them easier to clean and see. The outermost layer is tempered so it’s more scratch-resistant.
Talk & Go
The 2019 Audi A6 will take spoken requests and commands from drivers. This can include speaking things like “I’m cold” or “call Emily” or “where is the nearest coffee shop?” In each instance, the 2019 Audi A6 will respond accordingly, with things like “what temperature would you like to set the cabin to?” The dialogue manager will ask clarifying questions if necessary and offer other choices if applicable.
Audi also, quite hilariously, says the system “accepts being interrupted.”
Mobility Management
The myAudi app, launching later this year, offers A6 owners a special feature called myAudi Navigation. Essentially, the route to a given destination can be passed back and forth between the driver’s phone and their A6. Said route could begin on a smartphone, but continue through the car’s on-board system once the vehicle is started.
Power & Performance
Audi is slim on the details, but they do say “innovative suspension solutions” make the new A6 “noticeably more dynamic.” A new damping system is said to provide more precise feedback and higher levels of comfort, be it a cruise around town or a long jaunt on the highway.
An all-new turbo V6 is paired with a new 48-volt mild-hybrid system, which supports the engine and serves as the vehicle’s primary electrical source.
Styling & Design
While such things are always subjective, the A6 does showcase Audi’s latest design language. Following the cues of the A8 and A7, the 2019 A6 is characterized by larger surfaces, nicely sculpted edges, and visible body lines. From the side, three distinctive lines actually reduce the visual height of the A6. The roof line, which tapers into the flat C-pillars, encompasses the silhouette while the shorter trunk ends in a curved edge for better aerodynamic performance.

2018/03/20,McLaren Senna GTR: A Really Fast Car With A Face Only A Mother Could Love,"This is the McLaren Senna GTR, the track-only version of the McLaren Senna hyper-road car. And it is, somehow, even worse looking than the street version. Look, I know that Borrum demands you make certain aerodynamic sacrifices upon their altar, but if this is the result, perhaps you should start questioning your god’s aesthetic decisions. Seriously.
Power & Performance
Air can do fantastic things, if you know how to treat it. In the case of the McLaren Senna GTR, it can screw its plug-ugly ass down to the tar-Macadam of a race track with 2,205 lbs. of downforce. That aero-capability combines with a weight around 2,641 lbs., and even more power and torque from the 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 found in the road car, which already puts out an upsetting 789 horsepower and 590 lb-ft. of torque. With a bump now to at least 814 horsepower, the Senna GTR will be considerably faster in a straight line.
Combine all that with a race-style transmission (I’m figuring a full dog box set up), revised double wishbone suspension, and full-on Pirelli race slicks, and it’s easy to believe McLaren when they say the Senna GTR posts the quickest McLaren circuit lap times other than a Formula 1 car. The Senna GTR uses the same carbon fiber Monocage III structure as the road-going version, which still provides more than enough core strength and rigidity for a out-and-out track car. The rest of the technical specs will be confirmed later this year.
Form & Function
“Form follows function” is the McLaren design philosophy, which I would love to see here, but all I can clock to is how the McLaren Senna GTR looks like a drawing on little Mikey Bay’s notebook, circa 8th grade. It is somehow worse than the normal Senna’s catalogue of bad design ideas only with tacky race graphics added. The Senna GTR does have a wider track and new fenders, front and back, with a new wheel design specifically for circuit use. For what that’s worth.
The front splitter of the McLaren GTR is a hilariously over-done and over-extended affair that, combined with the side skirts, has about the surface area of 1.1 pool tables. Obviously that Wyoming-sized-and-shaped splitter is larger than the road-car version (duh!) and contributes to improved front aerodynamic performance (also duh!). Add to this list the rear diffuser, which is both larger and extends further back. The rear deck sits lower than any previous McLaren, which aids aerodynamic performance.
Woking even took a crack at the doors, pushing the outer skin in as far as possible towards the center of the car so airflow is better channeled. There’s also that race track standard polycarbonate “ticket” window, which is not found on the road-legal McLaren Senna.
All You Need
All of this is part of McLaren’s focus on giving customers a track-fixated version across their full range of cars. McLaren has even gone so far as to start a single-make race series as part of the Pure McLaren track events. Yes, Pure McLaren. All you need is an International D-grade comp license and McLaren takes care of everything else. It’s a full “arrive and drive” setup that currently starts with the race-prepped 570S GT4. Oh, and money, it takes that too. Lots of it. Yup, you only need three things: an International D-grade competition license, your McLaren, and money. Boxcars and boxcars of money.

Pricing & Availability
If you want to buy one (and most of you would I’d bet) you can contact McLaren, as they’d be more than interested in talking with you about spending vast quantities of your money. “Expressions of interest” (which is about the most British thing I’ve read today) were taken at this year’s Geneva Motor Show and those “expressions of interest” can still be expressed up to 75 confirmed orders, then they shut off the factory line in Woking, England where the car will be hand-assembled. Each will be priced around $1.4 million.

2018/03/19,2018 Honda Accord Hybrid Heading To Dealerships,"The 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid arrives in dealerships this week (Friday, March 23rd) as a pinnacle vehicle of sorts for the automaker. With the new Accord Hybrid, Honda is promising a list of class-leading features, including performance, interior room, and cargo space. As the latest in Honda’s growing portfolio of electrified vehicles, the 2018 Accord Hybrid will likely appeal to a wider audience with its five distinct trim levels.
Standard Equipment
At just shy of $26,000 for a starting MSRP, the new Accord Hybrid offers a nice array of standard items: 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and taillights, dual-zone climate control, push-button start, a seven-inch TFT digital driver’s display, multi-angle rearview camera, and the Honda Sensing package of safety technologies. The latter includes things like Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, Collision Mitigation Braking, Road Departure Mitigation, Lane Departure Warning, and Traffic Sign Recognition.
Power & Performance
The heart of the new Accord Hybrid is a two-motor powertrain system, which pairs a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine (DOHC i-VTEC Atkinson-cycle) with an electric propulsion motor creating 232 lb-ft. of torque. Total system output is 212 horsepower, which Honda says is class-leading. The powertrain operates by shifting between three distinct drive operations: EV Drive (electric motor), Hybrid Drive (electric motor and gasoline engine [driving the generator motor]), and Engine Drive (gasoline engine).
Honda also notes the steering wheel-mounted Deceleration Selectors, which are similar to transmission paddle shifters and help increase efficiency. The Deceleration Selectors allow drivers to toggle between four levels of regenerative braking. The right selector increases regenerative braking and the left selector reduces it. Honda says this minimizes stress on the brakes while increasing battery charge via regeneration.
Interior Room & Cargo Space
The 2018 Accord Hybrid rides on a wheelbase 2.16-inches longer when compared to the outgoing model. The car’s intelligent power unit is 32 percent smaller and mounted under the rear floor versus the trunk. These design changes allow for a 60/40-split rear seat for easier people and cargo hauling. Honda says the figures are class-leading with cargo space at 16.7 cubic feet, interior space at 122.3 cubic feet, and rear legroom at 40.4 inches.
Trim Levels & Pricing
The 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid comes in Hybrid, EX (new), EX-L, EX-L Navi (new), and Touring. Starting MSRP is $25,990 for the entry-level Hybrid and $35,600 for the Touring trim. The starting MSRP actually represents a $4,505 drop compared to the previous Accord Hybrid.

2018/03/19,Nissan Celebrates Production Milestone In Mississippi,"Nissan’s Canton assembly plant has achieved a milestone, recently surpassing 4 million vehicles produced. With an annual capacity of 450,000 vehicles, the plant currently builds the Nissan Altima, Murano, Titan and Titan XD, Frontier, NV Cargo Van, and NV Passenger Van. To commemorate the achievement, Nissan presented the 4 millionth vehicle – a 2018 NV Cargo Van – to Our Daily Bread Ministries, a nonprofit organization that provides hunger relief to the local community.
Second Shift
Nissan also announced the addition of a second shift that promises to create or retain 250 hourly jobs. The second shift will support the increasing demand for Nissan’s commercial vans.
“Adding a second shift for NV Van production underscores our employees’ hard work and dedication to building world class, quality vehicles for our customers,” explained Steve Marsh, Vice President, Manufacturing, Nissan Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant.
Continued Growth
  Nissan has grown the Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant from a regional manufacturing facility to a global one, investing $3.4 billion in the facility since its opening in 2003. Nissan employs 6,400 at the Canton plant currently, with more than 1,500 jobs added since 2013.
“The City of Canton congratulates Nissan on this outstanding achievement,” said Dr. William Truly, Mayor of the City of Canton. “Milestones like these are not easily achieved, and we applaud the hardworking men and women of this facility who build great vehicles for the citizens of Canton and customers around the world.”
Power & Performance
For 2018, the NV Cargo and NV Passenger vans are available with a 5.6-liter Endurance V8 engine and heavy-duty seven-speed automatic transmission. Both models are also offered with a smaller 4.0-liter V6 and five-speed automatic transmission. The engines create 375 and 261 horsepower respectively.

2018/03/19,Range Rover SV Coupe: The Perfect Fit That’s Way Too Over The Top,"Range Rover has just released their latest model, the SV Coupe. Yes, indeed it is a coupe version of their full-size luxury SUV. My first thought was, “why on Earth would anyone make a two-door version of an SUV?” And then of course I realized the all-too-obvious answer: Money. If Range Rover went to all this trouble to make it, they must know there’s enough people out there willing to buy it.
Perfect Fit
In a lot of ways, a Range Rover is the Perfect SUV. Since 99.9% of SUV buyers will never take theirs off-road, and since they are mainly used as a way to convince others of their superiority when compared to all other mobility options, what better vehicle choice than a full-zoot Range Rover? Sure, you could go with that Bentley thing, but isn’t that a little on the ostentatious side, old sport? The new Lamborghini what-zit? Come-come now. That’s an Italian car. No, the Range Rover is it.
Extensive & Personalized
And sure, you do get a lot, even with this demonstrably lame Range Rover SV Coupe. For one thing, it’s a limited-run piece. They are only making about a thousand of them. And, it’s a two-door, indeed the world’s first full-size luxury SUV Coupe. And since it’s a Rangey, and limited in numbers, they thoroughly went over all the appointments one will find within. Range Rover says there are “beautifully curated interiors” that “set new standards for materials and craftsmanship, with extensive personalization options for SV Coupe clients.” Curated. They really used that word.
Interior Treatments
The whole interior design option palette is right out of a Savile Row tailor. SV Coupe buyers (Range Rover refers to them as “clients” obviously since “buyer” is so nouveau riche and low class) can choose from any of four front-to-rear contrast interior selections. Rover (can I just use the single name?) calls them “colorways,” and I have no idea why. If the front-to-rear fade is a little too avant garde for you sir, there is also a range of single-tone interior colors from which to choose.
Of course, whichever you choose, they will be complemented by your choice of three elegant wood veneers, including a first for Range Rover, the Nautica veneer. Nautica veneer seeks to sensitively balance heritage and craftsmanship with new technology by fusing walnut and sycamore together. Obviously, this Nautica stuff might be too much for some buyers. Best to play it safe.
And if the interior is that dolled up, you can rest assured the exterior is just as affected. There are new optional exterior paint finishes named Liquesence (no, really) that join the “suite” (ugh) of available paint options. And yes, the paint names are as equally conceited and senseless: Constellation, Parallax, and Obsidian, along with Ethereal, Flux, Valloire, and Desire.
Power & Performance
On the upside of the balance sheet we find the engine. The SV Coupe is the fastest-ever, full-size Range Rover, so there’s that. This brick on wheels tops out at 165 mph, which is impressive given its shape. That top speed comes by way of a lovingly overpowered V8 plant: 557 horsepower worth of a 5.0-liter supercharged V8 powertrain lies beneath the big flat-ish hood. And that is, in case you’re wondering, the most powerful engine currently offered on the full-size Range Rover.
RELATED
2020 Nissan Titan: Can Nissan Impress Loyal Truck Buyers?
So you can blow your own horn about that tidbit too. This means the SV Coupe can hasten from zero to 60 mph in a scant five seconds. Pretty good for a truck that tips the scales at slightly more than the HMS Ark Royal.
Interesting References
And here’s an odd bit that jumped out at me from the company’s press release: “Noble Chrome metal side vents with Brunel Metallic mesh and Satin Indus Silver metal surrounds complement frameless doors with Power Close functionality and Bright Chrome embellished body color door handles.”
Brunel Metallic mesh? Is that a reference to Isambard Kingdom Brunel? They make no mention as to why they call some of the brightwork that, but it is a nice flourish and it’s probably a reference to one of the most interesting and oddest people England produced in the 19th century. And yeah, I’m including Jack The Ripper in that list.
Pricing & Availability
The SV Coupe will be hand-built at Range Rover’s SVO Technical Center in Warwickshire, UK, their in-house custom department. There will be no more than 999 examples available worldwide and they will start at $295,000 in the United States. $295,000! Cor’ Blimey!!

2018/03/17,2019 Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door Coupe: Don’t Let The Name Fool You,"For those of you that don’t like the idea of four-door “coupes,” you’re either pedantic, or the design bothers you or whatever, but you better get used to seeing them. All signs point to them staying around, at least for the foreseeable future. Take, for example, the latest Mercedes-Benz. Creatively called the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, it shows the German automotive titan will not be slowing down with this form factor anytime soon.
And if Mercedes does it, and makes it work, you can bet that other manufacturers will follow.
Waxing Poetics
For those having a hard time following the concept here, a four-door coupe looks to have the best of both worlds, or, at least, splits the difference between two separate and distinct automotive desigs: the four-door sedan and the two-door coupe. The four-door coupe looks to have the swoopy, sporty proportions of a coupe, merged with the convenience and practicality of a four door. And Mercedes (and others) have gotten the first part of that right. These four-door coupe things do look very nice and much less stuffy than a straight up, three-box sedan.
I just don’t think you should call it a coupe. It’s not. It’s got four doors, so that instantly takes it out of the running for being called a “coupe.”
Benchmarks & Goosebumps
Anyhoo, what does the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe bring to the party? Well, it’s a Mercedes, so it will obviously bring all that traditional Merc stuff to the game. Fantastic build quality, attention to detail, unparalleled safety, engineering, and reliability that are the world’s benchmark. Specifically, the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe is a sort-of-stretched, massaged, “practical” version of the German company’s very impressive AMG GT two-seat sports car. It aims to be that literally, mythical “four-door sports car” people often talk about, and sports car owners such as myself snicker at.
More space, more power, more goosebumps Mercedes-Benz claims, and I am not going to argue with them. The automaker says it’s the first four-door sports car from Affalterbach, but I am going to have to disagree and say the AMG GT 4-Door Coupe is a very nicely styled sports sedan. Think of it like that, forget the coupe moniker, and just move on to what it can do.
Power & Performance
And what it can do is very impressive, being motivated down the Straße by a twin-turbocharged V8 of low displacement but delightfully high power. It’s a little 4.0-liter V8 biturbo plant that cranks out a lovely sounding 630 horsepower and 627 lb-ft. of torque. 60 mph comes up in 3.1 seconds and it will top out at 195 mph. See, both quick and fast!

GM to Make Face Masks for Frontline Workers
It’s the same basic mill found in the Mercedes-AMG GT 63, but it puts out more power and grunt. It also has that now fashionable packaging layout of having both turbos arranged not on the exterior, but between the cylinder banks in the “hot inner V.” It’s more compact and the turbo response is more immediate. It also sounds like a thermal loading nightmare, but hey, did I get a degree in engineering? No. No I did not.
This magnificent lump of power is joined to a nine-speed transmission specially tuned for the four-door AMG GT. It uses a wet clutch, which reduces weight and inertia but optimizes engine response. Mercedes has modified the software for shorter shift times, fast multiple downshifts, and added a slick double-declutching function that sounds rad. There’s even a RACE START function, ensuring this will not be a boring sedan in non-boring clothing.
The new AMG GT 4-Door Coupe is also available as the Mercedes-AMG GT 53 with the company’s 429 horsepower, 3.0-liter Inline-6 turbo engine.
Marketing Speak
Yes, it is pretty to look at, even if there are more compromises there than found in a coupe, let alone a true sports car. Merc says it “opens up the sports car segment to those looking for a vehicle for day-to-day use.” I say that’s deeply heretical marketing codswallop. I also say a vehicle for “day-to-day use” like that already exists. It’s called a sports car. Live with it and love it.
Mercedes has worked long and hard to make the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of the GT 4-Door Coupe be as sports car-like as possible. It’s not just the styling, the low hood, muscular body language and all that. Oh no, it can turn and stop on a pfennig, thanks to the heavily tuned chassis, enormous brake discs, and six-pot calipers.
Interior Treatments
And the interior is far from race car Spartan. The controls can be intuitively operated and configured as the driver sees fit. Mercedes blends individualization with sports car tech, focusing on the requirements of discerning customers that love a good, spirited drive. Mercedes describes the interior as “elegant coolness,” complete with all the ultra-modern features they could throw at it.
Pricing & Availability
No price info yet but given how reasonably priced the GT sports car is (for the amount of performance it gives you) I bet the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door Coupe will be okay cost-wise. Expect to seem them on the market early to mid 2019.

2018/03/15,General Motors Invests $100 Million Toward Autonomous Vehicle Production,"General Motors has announced a $100 million investment to upgrade two manufacturing facilities in Michigan, a move that strengthens the company’s ongoing commitment to automated driving. The announcement comes on the heels of Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra’s presentation during the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Texas on March 7th.
“With human error still the leading cause of crashes, ultimately self-driving cars can help save many of the 1.25 million people around the world who are killed in crashes every year,” she said during the event.
Coming Soon
Production-versions of the Cruise AV (autonomous vehicle) are scheduled for assembly at GM’s Orion Township facility, with the roof modules for the self-driving vehicles coming from the Brownstown Battery Assembly Plant, about an hour from Lake Orion. GM notes the investment will help upgrade both facilities accordingly.
The Cruise AV is the first production-ready vehicle built from the ground up, according to GM. The automaker says it can operate safely on its own with no driver, steering wheel, pedals, or manual controls. Earlier this year, GM’s Self-Driving Safety Report detailed how the Cruise AV will accomplish this through things like advanced LiDAR and Comprehensive Risk Management.
“We’re continuing to make great progress on our plans to commercialize in 2019,” said Dan Ammann, President, General Motors. “Our Orion and Brownstown teams have proven experience in building high-quality self-driving test vehicles and battery packs, so they are well-prepared to produce the Cruise AV.”
“The UAW is committed to preparing our members for the future of advanced mobility and this investment recognizes our willingness to work together to build these self-driving vehicles,” added Cindy Estrada, Vice President and Director, UAW General Motors Department.
Committed Workforce
Since January 2017, UAW Local 5960 workers at the Orion plant have assembled three generations of Cruise self-driving test vehicles for use in the most challenging urban environments, including downtown San Francisco. More than 200 test vehicles have already been assembled at Orion. The Orion plant will continue to build the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Sonic in addition to the Cruise AV.
“Whether it involves traditional vehicles or advance technology, our members are highly capable of delivering great products,” Estrada said.

2018/03/15,Audi Vehicles Can Now “Talk” With Traffic Lights In Washington DC,"More than 600 intersections in the District of Columbia now support Audi’s “time-to-green” feature of Traffic Light Information. The system falls under the category of “vehicle-to-infrastructure” technology, sometimes abbreviated as V2I. Traffic Light Information, an Audi connect PRIME feature available on certain late models, enables the vehicle to communicate with the infrastructure in metropolitan areas across the United States.
Expanding Network
Audi, in collaboration with Traffic Technology Services, has already expanded the feature in the Dallas and Houston metros, along with Palo Alto and Arcadia, California, Portland, Oregon, and Denver, Colorado. With the addition of Washington D.C., more than 1,600 intersections across the United States now support Traffic Light Information.
“This initiative represents the kind of innovation that is critical for us to advance the traffic safety goals of Vision Zero,” said District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. “We look forward to building on this, and similar partnerships, as we continue to build a safer, stronger, and smarter D.C.”
How It Works
Vehicles equipped with the technology will receive real-time signals from connected traffic lights via the on-board 4G LTE data connection. When the light is red, the time remaining until the signal changes is displayed in the instrument cluster or heads-up display. The automaker says future iterations of this and other V2I technologies will be used to further enhance mobility and reduce congestion.
“Audi continues to be an industry leader in connectivity and mobility solutions,” explained Scott Keogh, President, Audi of America. “Not only do V2I technologies like Traffic Light Information help to reduce driver stress, they are also essential infrastructure developments as we continue toward an automated future.”
Traffic Light Information was launched in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2016.

2018/03/14,"Bugatti Chiron Sport: Yeah, So What","Hey look, there’s a new Bugatti here, the Bugatti Chiron Sport. I’m sure a lot of people will be excited by this news. I, however, am not one of them. There’s a new Bugatti Chiron Sport? So what.
Yes, yes, I know. The Bugatti Chiron Sport, like the “normal” Chiron or even the Veyron before it, is a technical marvel. There’s about as much technological sorcery and power packed into these things as an ICBM. The engine is a purposefully weird layout with enough forced induction blowers, coolers, intercoolers, and radiators to seem like something from an WWII fighter.
And all that power is put to the ground through a very sophisticated all-wheel drive system and tires the size of oil drums.
Talking Track
But again: So what? Bugattis are all wonderful, technical exercises, but why does that really matter? Would I be as impressed if someone built a steam car as fast as a Ferrari? Sure, but I wouldn’t care all that much. You built a prop plane that can break the sound barrier? Cool . . . but, so what? Who’s going to buy the thing? None of the world’s air forces, I can tell you that. So Bugatti does all this cool stuff and gets monstrous levels of performance. But they don’t race. And if you don’t race, it doesn’t count. Period.
Bugatti, the old man himself, even for all his affectations of a third rate maitre d’ from Leon, and being picky for pickiness sake, at least he Raced. These new guys, Volkswagen, essentially, they bought the Bugatti name and slapped it onto an Audi/VW/Porsche-drawing board and made a very good road car. But for me and my money, if you don’t race it, you don’t count.
Handling & Torque Tech
Curiously, what differentiates the Bugatti Chiron Sport from the normal Chiron is weight. The Chiron Sport is supposed to be all about handling performance, but you don’t have to look very deep to see it’s mainly a trim package with some new wheels and a few bits and bobs here and there. You think this thing is going to handle? At more than two tons, 4,400 pounds actually, I’d bet any one of the new Lotus special editions would chew this thing up and spit out the pieces on a tight mountain road.
The new Chiron Sport, which has the same power output and performance data as the other Chirons, does come with a dynamic handling package, a stiffer suspension, and the new Dynamic Torque Vectoring function. Nice. Torque vectoring is important, and it really transformed the first road car its inventor, Ferrari, put it on more than a decade ago. Thanks for joining the party.
RELATED

Grocery Getter
The Chiron Sport also gets a new wheel design and four-pipe exhaust deflector. And by deflector, I’m guessing they mean diffusor. Which means Bugatti focused on blowing the underbody, and sticking the thing down on high-speed corners. And that’s all well and good, but it’s also a gimme. Of course they’re going to maximize high-speed grip. All they got is speed. Trying to get more handling at lower speeds would reap little rewards for a Holstein of a car.
Which explains this little tidbit from Bugatti: “Chiron Sport corners significantly faster: lap times on Nardò handling circuit five seconds better than with Chiron.” Have you seen a map of the Nardò handling circuit? I count one long straight, two high-speed wiggly bits, and more than a few very high-speed sweepers. Put this thing on a course where you need Handling and not just “handling,” and you’ll get what I’m on about.
To further understand this, clock to this: The weight has been reduced 18 kilograms, or around 36 lbs. That’s it. After all this, it’s dropped the weight of a bag full of groceries. If you dropped that much weight from oh, a Miata, you’d notice it, but on this tank, shedding less than one percent of the all up weight ain’t going to get you bupkis. Oh, and before I forget, the Chiron Sport is the first production vehicle in the automotive industry with carbon fiber windscreen wipers. Really. Talk about gilding the lily.
Pricing & Availability
The base price of the new Bugatti Chiron Sport is €2.65 million net, or $3.26 million for the U.S. market, including transport, customs duties, taxes, and fees. And for that amount of yenom, the filthy rich customers can choose individual color and trim options to “give their car an even sportier appearance.” Larf. For that amount of money, I could choose several cars that would be more fun up a mountainside and back, and none of them would take the automotive equivalent of a papal bull to get serviced.
First deliveries are planned for the end of the year. I’d say get in line, but you already are if this is your sort of car. It’s obviously not to my tastes.

2018/03/14,Lamborghini Huracán Performante Spyder: Open-Air Emotion,"Lamborghini just rolled out the latest version of its Huracán, the Huracán Performante Spyder. That’s just a very continental way of saying: Hey look, we made the Huracán into a Targa-esque thing. No, it’s not really a convertible. And no, it’s not really a Spyder either, but it will blow your hair back to the tune of a 202 mph blast of wind.
The Huracán Performante is the more, uh, performance-oriented version of the “regular” Huracán (not that there’s much “regular” about this little beastie to begin with). Although I’ve seen no official word, it seems “Performante” will be to Lambos what Speciale is to Ferraris: the factory hot rod version.
Aerodynamic Design
From a design standpoint, the Performante Spyder takes a number of cues from Super Trofeo race cars, and also from open-frame street fighter motorcycles. Okay, kind of childish, but that’s kind of what Lamborghini is known for. There’s visible carbon fiber running throughout and the aluminum bits here and there drop 35 kilos (around 75 lbs.) versus the original Huracán Spyder. The use of forged composites are found in the front and rear spoiler, engine bonnet, rear bumper, and aerodynamic diffuser.
All of those are functional aero elements within Lamborghini’s patented active aerodynamics system, first introduced on the Huracán Performante: Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva, or ALA. The ALA system varies aero-load for either high down force or low drag, as well as enabling aero vectoring in high-speed cornering, thus providing excellent dynamics on the road or track. And all of this ALA stuff is governed by the Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale (LPI) system in real time; tweaking the car’s setup as well as activating the ALA system in less than 500 milliseconds to ensure the best aerodynamic configuration in every driving condition.
Power & Performance
With its 5.2, V10 naturally-aspirated engine, the Performante Spyder accelerates to 62 mph in 3.1 seconds and to 124 mph in 9.3 seconds. Like the Performante coupé, the Spyder outputs 640 horsepower at 8,000 rpm, producing 442 lb-ft. of torque at 6,500 rpm. Lamborghini says more than 70 percent of that torque is readily available at 1,000 rpm.
The Spyder, like the Huracán Performante coupé, includes an enhanced suspension system, recalibrated ESC, a more responsive Lamborghini Dynamic Steering system, and a permanent four-wheel drive layout for maximizing traction. Lamborghini’s driver-mode system comprising of STRADA, SPORT, and CORSA allows you to customize the car to suit your tastes.
Open-Air Enjoyment
The roof part of the Huracán Performante Spyder is a lightweight, electro-hydraulic deal that complements the car’s distinctive lines, whether open or closed. It is also said to maintain rigidity and handling, since even as a convertible it maintains the stiffness of a sports car. The roof opens in just 17 seconds up to a speed of 30 mph, which is a totally cool move to pull when leaving your burger joint of choice.

2018/03/14,The Range Rover Sport SVR Just Topped A Ferrari,"An SUV has not only matched but outperformed a supercar on a notable road in China. The new Range Rover Sport SVR has taken the record for negotiating the 99 corners of the famous Tianmen Road. A standard production Range Rover Sport SVR set a new unofficial record of 9 minutes 51 seconds for the seven mile ascent, at an average speed of 42.8mph, beating the previous record of 10 minutes 31 seconds, set by a Ferrari 458 Italia in 2016.
Tackling Tianmen Road is the latest challenge completed by the Range Rover Sport PHEV, following a climb to the Heaven’s Gate natural rock arch last month. The PHEV made its debut in a race against two-time open-water swimming world champion Keri-anne Payne and endurance athlete Ross Edgley in Devon, UK.
The new Range Rover Sport SVR is the fastest Land Rover to date with its 567 horsepower supercharged V8. The SUV hits 60 in 4.3 seconds and can achieve a top speed of 174 mph. It’s considered a flagship for the brand with design revisions and lightweight materials to enhance performance, handling, and agility. Engineers focused on controlling pitch under heavy acceleration and braking, and changes to the damping hardware have improved turn-in, mid-corner grip, and body control.
It must have worked, at least according to Panasonic Jaguar Racing driver Ho-Pin Tung, who again piloted the Range Rover Sport SVR for the record-breaking feat.
“I am used to the high speeds of racing but these 99 turns were something unique. Maintaining concentration was the biggest challenge as the road twists and turns constantly, with huge drop-offs to the side,” he explained. “The consequences of getting it wrong would have been really serious so I focused on establishing a rhythm and the Range Rover Sport SVR made this easy – it may be an SUV but it has the performance and agility of a supercar and can take you to places a supercar can only dream of.”

2018/03/13,This Special McLaren 720S Is A Blue Beauty,"Like many other high-end car manufacturers, McLaren has their own in-house custom shop. It’s called McLaren Special Operations, or MSO, and it is responsible for creating customized versions of the British company’s already impressive cars. Bespoke, to use the veddy, veddy British term.
Deep Blue Somthing
The McLaren 720S in Atlantic Blue by MSO takes the deepest of deep blue paint the Woking outfit could come up with, and combines it with a classic Saddle Tan leather interior. I’ve got to say the result is very easy on the eyes. McLaren says the Atlantic Blue really shows off the “shrink-wrapped” design of the 720S, a car noted for its aerodynamics, smoothly sculpted surfaces, and double-hinged dihedral doors.
The McLaren 720S in Atlantic Blue was commissioned for the Geneva International Motor Show as a showcase for MSO’s bespoke craftsmanship and range of personalization choices. MSO’s capabilities include developing special materials, finishes, colors, and trim pieces, providing specific aerodynamic and lightweight components, and crafting entire one-off cars.
Driver-Focused
This particular Atlantic Blue McLaren 720S is the second in the company’s Super Series that marries supercar performance with a glut of luxury and convenience features in the glass-enclosed, teardrop-shaped cockpit. The McLaren 720S focuses entirely on the driving experience thanks to its use of aerodynamics, proactive suspension control, carbon-fiber construction, and a very potent 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8.
Thanks to that plant, the McLaren 720S puts out 720PS (as its name implies, but that translates to 710 bhp in American measurements) and can deliver a top speed of 212 mph. 62 mph comes up in a quick 2.9 seconds. And this is no performance stripper either. Heated electric seats, keyless entry, soft-close doors, cruise control, electrically-adjustable steering column, and a climate control system are all standard features.
Further Modifications
Since MSO rightly thinks the typical owner will want their ride to be suitable for both track driving and everyday usability, the Atlantic Blue McLaren 720S comes with the McLaren Track Telemetry and camera system. This is for enjoyment on the track naturally, but it’s practical with its 360-degree Park Assist system. The sensors and cameras will help you out in crowded city driving environments. The car also comes with a vehicle lift to avoid damage over ramps, speed bumps, steep(ish) driveways, and the like. There is a Bowers & Wilkins 12-speaker audio system in there too.
Pricing
How much, you ask? Well, customized, er bespoke stuff don’t come cheap, chaps, and in the case of this McLaren 720S in Atlantic Blue, that means £281,260, or right around $400,000 green back dollars.

2018/03/12,Infiniti Engineering Academy Seeking Student Applicants,"You know that Infiniti Engineering Academy deal? Well Infiniti is doing it again, and this time around they are partnering with the Renault Sport Formula One Team. This means trackside finals at F1 Grand Prix races with the Renault F1 team. It’s obviously an amazing opportunity for students looking to tackle a career in engineering.
Infiniti has just announced the 2018 edition of its successful Infiniti Engineering Academy. This marks the fifth consecutive year they are looking to recruit the best engineers from across the globe to work with both the high-end Japanese auto manufacturer and, a new twist this time around, also work with the Renault Sport Formula One Team.
Rare Opportunities
Infiniti calls this a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” and I, for one, am not going to argue with them. The program is intended to enlist decidedly driven students looking to make it in the “vehicle engineering industry.” In other words, if a given student has the skills to make it in something besides road cars, Infiniti is not going to stop them. And this is the cool part: these students will get to rub shoulders with some of the most experienced engineers at the Renault Formula 1 team.
The finalists, 10 per participating region, will be given full access to the pit lane, garage, and motorhome areas of the Renault Sport Formula One Team starting on the Thursday before their local Grand Prix. While there, they will carry out several challenges under the watchful eyes of Bob Bell, Chief Technical Officer of the Renault Formula One team, drivers Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz, and other team members. By the way, everyone says that Bell is a softy deep down inside, but you didn’t hear that one from me kids. Good luck if you get on his bad side.
Ivy Leagues
But wait, things look even more intense for the 2018 version of the Infiniti Engineering Academy. For this year’s go-round, Infiniti has partnered with Harvard University Professor Dr. Julia Minson. Dr. Minson specializes in decision science and will work with the Infiniti Engineering Academy to conduct research into engineering decision making, and how engineers perform under pressure making choices when faced with vast amounts of complex data. The statistics gathered by Dr. Minson will be incorporated by both the Infiniti engineering and Motorsport teams to optimize their decision making processes in the future.
Selection Process
Dr. Minson and her team will also help during the recruitment process and will assist the judges during the finals to confirm that the best winners are selected. Infiniti and Dr. Minson will have a big job ahead of them for 2018. Applications are up this year, and last year, 2017, attracted over 12,000 registrations from 41 different countries. That was nearly three times more than before. Remember, there will only be seven places available globally, so to call the competition “fierce” would be a bit of an understatement.

2018/03/12,Lexus Debuts “Urban Explorer” In Geneva,"Lexus has just shown its first-ever compact luxury crossover, the UX, at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show. The UX, according to Lexus, aims to introduce a bold new design, efficient powertrains, and innovative luxury features all in a smaller, more compact package. And it seems like Lexus is on a roll, as the unveiling of the UX comes after the recent launch of the new LC flagship coupe, LS flagship sedan, and the re-done RX “luxury utility vehicle.”
New Architecture
The UX is the first ride in the Lexus lineup to use the brand’s new “GA-C (Global Architecture – Compact) platform.” Lexus calls it a “super-rigid structure” with a low center of gravity to enhance handling, agility, and ride comfort, along with giving the vehicle a “distinctive driving personality.” No, I’m not sure what they mean exactly, but marketing speak, y’know.
Lexus also says the wheels feature a world-first aerodynamic design. Computer simulations and wind tunnel testing yielded a profile shape for the spokes that increases the airflow to cool the disc brakes, without compromising the vehicle’s coefficient of drag.
Engine & Transmission
The 2019 Lexus UX will come in two versions. The first, the UX 200, introduces a new 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine mated to a new Direct-Shift CVT (continuously variable transmission), an interesting move. The UX 250h pairs that same 2.0-liter gas mill with the brand’s fourth-generation hybrid drive system. Lexus has gone so far as to link the hybrid drive system with a new tech network and the in-car navigation to allow the UX 250h to proactively optimize hybrid operation by learning and adapting to the owner’s routes and driving habits. Is it just me, or does that sound kind of creepy?
But all that, and all the other connectivity features this and USB interface that, are rather beside the point. Look, you and I both know that stem to stern, top to bottom, this thing is going to be kitted out with tech and communication features just this side of the Starship Enterprise. What this is really about is size and packaging.
Design Language
The design, which is notable for its crisp, prominent sculpting and dramatically flared front and rear fenders, still looks like an SUV, but more compact. The whole design seeks to envelope the cabin and provide a driver-focused cockpit and a roomy, relaxing space for passengers. The vehicle’s smaller proportions (103.9-inch wheelbase) allow for easy maneuverability, with a tiny, best-in-segment, according to Lexus, 34-foot turning circle. The 177-inch length lets the Lexus UX easily slip into “compact only” parking spaces.
RELATED
2020 Dodge Charger GT AWD: Dashing Through The Snow
Oh, and by the by, UX stands for Urban Explorer, which is cheesy.
Styling Cues
Sadly, the Urban Explorer has that same hideous Lexus spindle grille up front, but this time around it has a new, block-shape mesh pattern with individual elements that gradually change in shape as they radiate out from the central Lexus emblem. Yawn. Daytime running lights are arranged in an arrowhead pattern above the headlights and out back, the rear goes for an elegant yet simple treatment, contrasting with the flared fenders. The UX also sports the company’s latest design feature: full-width taillights formed by 120 LEDs tapering toward the center.
Pricing & Availability
So yeah, the bottom line is this: It’s the new Lexus SUV/crossover that will (most likely) work exceedingly well in mall parking lots as well as in your nearest downtown. The UX 200 and UX 250h will go into production this fall and go on sale in December. No word on pricing yet, but it will be announced closer to that time.

2018/03/10,New Dodge Challenger Package Reminds Us Why Muscle Cars Rule,"Ask Dodge any question today and the answer is horsepower. Is it necessary to have a family hauler approaching 500 horsepower in any automaker’s product lineup, or in your driveway for that matter? Nope. But yes. Yes it is. Ask any Mopar fan and they will likely agree. And Mopar enthusiasts can fall in love with their beloved Challenger all over again as Dodge has just released the new Shakedown Package.
Loud & Proud
Dodge is a refreshing reminder of what cars used to be – and still can be. They are the only automaker carrying on the muscle car mantra, proudly holding the torch of an era we long thought had passed. They make big engines. And they make big cars. It’s a beautiful thing. So much in the automotive business today is focused on infotainment or connectivity or better efficiency. Or it’s focused on autonomous driving, which we’re led to believe is the answer to all our ills. I’m not saying these things are unimportant – they are – but every once in awhile, it’s nice to see a car with attitude that won’t take you know what from anybody.
The cars that do this best are the Dodge Challenger and Charger. Detroit Muscle with a capital D and M.
Shakedown Package
To amplify that attitude further, the Challenger R/T Shaker, R/T Plus Shaker, and 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker now have the option for the Shakedown Package. Uniting old-school muscle and modern styling, the Shakedown Package adds unique asymmetrical black racing stripes that flow up and over the rear decklid and roof, then around the Shaker hood scoop. The package was inspired by the 1971 Dodge Shakedown Challenger that debuted at the 2016 SEMA show.
“Dodge/SRT has a rich history of using iconic heritage and high-impact colors and unique graphics to make our vehicles look custom, straight from the factory,” explained Steve Beahm, Head of Passenger Car Brands, Dodge/SRT, Chrysler and Fiat – FCA North America.
The upgraded Alpine audio system is a really sweet addition to the Shakedown Package, and nobody has to tell us twice to crank the volume. The R/T Shaker receives six premium speakers and a 275-watt amplifier, while the R/T Shaker Plus and 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker receive nine – count ’em nine – premium speakers and a 506-watt amplifier.
The best part is the price. The Shakedown Package is available for all exterior colors for an MSRP of $995. Not unreasonable at all.
Colorful Creations
Also new for 2018 are the iconic B5 Blue and Plum Crazy paint colors for both Challenger and Charger. Dodge says initially Challenger T/A, T/A Plus, and the T/A 392 will get first dibs, but other Challenger models will have the colors as options later on.

2020 Genesis G90: It’s a Whole Lot of Car
In the late 60s and early 70s, B5 Blue and Plum Crazy were the hottest colors for these cars, and it brings up a warm sense of nostalgia to see them return. These are the ideal car show colors having rolled out of the factory almost 50 years ago. Known as High Impact Paint, the roster included such hues as Panther Pink, Hemi Orange, Top Banana, Sassy Grass, Go Mango, and of course, B5 Blue and Plum Crazy. What a time indeed.
Answering The Call
Dodge says the Shakedown Package and legacy colors are about answering the call of today’s muscle car and performance enthusiast. It’s about that “Mopar-or-no-car” mindset, and it’s honestly just really refreshing to see.
“Whether a customer remembers B5 and Plum Crazy from when they were new in the ‘60s and ‘70s or they’re a new customer today, these paint colors and unique Shaker stripes stand out in the crowd and speak to our customers’ passion for their cars and their love of the Dodge and SRT brands,” Beahm said.

2018/03/09,Le Fil Rouge Concept: The Future Hyundai?,"Hyundai recently unveiled the Le Fil Rouge (HDC-1) concept at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show. As the name implies, Le Fil Rouge (common thread) is Hyundai’s belief that past, present, and future designs are interconnected.
“Le Fil Rouge is a reinterpretation of Hyundai’s design DNA that originated from the brand’s historical Hyundai Coupe Concept in 1974,” explained Luc Donckerwolke, Executive Vice President and Head of Hyundai’s Design Center.
Four Points
Is this a new era for Hyundai and a preview of what their next cars will look like? It appears so. Hyundai calls this new design “Sensuous Sportiness,” which centers on four different but distinct traits: proportion, architecture, styling, and technology. Here is a brief look at what these four individual elements mean.
“Building on our long history of creating distinctive and sporty character in vehicles, we will open a new era for Hyundai design,” Donckerwolke said.
Proportion & Architecture
Proportion will be achieved through things like a longer wheel base, larger wheels, and shorter overhangs. The proportion aspect also involves how the driver will sit in the car and how the roofline impacts the vehicle’s appearance. In a similar way, the architecture component – or “Light Architecture” as Hyundai dubs it – will create a forward-motion look and feel.
“Tube Architecture” is the expansion of Light Architecture, only on the inside. The idea, according to Hyundai, is to create an emotional response inside the vehicle that matches the exterior. Tube Architecture also accounts for the interior’s overall ergonomics while prioritizing a lightweight design to increase performance.
Styling & Technology
Although styling seems to be the biggest element, what Hyundai really wants is for their cars to be recognized from a distance; and this new design language incorporates the artistic elements necessary to make that happen. The technology part seems self explanatory, but with regard to where Hyundai wants to go, it shows up in little, unexpected ways.
“Our goal is to build a beloved brand by creating vehicles with heightened emotional value to reshape the landscape of car design,” said Sang-yup Lee, Vice President and Head of Hyundai Styling.”
Tech for Hyundai means more than just intuitive controls and panoramic floating displays, but also re-vitalized wood and special fabrics that create emotion when a driver sits down. The Sensuous Sportiness theme will expand to all Hyundai vehicles, from sedans to SUVs. The ultimate goal is to bring new levels of beauty, charisma, and desirability to the product lineup.
“This is the foundation of our concept,” Lee added.
In Person
The Hyundai Le Fil Rouge concept is on display at the Geneva International Motor Show until the 18th.

2018/03/09,McLaren ‘Hyper-GT’: Fastest McLaren Ever Fires The Cannon,"You know when you’re in a bar on the wrong side of town, then all of a sudden there’s the sound of breaking glass and roaring silence and a deep, harsh voice says, “Okay then. Let’s take it outside.” Well that is, in essence, what McLaren just said to every other car maker on the planet, but they were looking right at Bugatti when they said it.
Hyper Tension
McLaren just fired this huge warning shot at the Geneva International Motor Show. They call it the ‘Hyper-GT,’ which is a stupid, stupid name, but it’s only a place holder, so don’t worry. The main thing they said was the ‘Hyper-GT’ will be capable of exceeding 243 mph. Yes, for those of you keeping track at home, that’s the max velocity of the iconic McLaren F1. Yes, in a way, this will be the “replacement” for the F1. In a way. And also “exceeding 243 mph” means it is going to be pretty close to what Bugattis and Koenigseggs are capable of doing. In other words, the top speed wars are on.
The ‘Hyper-GT’ is the next model in the Ultimate Series and follows the aerodynamically pure, yet aesthetically revolting McLaren Senna. The ‘Hyper-GT’ will feature a three-seat cockpit design and centrally-mounted driving position just like in the F1 (or the Ferrari Guida Centrale, if you want to go way back).
All In One
Baring the internal code name BP23, the ‘Hyper-GT’ aims to be both the fastest-ever and the most luxurious McLaren yet. The idea is that the McLaren BP23 would deliver an unparalleled blend of extreme performance with its petrol-electric hybrid powertrain and sporting luxury, and, at the end of the day, still be the ultimate road-going McLaren. And no, this is not just a rumor, this is straight from the lips of McLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt during the Geneva Motor Show press conference. So consider it as official as it can get.
Limited Commodity
McLaren will only make 106 examples of the BP23. Astute readers will note that 106 is the same number of F1s made by McLaren, so they are really leveraging their past history with this upcoming car of theirs. McLaren also notes that all the ‘Hyper-GTs’ are already sold and will run £1.6 million plus taxes to buy. Kind of cryptic, that. Basically means they cost a lot but they’ve already sold anyway.
Production & In Person
Production is due to begin at the end of 2019, with every BP23 out of the factory personalized to each owner’s taste by McLaren Special Operations, or MSO, the in-house skunk works division responsible for bespoke customer commissions. The real name of the McLaren ‘Hyper-GT’, together with the maximum speed attainable, will be disclosed nearer to the car’s reveal. The ‘Hyper-GT’ will be shown to the public before the end of the year, with a private preview for its depositors ahead of that. That’s a nice way of saying the filthy rich will get a look at it before us yobs do.

2018/03/09,Hey Elon: Say Hello To The Porsche Mission E Cross Turismo,"When it comes to EVs, Teslas are the top-of-the-line, right? They’re the benchmark, or so goes the conventional wisdom. And that also goes a long way to explain that smile often seen on Elon Musk’s face. Well, the new Porsche Mission E Cross Turismo is here to dim that smile a little, if not wipe it off completely.
For a while now, Porsche has been talking trash at Tesla, implying, if not outright stating that Tesla doesn’t understand performance and how to combine it with efficiency. They seem to suggest Teslas are little more than toys and not real cars. ‘Just wait until you see a Porsche EV. You’ll see how off you really are.’
And now, at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show, here it is: the new Porsche Mission E Cross Turismo.
X Marks The Spot
Porsche calls it an electrically-powered “Cross-Utility Vehicle” and it effectively squares off against the Tesla Model X, and by extension, any other crossover out there. The Mission E Cross Turismo is designed for active lifestyle individuals with an all-wheel drive system that easily handles varied weather conditions. The interior offers plenty of cargo space and an exterior mounting system for larger stuff like surfboards or bicycles. The four-seater features a new display and control concept with touchscreens and eye tracking.
It uses an 800-volt fast-charging system and can also be charged via induction or a charging dock, and integrates with a Porsche home energy management system.
Exterior Design
Yes, Porsche calls it a Cross-Utility Vehicle, but it looks sort of like a big station wagon with a slight lift kit. It has the Matrix Design LED headlights found on other Porsches, and even the four-point daytime running lights seen on their race cars. The off-road design elements are seen in the rugged wheel arches and door sills, the front spoiler and rear fascia, and the improved ground clearance. The side skirts go for an off-road look and the 20-inch wheels with big 275/40 R20 tires also help.
There’s a flow-through roof spoiler with a full-length light strip and the large panoramic glass roof extends from the windshield to the tailgate.
Interior Treatments
The interior features a fresh take on the classic Porsche design elements. The instrument panel emphasizes the width of the Mission E Cross. The dashboard has a clear horizontal arrangement with a wide display for both the driver and front passenger. The instrument cluster is curved and angled toward the driver, and is free-standing with three circular display fields shown on TFT screens.

Other interior design elements include visible lightweight structures in the dashboard and seats reminiscent of racing buckets with illuminated Porsche lettering. Anodized trim pieces in Nordic Blue around the air vents and the window switches provide a nice contrast to the black Aniline and Light Grey two-tone interior.
Power & Performance
Now, about that powertrain. There are two synchronous electric motors with a total system output of over 600 horsepower (440 kW). That’s good enough to accelerate the Mission E Cross Turismo to 62 mph in less than 3.5 seconds and to 124 mph in under 12 seconds. The all-wheel drive system with torque vectoring is demand-controlled and automatically distributes torque to the individual wheels.
“This performance is in addition to a continuous power level that allows for multiple launches in succession without losing performance, which is unprecedented among electric vehicles,” reads a statement from Porsche. Although they might as well have added, “Try doing that with your one-shot ‘ludicrous mode’ Elon!” Ouch.
Availability & In Person
Curiously, Porsche does not mention the weight, or the battery design and placement. I’d like to know more about that. Below is a handy chart with the specs we do know. For the time being, it’s on display at the Geneva International Motor Show until the 18th. The production-version Mission E Cross Turismo will make its world premiere next year.

2018/03/08,2019 Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van: One Size Fits Most,"The new Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van just hit the public eye at The Work Truck Show in Indianapolis. It comes with new driver-assist technologies, two new drivetrains, and aims to keep up the Transit Connect’s reputation as being the best-selling compact cargo van in America.
Safety & Convenience Technology
The 2019 Transit Connect is covered with driver-assist technologies – it actually has the most in the segment, according to Ford. There’s Automatic Emergency Braking, Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection, Side Wind Stabilization, and a Rearview Camera all standard. The optional safety features are just as impressive: Blind Spot Information System with Cross-Traffic Alert, Lane Keeping System, and Adaptive Cruise Control.
And, since everybody today is connected and has a smartphone, there’s a standard embedded 4G LTE modem that provides Wi-Fi for up to 10 devices, and an available 6.5-inch floating touchscreen running SYNC 3 to help you while taking customer calls or navigating hands-free to job sites.
Management Tools
FordPass is on board to help monitor small fleets, including such data points as driver location, fuel level, and tire pressure. The MyKey programmable ignition is standard on Transit Connect XLT, so owners and fleet administrators can preset warnings and limits for vehicle speed, but also restrict the entertainment system’s audio to 45 percent of the maximum volume.
Power & Performance
Ford likes to say that there are powertrains to fit every need when it comes to the 2019 Transit Connect Cargo Van. In fact, there are three different engines capable of running on five different types of fuels, so businesses have many choices when it comes to finding the right engine.
There’s a standard and new 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder gasoline engine with Auto Start-Stop and direct-injection. This plant is paired with a new eight-speed automatic for responsive around-town performance and low-rpm cruising on the highway. The 2.0-liter inline four is also E85 compatible and comes with a standard heavy-duty battery, and an available heavy-duty alternator if your job requires it.
There is also a new 1.5-liter EcoBlue diesel engine sporting an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of at least 30 mpg on the highway. This new diesel engine combines the latest in Ford’s fuel injection, turbocharging, and emission control tech, and is fitted with the eight-speed automatic transmission. If you’re a heavy fleet user, there is also a 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder with a six-speed automatic and CNG/propane package available.
Cargo Capacity
But what about your stuff? This is a van after all, so it better be functional and capable when it comes to handling loads. Ford says the Transit Connect is a modern-day workhorse, and I am not about to doubt them. Although Ford did not provide us with exact capacity specs, they do say you can load a 48-inch pallet via forklift with ease thanks to the 180-degree, swing-out rear doors. And the doors can be locked in the open position, which is great news if you have to load and unload on a hill, for instance.
RELATED

With a 38.3-foot turning diameter and shorter wheelbase, the 2019 Transit Connect should be able to handle tight city streets with ease. The Transit Connect will also tow 2,000 lbs. when you get the available tow package, so that’s handy too. Finally, there are dual sliding side doors (ideal for tight urban environments) and near-vertical walls inside with integrated tie-downs.
Add-Ons & Modifications
And since this is a work van aimed at the fleet market, the Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van is as customizable as they come. There is already substantial support from aftermarket upfitters and suppliers for interior cargo management solutions as well as adding stuff like ladders and roof racks. Ford says it doesn’t matter what your business is, from mobile dog grooming to pipefitting, the Transit Connect Cargo Van can be kitted out to meet your needs with ease.
Availability
So what you’ll end up with is a smaller van that delivers great competence and a compact footprint with city-friendly maneuverability. The new Transit Connect is great for small businesses and fleet administrators trying to “right-size” their vehicles. The 2019 Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van goes on sale this fall at more than 3,000 Ford dealers nationwide, including more than 650 dedicated Commercial Vehicle Center dealers.

2018/03/08,Mazda & Toyota Establish Joint-Manufacturing Venture,"Mazda Motor Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation have established a new joint-venture called Mazda Toyota Manufacturing, U.S.A., Inc., or “MTMUS.” The new company will produce vehicles in Huntsville, Alabama starting in 2021 with the goal of increasing production for both automakers. More specifically, the new plant will have the capacity to produce 150,000 units of a forthcoming Mazda crossover and 150,000 units of the Toyota Corolla.
The facility is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs.
“We hope to make MTMUS a plant that will hold a special place in the heart of the local community for many, many years,” explained Masashi Aihara, Mazda’s Executive Officer who will serve as President of MTMUS. “By combining the best of our technologies and corporate cultures, Mazda and Toyota will not only produce high-quality cars but also create a plant employees will be proud to work at and contribute to the further development of the local economy and the automotive industry.”
Toyota and Mazda are investing $1.6 billion toward the venture with equal funding contributions. In collaboration with the state of Alabama and the city of Huntsville, MTMUS will soon begin land preparation for the new plant, with full-scale construction slated to begin next year.
“The new plant, which will be Toyota’s 11th manufacturing facility in the U.S., not only represents our continuous commitment in this country, but also is a key factor in improving our competitiveness of manufacturing in the U.S.,” said Hironori Kagohashi, Executive General Manager of Toyota and MTMUS’s Executive Vice President. “We are committed to realizing a highly competitive plant and producing vehicles with the best quality for customers by combining Toyota and Mazda’s manufacturing expertise and leveraging the joint venture’s synergies. Based on this competitiveness, we will make every effort to becoming a best-in-town plant that will be loved by our hometown.”
“We hope that cars made at the new plant will enrich the lives of their owners and become much more than just a means of transportation,” Aihara added.

2018/03/08,Pirelli Showcases “Cyber Car” In Geneva,"Pirelli unveiled something interesting at the 88th Geneva International Motor Show. This is a product with a pretty irritating name that is actually on the verge of being totally cool. The “Cyber Car” and what it does, and is potentially capable of doing, could be monumental in terms of applied data analytics. Essentially what Cyber Car does is apply big data to your tires, thereby allowing you to use that data to optimize performance.
“Hang on a sec,” you ask, “don’t we do this already?”
Data Linguistics
Why yes, car manufacturers do this already, using sensors placed throughout the vehicle and all the internal computers – throttle position sensors, slip angles, amounts of slip in the electronically-controlled diff, wheel spin indicators – to get a holistic picture of what you are asking the car versus what the car is actually doing moment to moment, and then, doing its best to make the driver’s wish come true.
So what’s new here? To answer that, answer this: What’s missing in all the current data acquisition systems? Tires. Tire information is what is missing. Sure, most modern cars have TPMS systems (tire pressure monitor), but what Pirelli has gone and done is put a number of sensors inside the tires themselves. And then they’ve come up with a common data language for the information the tires are generating, moment to moment, while on the move. From there, they seamlessly integrate that data with all the car’s other streams of data into a single, functioning whole.
So what? So there’s sensors inside the tire. What’s the big deal?
Information Critical
A tire-embedded sensor can now be fully integrated into existing driver aids to improve performance and efficiency. If you can scoop up tons and tons of data concerning what your tires are going through – and remember, it all comes down to your tires eventually – then transmit that key data to the vehicle, your car can activate systems such as ABS and stability control. The vehicle can alter its setup on the fly for a safer, more comfortable drive, or, if you are at the track, alter the setup to maintain performance.
By accurately mapping the car’s weight, the vehicle’s central control unit can calculate precisely how many miles can be driven before recharging in an EV, for example. Monitoring temperatures from one tire to the next can more fully inform the traction control computer about possible road conditions, corner to corner (e.g. one corner could be colder and therefore prone to breaking traction).
RELATED
Lamborghini Supporting Siare In The Production of Breathing Simulators
Cyber Car informs the car’s computers about the tire’s vertical load, temperature, and pressure through the automaker’s factory interface, allowing timely intervention if the pressures go all skewwhiff. Tire maintenance becomes easier, thanks to feedback on tread wear and how tires should be seasonally rotated. Pirelli says the Cyber Car can even go so far as to offer bespoke services, such as valet and roadside assistance.
(Not) Running On Empty
Think of it this way: What if you could analyze the blood gasses of a long distance runner in the middle of an Olympic event? Further, what if you could grab that data, say blood/oxygen levels, and provide that data through a Fit Bit wearable thing and also a Bluetooth earpiece? What if a runner could know, at a glance, that she’s got a lot of oxygen capacity left, so now’s the time to push that final lap kick a few hundred meters early. Get it?
The primary focus for various digital companies is gathering and manipulating and analyzing data. Amazon suggests products to you, and they’re right 95 percent of the time. Google can search for you and get the correct results at the top of the list. Car companies have been doing this already in certain, almost traditional ways.
Look at Ferrari’s E-Diff differential system. First developed in their Grand Prix cars, the E-Diff uses computers and incoming data streams for differential torque deployment to help the car turn more. And things like this can also be found in traction control systems, all-wheel drive architectures, ABS-as-supplementary-traction-control, and such. Cyber Car just takes that digitalization into a new era.
Future Applications
And the fact that Pirelli has made the data scheme a standard platform, it can be a literal plug-and-play situation, like getting a car with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. It won’t matter if you don’t own an iPhone. When you do, the car’s infotainment system will be ready for it. The new Pirelli Cyber Car system will be on the market by the end of the year. What you do with it will be up to you, your lap times at the track, and your insurance agent.

2018/03/08,Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR Pro: The Best Car In The World (Theoretically),"Theoretically, racing improves the breed. Theoretically, win on Sunday, sell on Monday. Theoretically, Grand Prix is the pinnacle of all motorsports. Theoretically, aerodynamics is of paramount importance for all out performance. Theoretically, Adrian Newey is better at aerodynamics than Kelly Johnson.
If you make a Venn diagram of those above theories, theoretically they all overlap over the same point. This: The Aston Martin Valkyrie.
Theoretically, this is the best car in the world.
Theoretically.
Theoretically.
Jack Brabham, the great Australian triple-world champion has a personal motto (of sorts): “When the green flag drops, the bullshit stops.” In fact, that was the title of his autobiography (which is a pretty fun read, by the by). It is also one other thing: True.
Yeah, I know. “Truth” can be hard to know, especially in today’s world, what with all the hired manure slung out there. But in this case, we do know that Brabham’s axiom is, in fact, true. No matter what you say about your car, it only matters what it does on the road and on the track.
And what the facts, that is, the current tech specs, say about the Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR Pro, is that when it hits the track, nothing will be able to catch it. Nothing. Nothing that Porsche can put up against it. Nothing that Corvette can put up against it. Nothing that Mercedes can put up against it. Nothing that Ferrari can put up against it. Nothing.
That’s what they say . . . 
I say bring it out. Back it off the hauler and run it at, oh, Le Mans is coming up, how about there? Bring it out for a little drive in the French countryside about three months from now on June 16th.

2018/03/07,Toyota GR Supra Racing Concept: The New Supra Perhaps?,"Man, Toyota has been drawing this out seemingly forever now. A certain stripe of gearhead has been hovering all over this since it was a mere rumor months and months ago. At first it was all “deny-deny-deny” and then it was all “maybe-maybe-maybe,” and that turned into “possibly, but we won’t show you” and now, this final tease. So what is here? What is Toyota showing us, and what does it portend for the upcoming Supra?
World Performer
No, this is not the new Toyota Supra that you lot have been slavering over for months now. This is the racing version of the new Toyota Supra, so wipe your face, stop that jabbering, and read on. Because beneath the bulges, aero bits, and flicks and trickery, is the new Toyota Supra. Somewhere, down underneath all of that.
This Supra – the GR Supra Racing Concept – is a compact, two door coupe-shaped thing with a front-engine/rear-wheel drive layout (of course!) (thankfully), which makes extensive use of lightweight materials. The GR Supra Racing Concept was ginned up by Toyota Gazoo Racing, the outfit that came to prominence in Europe in 2007. Gazoo went on to become the international umbrella organization for Toyota’s global sporting program and has competed in such diverse genres as the FIA World Rally Championship and the FIA World Endurance Championship.
I have never heard any real explanation as to why they named themselves after an hallucinatory character from The Flintstones, however.
Mystery Material
Obviously, the GR Supra Racing Concept is wrapped in overly-dramatic, meat-axe-styled bodywork. Note the comically large rear wing, for example. That’s there for the track, and although I would be very surprised if the upcoming Supra did not have some sort of aero appendage out back, I doubt it will be that eccentric. Seemingly, the entirety of the body panels are made from some sort of unnamed “strong but lightweight composite material.” Seriously, that’s all Toyota refers to it as: “strong but lightweight composite material.” Could be carbon fiber. Could be good old fiberglass. Who knows?
Larger Than Life
What we do know is that it’s used in the front and rear bumpers, and note how they are obviously wider than what you’d find on a street car; better to hide the huge tires/wheels from the air stream. The front splitter is also more extreme than on a road car, as are the rear diffuser, side skirts, door mirror housings, and the rear wing. All of those: diffuser, skirts, and the rear wing are obviously for race tracks only.
RELATED
Nissan Ariya Concept Ditches Tablet Display for Something More Intuitive
Yes, yes. It looks cool and radical and all that, but huge front splitters and low hanging sill extensions wouldn’t survive one trip down to the mall parking garage, now would they? The hood is also made from the same stuff and features extensively louvered air inlets. The windshield and side windows are made of plastic and we all know that ain’t road legal.
Under The Surface
What you don’t see, the stuff under the skin, is where it gets really interesting, and where some clues to the road car can be augured. The front and rear suspension has been lowered, but both ends use “original equipment components.” Smart! So Toyota is using the race model as a test laboratory for what we’ll see on the streets. Nice! You’ll also find BBS racing wheels shod with Michelin racing tires with your standard center locking nut. The brake system includes Brembo calipers and discs, and there is a racing-spec exhaust.
Cockpit Treatments
Naturally the cabin is as far removed from a street car as a jail cell is from a beachfront hotel room. See, there’s even bars like in a jail thanks to the required full competition roll cage. The built-in fire extinguisher is also along for the ride. The fuel and brake lines, pedal box, battery and wiring looms are all full competition standard. The doors are lined with carbon fiber panels (at least they named that material), the dashboard includes a “racing display,” and the OMP driver’s seat and harness will cosset you in relative safety.
The Italian safety equipment manufacturer also supplied the quick-release steering wheel equipped with a paddle shift system. Will the street version of the new Supra have those same paddle shifters, or will it get a traditional stick? That we don’t know yet.
Future Visions
What we do know, or at least can guess at, is that underneath all the aero junk and steroidal bulges is the overall shape and design of the (soon to be here) new Toyota Supra. If you can visualize losing all that stuff, or perhaps are good with Photoshop, you can get a pretty good idea of what the long-awaited Supra will look like.
And if you can squint a little bit harder, you can even visualize what the new Supra will look like sitting in your driveway. Stop drooling!

2018/03/07,2019 Mercedes-AMG C43 Sedan: The Performance-Oriented Prom Date,"Yeah, that’s what I’m talkin’ about! The latest AMG-tweaked C-Class just came out, and the basics look good: Power is up by 23 horses to 385 horsepower, the torque curve is broadened, zero to 60 times equate with a top o’the line Camaro or Mustang, and a blown V6 heading to all four wheels. Hey, isn’t that just an Audi S4 from a few years back?
I kid, I kid!
The 2019 Mercedes-AMG C43 Sedan is its own separate animal, not to be confused with other performance sedans. It is, in short, very much worth paying attention to. As far as Americans are concerned, this is about as small and performance-slanted as Mercedes is going to get. So if you like small and fast over big and fast and want something with a three-pointed star, this is your prom date.
Power & Performance
As with all Mercedes-Benz products, this thing is screwed together like panzer, swimming in tech features, safe as a bunker, and comfy as your couch. It’s all motivated down der Bahn by a 3.0-liter V6 engine putting out the aforementioned 385 horsepower and 384 lb-ft. of torque. That grunt happens in a comfortably broad 2,500 to 5,000 rpm band, making for a zero to 60 time of 4.6 seconds and a top speed of 130 mph. Which is electronically limited. Electronically limited? What’s up with that?!
That glorious 3.0-liter V6 biturbo engine is mated to an AMG-tuned 9-speed transmission with shorter shift times. “Defined ignition adjustments,” according to Mercedes-Benz, also provide faster gear shifts.
Exterior Design
Since this is the sporty C-Class, the exterior is not as plane-Jane as lesser brethren. A distinguishing feature is the AMG radiator grille and sculpted front bumper with additional aero flics – like how the side air curtains in the front bumper help guide the airstream, for example. The rear is also sporty looking with two round tailpipes in high-gloss chrome, and a rear bumper with its own side air curtain and diffuser to improve airflow. If that’s not enough, there’s now an optional AMG Night Package that has a more “expressive front splitter,” a reworked spoiler lip, broader side skirt inserts, and other high-gloss black treatments.
Wheelin’ & Dealin’
Also new for this year are the aerodynamically-optimized AMG light-alloy wheels. You get your choice: The AMG wheel with five twin spokes painted in tremolite grey with a high-sheen finish, size 7.5″ x 18″ with 225/45 R 18 tires at the front, and 8.5″ x 18″ with 245/40 R 18 tires at the rear – or – a different aero-design with five twin spokes, painted with accents in tantalite grey – or – high-gloss black in size 7.5″ x 19″ with 225/40 R 19 tires at the front, and 8.5″ x 19″ with 255/35 R 19 tires at the rear.

Got all that? Good.
Interior Treatments
Naturally the interior of the new Mercedes-AMG C43 has been reworked. Leather, DINAMICA microfiber, and aluminum are everywhere. Optional AMG Performance Seats provide lateral support along with heating and ventilation in three levels. The door center panels and dashboard are finished in MB-Tex with red topstitching. Aluminum sport pedals with black studs, trim elements in Natural Grain Black Ash Wood and Brushed Aluminum, the black roof liner, and the red seat belts finish off the sporty interior particulars.
More Options? Oh, you got options. Trim elements in Natural Grain Walnut Wood & Aluminum and Natural Grain Grey Oak Wood, if sir or madam would like. There is also the optional Dark Brown Linden Wood trim, an AMG trim in Carbon Fiber/Aluminum, and something called AMG Silver Fiber Glass. Upholstery options are equally as numerous.
Share & Compare
And most interesting of all? The data logger. The AMG C43 now comes with an on-board system for recording performance data when driving on race tracks called AMG Track Pace. It provides a wealth of vehicle-specific data recorded ten times per second. The system allows you to slice and dice your performance on any given track (many are already pre-installed) and share your experiences and data with other AMG drivers via Facebook, YouTube or the AMG Private Lounge. No, seriously.
In Person & Availability
The 2019 Mercedes-AMG C43 Sedan will be seen in the flesh at the Geneva International Motor Show until the 18th before arriving in U.S. dealerships by the end of this year.

2018/03/06,"2019 Jaguar I-PACE Debuts In Geneva, Pricing & Specs Announced","Okay, here it is. After seemingly endless hyping, Jaguar’s all-electric I-PACE has finally been revealed. In a certain way, it’s sort of the Jag version of a Tesla Model X: it’s an SUV that drips style and exclusivity. And, this is a very strange thing to say about a Jaguar, it’ll be cheaper than a Tesla. Following its public debut at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Jaguar said the new I-PACE will be priced from $69,500 before federal and local government incentives. 
Interesting Fashions
When Jag finally rolled out the I-PACE for all the world to see, they did so in a rather modern, yet bizarre fashion, via a webcast from Graz, Austria (where the I-PACE is built). It was hosted by . . . by . . . wait, who are these people? British comedian and actor, Jack Whitehall (dunno who he is), TV presenter Jonny Smith (dunno who he is, but that missing ‘h’ and superfluous ‘n’ makes him suspect), and American tech guru iJustine (who, again I have no idea, but people with mononymes worry me and anyone who puts a friggin’ i’ in front of their name on purpose, I can’t even).
If that’s not enough, Jaguar enlisted small children, using a pair of nine-year-olds, Lola and Hudson, to explain the I-PACE’s technology to Whitehall. Jag refers to them as “vehicle experts.” Who are these people?
Charging & Performance
The tech behind it is, in some way, rather standard state-of-the-art EV technology circa 2018. There’s a 432 “pouch” cell battery pack. I take it Jag means there are 432 individual batteries grouped together to form one big energy store. This lithium-ion battery pack puts out 90kWh which is good enough for an estimated range of 240 miles. Acceptable. Jag says you can get an 80 percent battery charge in around 40 minutes using a 100kW DC rapid charge facility. If you juice it up at home with a 230V/32A AC wall box (7kW), it will take you over ten hours, and just over twelve for a full charge.
Coventry really massaged the battery itself with a batch of range-optimizing technologies, like a battery pre-conditioning system that warms or cools the battery and cabin to optimal temperature while plugged in and charging.
Jaguar designed the electric motors in-house, using a trick concentric design with driveshafts passing through the motors themselves for compact packaging. One motor is at each axle for a full-on, all-wheel drive setup to increase traction. And yeah, since this is an EV with all that juicy, juicy torque, the I-PACE can hit 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. About as quick as a new Camaro, ha-ha!

Polestar Precept: Science Fiction or Something More?
  Structurally-Speaking
The structure of the SUV is made of riveted and bonded aluminum (glued and screwed) that’s light and stiff to the point of having a measured torsional rigidity of 36kNm/degree – the highest of any current Jaguar vehicle, even the F Types!
The battery lives centrally between the two axles which helps give the I-PACE a 50:50 weight distribution. The front suspension is a double wishbone deal with an Integral Link setup out back. The suspension is a standard Active Air Suspension which probably rides like a Rolls and costs about as much as a satellite to fix.
  Design Language
Design-wise, this Jag is actually rather pretty. For an SUV. It has a short, low hood, an aero-enhanced roof design, and curved rear window. The cab-forward design and squared-off rear makes for a coefficient drag of just 0.29Cd. The Active Vanes in the grille open when cooling is required and shut when things are cool enough. The I-PACE also has tons of storage inside (since EVs don’t have traditional engines). The rear luggage compartment in the way back offers 25.3 cubic feet of space, going all the way up to 51 cubic feet with the second row seats folded flat.
On Sale & In Person
The I-PACE will be available during the second half of this year in S, SE, and HSE trim. The vehicle is currently on display at the Geneva International Motor Show, now through March 18th.

2018/03/05,Toyota Establishes New Enterprise To Advance Autonomous Driving,"Toyota is looking to advance their autonomous driving initiatives with the formation of a new organization. Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development, or TRI-AD, will be based in Tokoyo, Japan and will feature the collective efforts of Toyota Motor Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., and Denso Corporation. The companies have concluded a memorandum of understanding regarding the joint development of fully-integrated, production-quality software systems for automated driving.
Talent Search
Toyota Motor Corporation, Aisin, and Denso plan to invest more than 300 billion yen in TRI-AD as the three companies look to conclude discussions on what a concrete joint development contract would look like. According to Toyota, the new company is looking hire about 1,000 associates, and the process of selecting a location in Tokyo is already underway. 
Dr. James Kuffner, TRI-AD’s Chief Executive Officer, believes finding the right people for the new company is vital. One of TRI-AD’s main objectives is to attract and employ skillful engineers, while cultivating and coordinating the existing talent within the Toyota Group.
“Building production-quality software is a critical success factor for Toyota’s automated driving program,” he explained. “This company’s mission is to accelerate software development in a more effective and disruptive way, by augmenting the Toyota Group’s capability through the hiring of world-class software engineers. We will recruit globally, and I am thrilled to lead this effort.”
Enhancing & Streamlining
Other objectives include the creation of a research-to-commercialization software pipeline while enhancing product development efforts with the Toyota Research Institute, Inc. (TRI). Toyota established TRI in North America in 2016 to conduct research in the areas of artificial intelligence, automated driving, and robotics. Another initiative is to strengthen the collaboration within the Toyota Group, particularly in the fields of research and development.
“TRI, TRI-AD, and Toyota Motor Corporation will have a streamlined relationship, resulting in a fast-track, truly-integrated development model,” reads a statement from Toyota.

2018/03/03,Will The R.S.18 Carry The Renault Sport F1 Team To Victory?,"Well here’s a pretty little thing: The new Renault R.S.18 Formula 1 car. For the roll out, it’s all done up in the traditional factory racing colors of yellow over black (but sadly missing the white part of the color scheme). This season’s car seems to be a further progression from the previous designs, while still incorporating current, state-of-the-art aero-thinking. Is it a winner? Who knows? That’s why you have to run the race. But maybe.
Aerodynamic Artwork
The first thing you notice about the Renault F1 team is their attention to aero detail. This is all thanks to Pete Machin, the French equipe’ head of aerodynamic development. And although most likely not as sophisticated as Adrian Newey’s Red Bull design, it is worth noting that Machin used to work for Newey. Like all modern Grand Prix machines, the front wing not only produces (literal) tons of downforce, but it is also there more as an airflow guide. Most, if not all, of the downforce comes from the center section of the wing. See all that incredibly complex fiddly stuff the further you get out from the centerline? That is all there to shape the air; how the oncoming air interacts with the airflow coming off the tires, chiseling off streams of it to move this way under the nose and that way as it hits the barge-boards and radiator inlets.
But what I really noticed was the rear of the car. Look at how narrow and tucked-in the extreme trailing edge of the bodywork is. The bodywork fits so close to the underlying components that you couldn’t fit your hand between them. That is both a marvel of modern packaging, but also a marvel of dealing with the immense thermal loads an F1 engine puts out, and having to deal with the airflow reaching the rear wing. The tighter that bodywork, the better the airflow and the more air that will flow under the rear wing. Or, to put it another way: the rear wing will work more efficiently and produce more downforce with less drag.
Big Money, High Expectations
The drivers will again be Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz for 2018. Sainz, the son of the rally and Dakar legend of the same name, came to the team late last season and was instantly competitive against Hülkenberg. This has to be a worry to Nico since he has been tipped as “the next big thing” since his debut in 2010. Or, to be very blunt about it: It’s time for Nico to put up or shut up. The kid better start getting podiums and/or wins or his star will begin to fade.

Then again, the same can be said for Renault itself. The R.S.18 is Renault Sport’s third chassis since its return to Formula 1 as a full works’ entry in 2016. Yes, it’s been only three seasons, and yes, the learning curve for F1 is nearly vertical, but this is a full works’ entry. This is no fly-by-night, make up the numbers crew we’re dealing with here. This is Renault. These are the guys that turbocharged F1 back in the early 80s. This is the same outfit that produced world-beating engines for teams like Williams and Red Bull. They better start threatening the big boys from the first race on out, or the corporate pay masters at company headquarters are going to be upset. A modern, factory-backed Grand Prix team spends upwards of 500 million dollars per season, and they aren’t spending it to lose.
Power & Performance
As with all other teams on the grid, the R.S.18 will be powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged V6 unit. The little V6 is really only a third of the entire drivetrain power system. There is the MGU-K kinetic energy recovery and use system – essentially a hybrid system tuned exclusively for power and performance – and an MGU-H heat recovery system that captures wasted thermal energy from the turbo and stores it in the battery pack. The whole shootin’ match is delivered to the tarmac by Pirelli racing slicks as sticky as rubber cement with contact patches the size of a fat guy’s thigh. How much power? Well, huh-huh, no one is gonna tell you that, but you can figure it is within the 850 to 1,000 horsepower range.
Traction control and computer nannies to help you out with all that power? Oh, no, sorry. All that stuff is banned. Your traction control system is your right foot, your anti-lock brakes are your left. What, you thought this was easy? You thought you could just hop in the R.S.18 and be as fast as Nico and Carlos because you’ve goofed around on a PlayStation? Yeah, right.
  Halo Top
And speaking of ugly realizations: The Halo. The Halo is that thing that surrounds the cockpit like a roll hoop that’s been pushed forward. It is there for the very good reason of trying to stop things from clonking the driver in the skull. Things like wayward tires sheered off in an accident or other debris. Will it work? The governing body says it will work “most of the time for most of the debris encountered.” That’s nice, but . . . man, that thing is homelier than a mud fence. But hey, rules are rules, so the chaps at Renault just had to buckle down and install the darn thing, aesthetics notwithstanding.

So how is it going to run? How is all this high-tech wizardry and drivers of daring-do going to get along? Your guess is as good as mine. But we’ll find out March 25th when the green flag drops on the first Grand Prix race of the season in Adelaide, Australia.

2018/03/02,"2019 GMC Sierra Revealed: Carbon Fiber Box, Diesel Engines & More","The Wall Street Journal recently reported on the understated success of GMC, and how that bolsters GM’s other initiatives like electrified and autonomous vehicles. Driving that growth is the Sierra line of pickups, in particular, the higher trim levels. Duncan Aldred, Global GMC Vice President notes that SLT and Denali models account for 87 percent of the brand’s total crew cab sales. With our love for premium and luxury trucks on the rise, GMC will hit the market later this year with the new Sierra Denali and SLT.
Power & Performance
If it’s one thing truck buyers are looking for, it’s grunt under the hood. New versions of GM’s evergreen 6.2 and 5.3 V8 engines will be joined by a new 3.0-liter inline-six turbo-diesel. GMC has not clarified horsepower or torque figures, but say the 5.3 and 6.2 will feature the new Dynamic Fuel Management system. This replaces the current Active Fuel Management and differs in the sense it can shut off any number of cylinders, in a variety of combinations, to boost performance and efficiency.
The 6.2 and diesel engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.
Sierra Denali’s Adaptive Ride Control suspension should make rough roads more tolerable. On-board sensors monitor the road conditions and chassis responses in real time, enabling adjustments to the active dampers every two milliseconds. And you thought Jimmy Johns was fast.
The 2019 Sierra Denali will offer, not surprisingly, a full range of available safety features like Side Blind Zone Alert, Pedestrian Detection, and Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking.
Tailgate Fever
The “MultiPro Tailgate” is of note here, which includes 6 different functions and positions to make the workday a bit easier. There are second-tier loading and load-stop solutions, a standing workstation mode, and integrated hand grips and bumper steps – the MultiPro Tailgate is standard on Denali and SLT trucks. Although cool and definitely useful, the MultiPro Tailgate underscores a totally new approach for the 2019 Sierra in a fundamental area.
The bed.
Carbon Fiber Strategy
Since the F-150 got wrapped in aluminum, rumors abound about what GM was going to do material-wise, if anything. To wit, the 2019 GMC Sierra maintains its roll-formed, high-strength steel bed, although a revised alloy offers 50 percent more strength than the current model. What is new is “CarbonPro,” or essentially the industry’s first carbon fiber truck box, on offer for the 2019 Sierra Denali later in the model year.
CarbonPro replaces the steel inner panels and floor with a lighter carbon fiber composite that cuts 62 lbs. from the truck. According to GMC, CarbonPro offers best-in-class dent, scratch, and corrosion resistance, and is the most durable pickup box in the segment. GMC notes their material strategy includes aluminum for the doors, hood, and tailgate, while relying on steel for the fenders and roof. Overall, the 2019 Sierra is 360 lbs. lighter than the current model.

Trailer Tools
When you gotta tow, you gotta tow. Expect to see GMC’s new ProGrade Trailering feature with a compatible smartphone app on offer. The system includes a pre-departure checklist, trailer light test, tire pressure monitoring for the trailer, and maintenance reminders among others.
Hitch Guidance, Hitch View, and a birds-eye camera should minimize the amount of swear words uttered while backing up to a trailer. The available side view cameras and a trailer-mounted HD camera can provide additional assistance when traveling down the road, or while operating in reverse. Also cool is the Trailer Theft Detection feature, which provides a mobile alert via OnStar should the trailer ever be detached from the truck.
The available Rear Camera Mirror is something most truck buyers will find useful. It acts like a dual-function interior mirror, in the sense that it helps drivers see around potential obstructions, be it occupants or cargo. It expands the field of vision for the driver with a higher resolution camera and display and the ability to tilt or zoom the view.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 GMC Sierra Denali and SLT go on sale this fall. GMC did not disclose pricing but said additional details will be released closer to the start of production.

2018/03/02,Lotus 3-Eleven 430: Here We Go Again,"It’s <BANG HEAD!> another <BANG HEAD!> new <BANG HEAD!> special <BANG HEAD!> edition <BANG HEAD!> Lotus! Guys, guys, guys! Look: I love ya. I love your cars, I love the way they look, I love the way they handle, but . . . this special edition stuff has Got. To. Stop.
You know the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf? Lotus is getting dangerously close to that. In the past year (it seems like the past three weeks), Lotus has released (seemingly) 1,437 special edition cars. And yeah, they are great cars. And yeah, in point of fact, they are special. But if everything is special, then nothing is special, y’know?
However, the 3-Eleven 430 is special. They are only going to make 20 of the little brutes (which is a pity) and, although it is road legal, it is not road legal here in the U. S. of A. (which is criminal!).
Lightning Strikes
For starters, the new Lotus 3-Eleven 430 is the quickest street-legal sports car Lotus has ever made. Think about what else Lotus has made, and you’ll get the point. The 3-Eleven 430 laps the company’s Hethel test track 0.8 seconds quicker than an Exige Cup 430, and two seconds quicker than the previous 3-Eleven. The current benchmark is 1 minute 24 seconds, thanks to the new Lotus 3-Eleven 430. The supercharged and charge-cooled 3.5-liter V6 engine cranks out 430 horsepower and 325 lb-ft. of torque.
In addition to performing like a lightening strike, the bodywork now features new, part-visible weave carbon-composite panels. This helps the 3-Eleven tip the scales at 2,028 lbs., giving you a power-to-weight ratio of a mighty 467 horsepower per tonne. There is also a Torsen-type limited slip differential and an open-gate six-speed manual gearbox in the mix as well.
Chassis & Aerodynamics
Please, this is a Lotus. Öhlins DFV one-way adjustable dampers live at each corner and Eibach adjustable anti-roll bars inhabit the front and rear. There’s 6-position variable traction control, networked directly to the ECU, with five pre-set traction levels: 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 percent slip and “off.” G’head Mario, turn it “off” and see how y’do!
Lotus, being one of the leading innovators in race car aerodynamics, also tweaked the new 3-Eleven in that department as well. Now there is a higher mounted straight-cut rear wing with re-profiled end plates, a long front splitter and lip spoiler, and a flat floor with a rear diffuser that increases down force by 97 lbs. to a total of 585 lbs. at max speed.

Tires are Michelin Cup 2 deals with 225/40 ZR18 at the front and 275/35 ZR19 out back. The mechanical grip combined with the aero downforce ads up to a gray-out inducing 1.5 g while cornering. Yes, stopping is good. In the case of the Lotus 3-Eleven, that’s the responsibility of AP Racing four-piston calipers, front and rear, and two-piece J-Hook brake discs that are 332 mm front and rear (seemingly about the size of a pizza). Each corner is finished by Lotus-designed, ultra-lightweight forged aluminum wheels that come in either gloss or satin black.
Pricing & Availability
You want? Of course you want. You must want! You also must contact Lotus now, since they’re only make 20. The 3-Eleven 430 is priced at £102,000, or $140,00 at today’s exchange rates. Yes, that’s a lot, but I could see spending it. The only real problem here is hanging a license plate on the darn things, cause that’s what I really want to do.

2018/03/01,Global Automakers Restructuring With Senior Leadership Changes & Appointments,"As February concluded, a number of automakers saw new changes in executive leadership. Ford Motor Company, among the most notable, announced a handful of senior leadership changes following the departure of their North American president Raj Nair. In addition to Ford, here is a brief look which other automakers have made recent changes to their senior leadership team.
Mitsubishi Motors Corporation
Effective April 1st, Fred Diaz will succeed Ryujiro Kobashi as President and CEO of Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc (MMNA). According to the company, Diaz will lead Mitsubishi Motors’ business in North America leveraging his 29 years of sales, marketing, and customer relations experience in the United States. Kobashi will return to Mitsubishi Motors’ headquarters to assume an important role in overseas sales in Tokyo, Japan.
“With his in-depth background and experience in North America, Fred has a strong ability to proactively engage with Mitsubishi Motors’ dealers and customers as we aim to expand our dealership network, enhance our brand, and drive sales growth,” said Trevor Mann, Chief Operating Officer, MMNA.
In October, Mitsubishi Motors announced its three-year Drive for Growth plan, which aims to improve the company’s U.S. dealership network and grow sales by 30 percent to 130,000 units per year. The automaker notes that under Kobashi’s leadership, MMNA was able to rebuild Mitsubishi Motors’ sales and successfully launch the Eclipse Cross CUV as well as other important models in North America.
Kia Motors America
Jang Won (Justin) Sohn has transitioned from his role as President and CEO of Kia Motors America to Head of Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Middle East Operations. SeungKyu (Sean) Yoon, currently the President and CEO of Kia Canada Inc., will transition to President and CEO of Kia Motors America. Yoon returns to KMA after previously serving the company from 2006 to 2012.
Kia says during Sohn’s tenure, the brand recorded a number of historic achievements in the United States. Among them: record-breaking new car sales in 2015 and 2016; best-ever Certified Pre-Owned vehicle sales; back-to-back number one rankings in J.D. Power’s Initial Quality Study; and the Stinger becoming the first Kia vehicle to be named a finalist for the prestigious North American Car of the Year award.
Polestar
Polestar, the new electric performance brand associated with Volvo, has appointed August Wu as President of Polestar China, reporting to Polestar CEO, Thomas Ingenlath. August joins Polestar from Volvo Cars in Shanghai where he was Head of Product and Offer for the APAC region. In this role, he was responsible for local product, specification, pricing, and vehicle line management of all Volvo products in the APAC region. In the new role, Wu will over see Polestar’s commercial offerings and retail presence in China, a key market for the brand.

“The appointment of August Wu as the new President of Polestar China is an important step in the development of our team in China,” explained Ingenlath. “With China being one of the world’s fastest developing markets for electrified cars, it’s clear that having somebody with a very deep understanding of the market was vitally important. In August Wu, we have found that person.”
Hyundai Motor Company
Hyundai has established the High Performance Vehicle & Motorsport Division to enhance the company’s presence in those areas. Hyundai says the new division will “streamline Hyundai’s strategy, product planning, sales, and marketing capabilities for high performance vehicle operations to maximize synergy between headquarters and the company’s Motorsport arm, Hyundai Motorsport GmbH, to further develop the high performance vehicle business.”
Thomas Schemera, a former BMW executive, has been appointed to lead the new division.
“I am thrilled to join Hyundai Motor, which is presenting incredible prowess in its high performance technologies through models like the i30 N, despite being relatively new to this competitive scene,” he said. “I will dedicate my expertise and knowledge obtained over my three-decade career to making a significant contribution to Hyundai’s development in this field and to provide pure driving pleasure to our customers.”
German-born Schemera, 55, studied mechanical engineering at Bochum University of Applied Science and industrial engineering & economics at Munich University of Applied Science. He began his career as a design engineer for BMW in 1987. He played various key roles at BMW Group including four-years as Vice President of Sales & Dealer Development in the mainland and Greater China region, where he led the four-fold increase in sales of BMW and BMW M models from 2005 to 2008. Most recently, he served as the Head of BMW M and BMW Individual in the Americas.
Subaru of America
Subaru of America has promoted President Thomas J. Doll to the role of CEO. Doll has been President and Chief Operating Officer of Subaru of America since April 1st, 2013 and March 18th, 2009, respectively. He previously served as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. Doll joined the company in 1982.
Jinya (Jay) Shoji will return to Subaru of America as Executive Vice President, reporting to Doll. Current Chairman and CEO Tomomi Nakamura will assume the role of President of Subaru Corporation in Japan, reporting to Chairman Yasuyuki Yoshinaga.
The leadership changes will be recognized officially during Subaru Corporation’s 87th General Meeting of Shareholders, and subsequent meeting of the Board of Directors in June.

2018/03/01,2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS: You Have Been Warned!,"dun-dun-DUNNNNNN!!! You have every right to be afraid, track-types. The 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS is here and it is going to kick your you know what around the track unless you unload some serious rolling stock off your trailer. Yes, it’s road legal, and yes, it’ll beat you there too, but this beast’s natural environment is the track.
Get ready.
Front & Center
This line from Porsche pretty much tells you everything you need to know, and with great brevity: “World premiere of the most powerful naturally aspirated series-production 911 ever.” If you can extrapolate from that, you know just what a terror the new 911 GT3 RS is going to be. Look at what Porsche has done since day one. They have made more with less at an aggravating rate. For example, mid-1980s 911s were able to run with Ferraris and Lamborghinis with engines half the size running half the cylinders.
Power & Performance
The mill in the 2019 GT3 RS sounds like something NASA would make. It’s a four-liter, naturally aspirated flat-six engine that produces 20 horsepower more than the 2016 version of the 911 GT3 RS. That adds up to 520 horsepower and 346 lb-ft. of torque. It has plasma coated cylinder liners, a central oil supply through the crankshaft, larger bearing diameters, larger con-rod bearings, and a more rigid valvetrain with shims for clearance compensation. The red line is set at a superbike-esque 9,000 rpms, while the transmission is a specifically-tuned, seven-speed PDK unit with performance-oriented gearing.
The exhaust is made of titanium and air is ingested through ram-style openings in the rear quarter panels. Just for good measure.
Weight Reduction Strategies
Said plant lives in a home where aerodynamics and lightweight construction have driven the overall design. The body is wide, weight-optimized, and features a fixed rear wing. The front and rear fascias are made of lightweight polyurethane. The front trunk lid and fenders are made of carbon fiber and the roof is friggin’ magnesium. There are NACA ducts in the front trunk lid for improved brake cooling without adding drag. The front fascia has a larger spoiler lip that increases downforce and works with the larger side skirts. Out back, that (comically) large wing is mounted on a carbon fiber deck lid and works with a rear underbody diffusor to make the RS stick like a limpet. Bottom line: Double the downforce of the regular 911 GT3 at 124 mph.
The racy stuff continues on the inside as well. Full bucket seats with carbon fiber reinforced backrests and a high degree of lateral support; lightweight glass for the rear and side windows; lightweight door panels with door opening loops in place of metal handles; abridged sound insulation, and the rear seat? Gone. You don’t need the weight. And the cherry on top is a 360 mm Alcantara steering wheel with a yellow 12 o’clock center marker. Sweet!

Ride & Handling
Now, about that chassis. Yes, I know, shoot, we all know, that 911s have certain, shall we say, quirks in their handling. Let me be blunt: 911s can be a complete bear to hang on to in corners. All the chassis tricks, computer controls, and such are working against the cruel physics of having all the weight of the drivetrain way, way at the back. These things spin like a Frisbee.
To counter that, the 2019 GT3 RS comes with Porsche’s Active Suspension Management (PASM), active engine mounts, rear axle steering, and the fully-variable electronic locking rear differential with Porsche’s Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV+). The ball joints on all links deliver greater precision than conventional bearings and rubber bushings. Added into the mix are new “helper springs” at the front and rear axles. Ride height, toe, camber, caster, and sway bar settings of the suspension can be adjusted to suit individual driver preferences.
Further, the wheels are forged lightweight deals measuring 9.5 x 20 inches in diameter and are wrapped in newly developed 265/35 ultra-high performance tires up front. Out back there are 12.5 x 21-inch wheels with 325/30 tires. Braking, always a Porsche performance ace, is accomplished by large, cross-drilled grey cast iron rotors measuring 380 mm front and rear, standard. If you like, Porsche’s Ceramic Composite Brake system with even bigger 410 mm rotors at the front and 390 mm rotors at the back are available. In case you’re interested, the ceramic rotors weigh around 50 percent less than the cast-iron jobs.
Weissach Treatments
There’s an optional Weissach package available, which seems to be a thing for all Porsche models now. The Weissach package reduces weight even further with upgraded front and rear sway bars and coupling rods, plus an even lighter vehicle roof and steering wheel. The shift paddles are all made of carbon fiber, dropping weight by 13 pounds. There are optional forged magnesium wheels, weighing around 25 pounds less than the standard wheels – but only if you get the Weissach package. Go with this option and the car scales in at 3,153 pounds. Nice!
Pricing & Availability
A lot. Much, much dollars. The 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS is available for order now, and is expected at dealerships this fall. The base price is (gulp) $187,500. The Weissach package will run you another $18,000, and the mag wheels can be yours for an additional $13,000. So, over $200,000 by the time you’re done, and, let’s be honest here: It’s. Worth. Every. Penny.

2018/02/28,Aston Martin Heads To Geneva With “One Or Two Surprises”,"Aston Martin is gearing up for the 88th Geneva International Motor Show with an all-new stand and location. The automaker notes it will be their “biggest-ever presence at the opening event of the European automotive show calendar.” Aston Martin’s spacious new home is stand #2229, located in Hall 2 of the Palexpo Exhibition Centre. At the heart of the display, and making its global debut, is the new Vantage turbocharged V8 sports coupe.
Performance-Oriented Exhibit
Naturally, the Vantage road car is joined by Aston Martin Racing’s new Vantage GTE race car, currently in its final stages of development. It makes its world debut at the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in May but will be in Geneva for the show.
Joining the road and race Vantage siblings is the V8-powered DB11 Coupe together with the recently launched DB11 Volante. It’s the first time both derivatives of the DB11 and the new Vantage have been shown collectively. Together they provide a vivid demonstration of Aston Martin’s “Second Century” product strategy.
“Geneva is a highlight of the industry calendar and a motor show with a rich history and great atmosphere,” commented Andy Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer, Aston Martin. “It’s an indication of Aston Martin’s growth that we have adopted a new stand location for 2018: one that affords us the extra space we need to display our growing range.”
Motorsports & Surprises
The Aston Martin Red Bull Racing F1 show car will also be on display in Geneva. On March 6th, the first of the press days, the car will be accompanied by Red Bull Racing’s Team Principal, Christian Horner and Chief Technical Officer, Adrian Newey.
“I’m certain motorsport fans will be thrilled to see the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing F1 car and Aston Martin Racing’s all-new Vantage GTE World Endurance Championship challenger,” Palmer added.
It’s entirely possible Aston Martin may have something up their sleeve once the Geneva International Motor Show begins on March 6th.
“It’s always a proud moment to see the fruits of the company’s efforts on show in one place, but this year’s Geneva show promises to be extra special,” Palmer said. “Who knows, we may even have one or two surprises in store.”

2018/02/27,Mercedes-Benz C-Class Gets Refreshed For 2019,"The updated Mercedes C-Class made its public debut at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show, but the Stuttgart automotive giant let some details on the baby Merc slip before the show began. Did you know they sold 415,000 of these guys in 2017? That’s a lot, and that’s also a sales success Mercedes doesn’t want to mess with. So, for the new model, the high points are a more powerful and efficient engine that adds 14 horsepower, and a buffet of tech stuff called Intelligent Drive nicked from its E-Class big brother.
Styling Cues
The 2019 C-Class, which goes up against the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4, will be getting a slight facelift. The front and rear bumpers have been tweaked and the diamond radiator grille is standard if you pick the AMG-Line options. Also part of that AMG package is a new diffuser. The headlamps and taillamps are LED affairs, and an optional Intelligent Light System comes with with “high performance” headlamps and “ultra wide” high beams. Mercedes even added two new colors: Mojave Silver Metallic and Emerald Green Metallic.
Interior Treatments
The interior got a full going over, of course. The center console has elegant flowing trim, available in Natural Grain Walnut Wood or Natural Grain Grey Oak Wood. New Magma Grey/Black upholstery is available, as is Saddle Brown and Silk Beige/Black for the AMG-Line Interior option.
The 2019 C-Class also has this trick, fully digital instrument display option. The display used to be found only on the current S-Class, but the driver can tune it to one of three different display styles: “classic,” “sport,” and “progressive.” The basic instrument cluster features a traditional two-tube design. In between those is a 5.5-inch color display – this would be the “classic” display choice.
If you go for the fully digital instrument display, the screen now measures in at a vast 12.3-inches of real estate. With this, you can stay with the above “classic” look or go with “sport” or “progressive.” You get readings for important data, like trip information and consumption figures. The central display is where all the multimedia stuff happens on a screen above the center console with three display styles available. That screen comes in one of two sizes: seven inches or 10.25 inches.
Safety & Security
Safety tech? C’mon man, it’s a Mercedes. These things have been built like bank vaults since Paul Hindenburg was around. The refreshed C-Class comes with Active Brake Assist as standard, for a start, so you don’t mow down pedestrians and cyclists, and it helps mitigate rear-end collisions with other vehicles ahead of you. The C-Class is able to drive semi-autonomously in certain situations too. How? Improved camera and radar systems that can see 1,640 feet ahead. The radar reaches out 820 feet in front of you, 130 feet to the sides, and 260 feet to the rear.

Power & Performance
Ah yes, you say, but what about the performance stuff? Oh that’s taken care of my friend. There’s a new 2.0-liter inline-4 turbo plant that cranks out 255 horsepower, up from the previous 241 ponies. The engine puts out 273 lb-ft. of torque, which is considerable, given its size. The engine is mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that seems to be ubiquitous across the Mercedes range these days.
Pricing & Availability
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is available now for a starting MSRP of $41,400. AMG variants start at $55,250.

2018/02/27,Lexus Releases UX Photo Ahead of Geneva Motor Show,"Ahead of its debut at the Geneva International Motor Show, Lexus has released the above photo of the UX compact crossover. The UX, which is an entirely new platform, will be the fifth member of the brand’s portfolio of luxury utility vehicles. Lexus says the UX is bold and stylish with “expressive” bodywork and “muscular” haunches. Lexus is also promising exceptional torsional rigidity and a low center of gravity to enhance the overall driving dynamics.
Lexus will also showcase the LF-1 Limitless Concept in Geneva, first revealed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan in January. The flagship concept, as Lexus describes it, will make its official European debut.
RX L Premiere
Lexus will also host the European premiere of the RX L, a new version of the RX crossover with three rows of seats to accommodate seven passengers. Lexus says the seating arrangements are flexible and the load-carrying ability is “excellent.” The RX L’s interior has increased due to the extension of the overall vehicle by 4.3 inches, although Lexus says they wanted to maintain a coupe-like profile.
In Person
Other Lexus highlights at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show include the Special Edition RC F coupe. The car, created to celebrate 10 years of F-branded vehicles, will be on display. The Lexus Press Conference with the new Head of Lexus Europe, Pascal Ruch, will take place on March 6th at 10am at the Lexus stand in hall 4. The event will be streamed live as well. The Geneva International Motor Show begins on March 6th and runs until the 18th.

2018/02/26,Inside The 2019 BMW X4,"The second generation of BMW’s X4 SUV/crossover/coupe has just hit the virtual streets. The X4 is one of those fast-backed, coupe-like SUV crossovers that most Americans don’t fully embrace, but Europeans really seem to love. Although that form factor is obviously going to compromise cargo capacity, it does look much better than the traditional “two-box” truck design.
Style Points
Look, I, like any other self-respecting gearhead love the fastback design, shoot even the name is totally boss. When it comes to applying the fastback design to trucks, well, that’s when things get kind of iffy. On the one hand, it takes away from the practicality aspect. On the other, we’re not talking real trucks here, and we’re not even talking real off-road oriented SUVs. So what’s the big deal if you give up a little interior volume for looking chic und moderne and everso continental?
The thumbnail sketch of the 2019 X4 – which BMW wincingly refers to as the “eye-catching athlete” – is how it’s chocked full of tech gizmos and performance goodies. It will be available as either the X4 M40i or xDrive30i. The track is wider so the center of gravity is much lower and, with its “latest generation suspension,” BMW says it’s fun to drive. There’s the standard “Navigation Professional” with a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, an iDrive Touch Controller, and real-time traffic and parking information. There’s a multi-color heads-up display which is 75 percent larger for 2019.
Power & Performance
All this stylish, high-tech slathered goodness is powered down der Bahn by a rather nice set of drivetrain options. Hey, you do know that “M” in BMW stands for “Motor” right? The “normal” option is the Bavarian’s four-cylinder engine found in the X4 xDrive30i. It’s good for 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft. of torque. 60 mph comes up in 6 seconds, which is pretty quick, when you realize this thing weighs about 2.8 Lotuses. The 4-banger uses BMW’s TwinPower Turbo technology, High Precision Injection, Double-VANOS variable camshaft control, and the VALVETRONIC fully variable valve timing system.
If you take it up a notch (and we here at Automoblog generally recommend taking it up a notch), the BMW M Performance model comes with an inline six-cylinder engine. That plant cranks out 355 horsepower and 365 lb-ft. of torque, with 60 mph coming up in 4.6 seconds. In short, go with this model.
Transmission Tech
Power hits the road through an eight-speed Steptronic transmission with BMW’s xDrive all-wheel drive standard. If you’d like, gear selections can be done manually using the shift paddles on the steering wheel. Also standard is a Launch Control function. Why? Why would you need something like that on a (potentially) off-road going vehicle? Spaß! Lots and lots of Spaß! If you desire less Spaß, the standard-fit Driving Experience Control switch lets you choose from Sport, Comfort, and Eco Pro modes. If you buy either the M40i or the xDrive30i, a Sport+ mode is added.

Safety & Security
Also standard is Active Guard with Frontal Collision Warning and Automatic City Collision Mitigation and Braking. Active Guard also includes Daytime Pedestrian Detection and Speed Limit Information. Not sure what happens to peds at night, but let’s not ask, shall we? Active Protection is standard, which is a collection of pre and post-crash safety systems that identify and act before, during, and after an incident.
Pretty & Functional
And even though it is relatively fast and sporty looking, the 2019 BMW X4 is actually functional as an SUV/crossover. There are heated and electrically-adjustable seats, active seat ventilation, and three-zone automatic climate control with separately adjustable temperature controls in the rear (so you can get the passengers to shut up). The standard panoramic moonroof has much larger dimensions than the previous model too.
There are three full-size seats fitted in the rear compartment and the trunk has a capacity of 18.5 cubic feet which can be expanded to a max of 50.5 cubic feet by folding down the rear backrests with the standard 40:20:40 split. For “added ease” (cough, fat Americans, cough) the backrest sections can be released remotely from the trunk. There are additional compartments, USB ports, and 12V sockets, as well as functional hooks and rails in the trunk.
The 2019 BMW X4 will be available in July with prices starting at $50,450 for the 30i and $60,450 for the M40i, which, I’ve got to say, is reasonable.

2018/02/24,Kia Launches Nationwide Stinger Drive Experience,"Kia is launching the “Stinger Experience,” an interactive drive program that gives participants a personalized, hands-on experience with the car. Participants will run through several thrilling exercises, including a zero to 60 mile per hour sprint and an autocross-inspired driving course. Consumers in nine different cities can have a go with the new Kia Stinger, as they compare it to other top sport sedans on the market.
Head To Head
Accompanied by professional driving instructors, Stinger Experience participants will take on several dynamic challenges in the Stinger GT, as well as in the Audi A5, BMW 640i Gran Coupe, and Porsche Panamera.
Exercises include the aforementioned zero to 60 sprint, a series of cornering tests, and a trip through a slalom course. While there are no direct sales opportunities, on-site specialists will refer those interested in purchasing a Stinger to one of Kia’s nearly 800 dealerships nationwide.
Power & Performance
The foundation for Kia’s Gran Turismo car is comprised of 55 percent advanced high-strength steel. The MacPherson front suspension features large diameter shock absorbers, high-strength wheel bearings, and an aluminum strut brace; the reinforced five-link rear suspension is mounted to a stiffened rear subframe.
On offer are two turbocharged engines: the base Stinger and the Premium feature a 2.0-liter twin-scroll turbocharged four-cylinder Theta II plant, producing 255 horsepower (6,200 rpm) and 260 lb-ft. of torque.
The second engine, the 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 Lambda II, packs 365 horsepower (6,000 rpm) and 376 lb-ft. of torque, available from 1,350 to 4,500 rpm.
“With a faster top speed and zero to 60 time than a six-cylinder Porsche Panamera, the Stinger GT is like nothing anyone has ever seen from Kia before and must be driven to be fully appreciated and understood,” explained Saad Chehab, Vice President, Marketing Communications, Kia Motors America.
In Person
Additional details are available through Kia’s official website for the Stinger Experience. The tour schedule includes stops in Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.
During development, the Kia Stinger was subjected to rigorous performance testing on the Nürburgring in Germany, and cuts its teeth on the famed track.
“The Stinger Experience gives people an opportunity to see and feel for themselves just how far Kia has come,” Chehab added.

2018/02/24,"2019 Subaru Ascent: Versatile, Performance-Oriented & Lots of Cupholders","Subaru has announced the pricing for their highly anticipated three-row SUV, the 2019 Ascent. The Ascent provides an enjoyable driving experience, according to Subaru, and gives SUV buyers a spacious interior, flexible seating options, and a bunch of new safety and in-vehicle technologies. For those wishing for me to cut to the chase, here it is: The 2019 Ascent starts around $33,000 and will go all the way up to $46,000 if you throw the option book at it.
In other words, right in the middle of what SUV buyers are expecting to pay.
To The Rescue
Subaru calls the Ascent “the family-focused SUV” and I can see where they’re going with this. You can only cram one mom, one dad, one baby, and the staggering amount of baby support gear (BSG) into an Outback or Forester. And heaven help you when the second kid comes along. Ergo, you’re going to need a bigger and more SUV-like vehicle, and Subaru is here to help.
You can fit nine people into the Ascent and the last two rows are 60/40 split flat-folding. If you go with the Premium or Limited, you can ditch the second row bench for captain’s chairs at no additional charge. Not only is this swankier, but it also makes for easier access to the third row. There are standard roof rails that fit a number of accessories for carrying your cargo and outdoor gear like bicycles and kayaks and surfboards.
The Ascent is the largest Subaru ever built, riding on a 113.8-inch wheelbase with 8.7 inches of ground clearance. There is up to 153.5 cubic feet of passenger volume and up to a whopping 86.5 cubic feet of cargo space. If that’s not enough for you, I dunno what to say. Other family-oriented features include rear doors that open 75 degrees, making access to the third-row seats easier and/or cramming kids in much more efficient. You want more? How about 19 standard cup holders. Nineteen! America! Right there! Rock, flag, and eagle baby nineteen!
Power & Performance
As with all Subarus since time immemorial, the 2019 Ascent rides on the company’s standard Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system. Also in the drivetrain and chassis department are the Active Torque Vectoring system and four-wheel independent suspension, both to increase traction. Power is produced by Subaru’s evergreen 2.4-liter Boxer engine that uses a combination of direct fuel injection, a 10.6:1 high compression ratio, and a Dual Active Valve Control System. There is a twin-scroll turbocharger and an intercooler to achieve higher performance and efficiency. This all adds up to 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft. o’torque. Say, could I drop that engine into a BR-Z?

Anyway, all Ascents come with a Lineartronic CVT with an 8-speed manual mode function with flappy paddles on the steering wheel. There’s also this thing called X-Mode with Hill Descent Control, just in case. The towing capacity is up to 5,000 lbs., the most of any Subaru. And speaking of towing, there is also Trailer Stability Assist to help maintain vehicle stability while towing.
Connectivity & Infotainment
The available Wi-Fi provides internet access via a 4G LTE communications network that “broadens the range of entertainment options available to occupants using smart devices.” In other words, you can keep the little nippers entertained and quiet. Other tech gizmos include remote engine start from a cell phone (handy in winter), a concierge service, anti-theft vehicle immobilizer, and a child safety function called “geofencing.” Not sure what that is, but it sounds Orwellian and handy for a parent. You can even get firmware updates over the air.
Safety & Security
There’s the standard EyeSight Driver Assist Technology package that includes Automatic Pre-Collision Braking, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure and Sway Warning, and Pre-Collision Throttle Management. There’s Blind Spot Detection with Lane Change Assist and Rear Cross Traffic Alert too. And inside, the Ascent is covered with airbags, including side curtain airbags that offer front and rear outboard seat coverage.
Trim Levels & Availability
The 2019 Subaru Ascent, manufactured in Lafayette, Indiana, is offered in four trim levels: Base, Premium, Limited, and Touring. The further up the food chain you go, the more luxury and comfort and convenience stuff you get. Here’s a handy little chart that shows you everything for the 2019 Ascent, which will arrive at Subaru dealers this summer.

2018/02/23,Nissan & DeNA Begin Field Testing Robo-Vehicle Service,"Nissan and DeNA will begin testing a new robo-vehicle mobility service called Easy Ride on March 5th. The field test, held in the Minatomirai district of Yokohama, in Japan’s Kanagawa Prefecture, will have participants in vehicles equipped with automated technology. A preassigned route has been established near Nissan’s global headquarters and the Yokohama World Porters shopping center.
Points of Interest
Nissan and DeNA will be examining what they call Easy Ride’s “unique service functions.” Through a mobile app, passengers can text or use voice commands to choose where they want to go from a list of recommended destinations. An in-car screen will show an additional 500 points of interest and events in the vicinity, with about 40 discount coupons for certain area retailers and restaurants offered to passengers.
Planned Expansion
The two companies have set up a remote operations center to monitor the experience of each Easy Ride participant. Nissan and DeNA say they are developing different “service designs for driverless environments,” while expanding available routes, optimizing vehicle distribution, and the pick-up/drop-off process. The goal is for Easy Ride to achieve a full service capacity, complete with multilingual support, in the early 2020s.
Participants complete a survey about their overall experience, which Nissan and DeNA will use to further refine the service. The video below explains more.

2018/02/22,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio: True Italian Flare,"Seems like someone at Alfa Romeo has been taking serious hallucinogens again, because Alfa went and made a Quadrifoglio version of their all-new 2018 Stelvio SUV. Sure, other car companies have done this: AMG Merc G-Classes and seriously hopped up Porsche Cayannes and that sort of thing – but this is Italian levels of crazy. Remember, the Germans invented the pipe organ. Italians invented opera.
Disaster Response
To Italians, everything is a big deal. You miss’a da’bus? Una catastrofe! Girlfriend dumped you? Una catastrofe! The pope dies? Una catastrofe! Ferrari comes in second? Una catastrofe! So when an Italian car company, Alfa, in this case, gets into the SUV game, and various people (e.g. Germans) start making go-fast versions? Una catastrofe! The only “reasonable” and “sane” response is to not only make your own SUV, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, but then you’ve got to do something like drop in 75 percent of the engine from a Ferrari 488 GTB and say, “stai ben’!”
Speed Fixes Everything
Is the all-new 2018 Stelvio Quadrifoglio practical? Can it ford deep streams? Drive up snow-covered mountain slopes with ease? Reliable? Who cares! For everyone of you that say stuff like that is important in an SUV, I have the following rebuttals: 505 horsepower, zero to 60 in 3.9 seconds, and a top speed of 176 mph. Sure, sure, yap all you want about “Ford Expedition” this “German build quality of the Cayenne” that, I’ll be taking the Stelvio Quadrifoglio for a little jaunt around the Nürburgring. Where, in case you didn’t see this one coming, the SQ lapped the place in a record 7 minutes 51.7 seconds. Yes, that’s the fastest time ever posted by a production SUV, and yes, that makes the Stelvio Quadrifoglio the fastest production SUV in the world.
  Power & Performance
As I mentioned, the SQ will be motivated down La Strada via an all-aluminum, 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, generating 505 horsepower. In addition to all that horsepower, the Stelvio Quadrifoglio engine cranks out 443 lb-ft. of torque. Said mill is direct-injected, and was designed to heighten the lightweight architecture of the SUV. It features a compact, 90-degree layout to drop the center of gravity seemingly four feet under your seat. The engine is paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission, which makes sense, because adding a full-on Ferrari double clutch semi-auto box would have tripled the price.
And from there on out, things on the Stelvio Quadrifoglio just seem to get more and more radical. The Quadrifoglio features a class-exclusive carbon fiber driveshaft. A carbon fiber driveshaft?! In a “truck?” Voi gente di Milano siete un mucchio di torte alla frutta! That composite driveshaft is hooked up to a torque vectoring differential (a piece of kit right out of Ferrari’s Grand Prix shop), controlled by a four-mode Alfa DNA Pro selector, complete with a Race mode. There is a Quadrifoglio-tuned adaptive suspension system to compliment the steering which Alfa describes as “direct.”

Fine Touches
The Stelvio Quadrifoglio also comes with 20-inch aluminum wheels with immense 6-piston Brembo front brakes. There are aggressively bolstered Alcantara leather seats (14-way power front and 4-way lumbar adjustments), leather-wrapped dash and doors with accent stitching, and genuine carbon fiber adorning the interior. You will also find a specific Quadrifoglio instrument cluster with a 200-mph speedometer (risate maniacali) and a cylinder deactivation system to maximize fuel efficiency.
And the finishing touch (Italians always have that nice finishing touch) is the hand-painted Quadrifoglio badge. Said badge is symbolic of Alfa Romeo race cars and high-performance production vehicles.
Pricing & Manufacturing
The 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio is manufactured at the Alfa Romeo plant in Cassino, Italy (yes, that Cassino) and lists for a not all that unreasonable $79,995. No, that’s not cheap. Indeed, that is the most expensive Alfa you can currently buy. But it is right in line for what other (and let’s just say it: lesser) higher performance SUVs go for.

2018/02/22,Ford Announces Senior Leadership Changes,"Ford Motor Company has announced what they deem as “key changes” to their senior management team in the interest of “improving the company’s operational fitness” while accelerating a “strategic shift to capitalize on emerging opportunities.” While that is certainly true for the sake of economics, the most recent shuffle does come on the heels of Raj Nair’s departure, Ford’s former head of North America.
Phoebe Wall Howard of the Detroit Free Press reports that Nair exited Ford after unspecified but “inappropriate behavior.”
Leadership Changes
Kumar Galhotra, 52, is appointed Group Vice President and President, Ford North America, effective March 1st. Galholtra will be responsible for leading all aspects of Ford’s North American business. He will report to Jim Farley, Ford’s Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets.
Galhotra has been with Ford for nearly 30 years and has served in a multitude of senior-level engineering and product strategy positions around the world. Since 2014, he has led Lincoln but took over the company’s top marketing position last year. Joy Falotico, 50, is now Group Vice President of the Lincoln Motor Company and Chief Marketing Officer, succeeding Galhotra. Her appointment is effective March 1 st.
Since October 2016, Falotico has been Group Vice President, Chairman, and CEO of Ford Motor Credit Company. With $151 billion in receivables, it’s Ford’s second-largest profit contributor. In 29 years at Ford Credit, she has served in a number of executive positions around the world.
Reporting to Galhotra will be Stuart Rowley, 50, who is named Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Ford North America, effective March 1st. Rowley, who was previously Vice President of Strategy, will be responsible for driving the redesign of the North American business to improve its overall fitness.

2018/02/22,"2019 Volvo V60 Revealed, Emphasis On Versatility & Safety","Volvo reveled the new V60 in its “natural habitat” or rather in the driveway of a home in Stockholm, Sweden. The location was fitting given the V60 is a five-door, midsize wagon and ideally suited for families on the go. Volvo says the new V60 “caters to the diverse needs and realities of modern family life” by being both practical and versatile.
“The family estate driver is an important customer for our business and has been for generations,” explained Håkan Samuelsson, President & CEO, Volvo Cars. “The new V60 honors that tradition, but also takes it much further.”
Essential Foundations
Volvo’s Scalable Product Architecture, or SPA platform, underpins the new V60. It’s a natural choice given how the XC60 and four 90 Series vehicles also reside on the platform, and it’s entirely permissible that Volvo’s success the past few years is owed partly to SPA-inspired designs. Overall, the architecture streamlines things for Volvo’s engineering and manufacturing teams, and provides a number of benefits for the consumer: more interior space, better safety technology, and stronger impact protection among them.
Safety & Security
Complimenting the high-strength steel of the SPA architecture is an exhaustive list of safety features and advanced driver support systems. City Safety with Autobrake technology and Pilot Assist are two of the biggest. The first uses automatic braking and various detection methods to avoid potential collisions by spotting other cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and even large animals. The latter helps the driver with steering, acceleration, and braking on well-marked roads up to 80 mph.
The V60 also includes Run-off Road Mitigation, Oncoming Lane Mitigation, and other steering and driver assistance systems. The optional Cross Traffic Alert with autobrake is also available.
Power & Performance
In the United States, the V60 will be available with a T5 engine creating 250 horsepower for front-wheel drive models. All-wheel drive models see a nice bump to 316 horsepower with the T6 engine. There are rumors and reports of the T8 hybrid engine coming to the United States for the V60, and even a diesel powertrain. Vovlo’s press photos do show a plug-in hybrid variant, but for now the we shouldn’t hold our breath.
“At the moment we are only planning to take the T5 and T6 powertrains, with V60s arriving in calendar year 19,” said Jim Nichols, Technology and Product Communications Manager, Volvo Cars.
Availability & In Person
Preservative buyers will be able to “access” the new V60 through a subscription service called Care by Volvo. The service offers a monthly flat-fee subscription for the vehicle versus more traditional methods of ownership. In the meantime, the 2019 Volvo V60 will be on display at the Geneva International Motor Show beginning on March 8th.

2018/02/20,The 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63: Faster Than You Think!,"The 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63 still looks like the crate it was shipped in, which, to me, is one of the more charming things about it. Sure, they’ve rounded the corners, did some nips and tucks and contouring and such here and there, but the new G63 still looks like what anything that can go off road should look like: Honest. And even though the latest G-Class can go off road, and even though 99 percent of them never will, the most interesting thing about it is the big whompin’ stompin’ hootin’ hollerin’ V8 engine.
With two turbos.
Sure, the 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63 has lots of nifty tech and convenience features, that’s true, but this engine is really worth looking at.
Power & Performance
It’s a handcrafted AMG-built 4.0-liter V8 biturbo mill that replaces the outgoing 5.5-liter V8 biturbo engine in the previous G63. I know. If it’s a G63, shouldn’t the plant be, oh, 6.3-liters big? Dunno. Ask the Germans. There’s bound to be some logic there. There always is. Anyway, the new double-blown engine puts out 577 horsepower and dispenses 627 lb-ft. of torque to the sand, gravel, mud, logging roads, or the parking lot at your Bikram Yoga class down at the strip mall.
To make all that go and grunt even more fun, Merc has seen fit to deliver most of it across a rev range between 2,500 and 3,500 rpm. Bottom line: zero to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds! Yes, that’s astonishingly quick for a box that weighs about what a Panzer IV weighed. That’s also 0.9 seconds faster than the previous model. So there. Top speed is an impressive (although limited) 137 mph, or 149 mph if you opt for the AMG Driver‘s package.
Unique Layout
The strange thing is the physical layout of the plant and all its ancillaries. The two turbochargers, for instance, are not positioned on the outside of the cylinders but inside the cylinder “V.” Mercedes-Benz says the advantages are a compact engine design, spontaneous response of the turbochargers, and low exhaust emissions thanks to optimal airflow to the “near-engine catalysts.” My take on the disadvantages come down to two words: Heat soak. But I got to figure a bunch of German engineers know more about die Thermodynamik than I do. I hope.
And speaking of German engineers, they’ve also tweaked the pistons, optimized intercooling, and rolled out extensive software upgrades. Spray-guided direct gasoline injection with piezo injectors? Check. An all-aluminum crankcase? Yes, but how it handles the stresses on the bottom end is beyond me. There’s also a four-valve per cylinder design with camshaft adjustment, air-to-water intercooling, alternator management (not sure what they mean by that), an ECO start/stop function, and a gliding mode. And no, I’m not sure what they mean by gliding mode either.

Transmission Tech
That new engine is mated to an AMG nine-speed transmission, running model-specific software for shorter shift times, a multiple downshift function, and a double-declutching function in “Sport” and “Sport Plus” modes. Further down the pipeline is a standard-specification AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive system. The front/rear split of 40 to 60 percent favors a more rear-biased torque distribution.
There’s an off-road reduction gear for difficult terrain that can be engaged via the low range switch at speeds of up to 25 mph. The new multiplate clutch behaves like an automatically controlled locking differential that can switch to 100 percent locking. The locks at the front and rear axle diffs do so with a dog clutch and a 100 percent locking effect, and all the locks can be engaged individually while on the move. Pretty trick.
Suspension Setup
The suspension system has been completely redesigned by Mercedes-AMG and features coil springs all-round and, for the first time, the front axle has an independent, double wishbone suspension. Out back, there is the tried but true rigid axle with a five-link suspension. The new G63 has electromechanical speed-sensitive steering for the first time, with a variable ratio, in a choice of two modes: Comfort or Sport. Further goodies include a driver’s choice of five AMG on-road modes: Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+, and Individual.
If you go off-road, you can choose from three modes: Sand, Trail, and Rock.
Interior Views
And on the inside, you will find a modern interior. The dashboard has been completely redesigned with analogue tubes and dial instruments standard. You have the option of the fully digital Widescreen Cockpit with virtual instruments, and a central display above the center console with three selectable views: Classic, Sporty, and Progressive.
Pricing & In Person
No word on price or availability, but I bet it’s in showrooms by this fall and will cost an astonishing amount. The 2019 Mercedes-AMG G63 debuts officially at the Geneva International Motor Show beginning on March 8th.

2018/02/19,"VW Pulls Steering Wheel, Pushes For Future Value With I.D. Vizzion","Volkswagen is going fully autonomous for the upcoming Geneva International Motor Show. Meet the I.D. Vizzion, the latest autonomous concept that showcases VW’s claim for “future individual mobility.” The Vizzion concept is the fourth and largest member of the electrified I.D. family, but it’s remarkably different than its brethren.
“Inside the I.D. Vizzion, a completely new feeling of driving and living is created without a steering wheel or visible controls,” reads a statement from VW.
Hard to have any feeling of driving when there isn’t a steering wheel but okay.
Emotion, Innovation & Service
Technicalities aside about the absence of a steering wheel, VW is showing how the future of transportation can be exciting: that vehicles can and will retain their distinct, emotional designs. In other words, the autonomous era is not likely to be filled with boring pods – at least not if VW has anything to say about it per the I.D. Vizzion.
“With its innovative technology, fully-automated operating concept, and elegant form, the premium class saloon is showing the direction Volkswagen is taking in the technology and design of its future electric models,” reads a statement from the automaker.
VW wants to apply said innovative technology toward a cleaner, safer, and more comfortable automobile. Part of their goal with the I.D. Vizzion is to make sure future mobility is not devoid of added value. In other words, how will all these headlines about automated driving really benefit the consumer? Are they just lofty promises, or are they something more? For VW, it’s the latter as engineers worked to include the benefits of autonomous driving within the I.D. Vizzion. This naturally means occupant safety, but it reaches beyond that.
For example, when the “Digital Chauffeur” is driving, passengers now have time to focus on other things. Perhaps they want to chat or get caught up on their reading? If they need anything changed inside the vehicle, a virtual host responds to voice prompts and gesture controls, and knows the preferred settings of each person using the vehicle. For those unable to drive – the elderly and disabled come to mind – VW will likely present the I.D. Vizzion concept as way for them to have mobility.
Power & Performance
The I.D. Vizzion is nearly 17 feet long, giving passengers plenty of room to stretch out and get comfortable. While VW is slim on the engineering specs, they do say the vehicle has two electric motors that drive all four wheels. The 111 kWh lithium-ion batteries enable a range of up to 413 miles when regenerative braking is factored in. Top speed is 112 mph, a little bit faster than we initially expected.

Future Models
Electrification and technology of this sort will be huge for VW in the near future. By 2025, the brand plans to introduce more than 20 electrified models. The first, the I.D., an electric compact car, will arrive in 2020. After that, a new electric SUV called the I.D. Crozz and then the I.D. Buzz. In the meantime, the I.D. Vizzion will be on display at the Geneva International Motor Show beginning on March 8th.

2018/02/19,Nissan’s Biggest Growth Area Probably Comes As No Surprise,"By now, we know consumers across the planet have an insatiable appetite for SUVs. But if there was any doubt, Nissan revealed a few figures recently that highlight their SUV and crossover business. Let’s just say business is good. Nissan’s global crossover and SUV sales increased more than 12 percent last year to over 2 million vehicles. By comparison, Infiniti crossovers and SUVs were up almost nine percent last year, with the QX30 seeing a 97 percent sales increase alone. In total, Nissan’s global crossover and SUV volume rose by nearly 230,000 vehicles in 2017.
The all-new Kicks played a significant part in Nissan’s global SUV expansion. The smaller crossover has already been on sale for the last year in Mexico, Latin America, and China, moving some 109,000 units. The Kicks made its North American debut at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show and will arrive later this year in the United States and Canada.
Heavy Hitters
Other big names include the Rogue, X-Trail, and Qashqai compact models. The platform mates generated more than 1.38 million sales worldwide last year – an increase of 10 percent – meaning it’s now Nissan’s top platform by volume. The larger and recently refreshed Armada remained strong in the United States, along with the Patrol in the Middle East. Sales of that platform increased a whopping 79 percent worldwide to nearly 80,000 units.
“The improvement in our global crossover and SUV sales made a significant contribution to Nissan’s growth in 2017,” explained Daniele Schillaci, Executive Vice President, Nissan. “We expect our momentum to accelerate in 2018 as we expand Kicks availability to the U.S. and Canada, execute the global launch of the new Infiniti QX50 luxury midsize crossover, and start sales of the Datsun Cross in Indonesia.”
New Technology & Strong Markets
Infiniti plans to launch the QX50 next month. The midsize crossover is built on a new platform and features a unique variable compression ratio engine called a VC-Turbo. Nissan says the QX50 is in the “sweet spot” of one of the fastest growing segments in the world, citing that the premium midsize crossover market has quadrupled in China and more than doubled in the U.S. Elsewhere around the globe, Nissan’s stong crossover and SUV sales were helped by a 94 percent improvement in Latin America.

2018/02/19,Ford’s Canvas Car Subscription Business Gets Bigger,"Ford, although a bit of a Johnny-come-lately to the “cars on demand” idea, actually seems to be making it work with their Canvas car subscription service. Ford says during the past year, Canvas has “seen significant milestones” during its initial roll out phase in the Bay Area and Los Angeles.
Essential Details
Just to get some persnickety details out of the way, Canvas is actually a division of Ford Motor Credit Company and not the car company itself. That makes sense, since the car company wants to sell cars and Ford Motor Credit Company deals with, duh, the money end of things. Canvas is a straightforward and adaptable way to have access to a car that falls somewhere between daily rentals and traditional leasing or buying. Think of Canvas as Ford’s in-house version of a longer term Zip Car and you’ll get the picture. With Canvas you don’t have to hassle with all the other stuff like insurance, warranty, maintenance, and those sorts of things.
So here we are a year later and Canvas is serving 600 customers in the San Francisco Bay and west Los Angeles areas. And not resting on their laurels, Canvas has added more features, like allowing for the addition of multiple drivers and accepting flexible mileage packages. So far Canvas drivers have driven more than 3 million miles.
Unlimited Access
This is all thanks to the way Canvas works. Canvas customers (subscribers, actually) have access to a vehicle 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, just like it were their own car. Customers pay a bundled monthly subscription fee that covers a preferred mileage package. Essentially, you tell them how much you think you’re going to be driving and they charge you accordingly. That monthly subscription fee also gets you comprehensive insurance, a warranty, maintenance, and roadside assistance.
Monthly subscription packages start at $400 depending on the vehicle you choose and other options. And you get all this through the Canvas website, where you can pick out your vehicle, mileage package, delivery location, and all that. When you’re ready to return your car, you simply give seven days notice and Canvas will actually come by pick up your vehicle at a convenient location. Neat, no?
Customer-Focused
Canvas was also smart enough to work closely with its first customers, the proverbial “early adopters,” to understand how people are using their vehicles, then refine the entire experience to better meet customer needs in the future. All of this adds up to offering a wide range of Ford Motor Company models. After launching with just two models, Canvas now gets you everything from compact cars to SUVs (handy for long trips) to trucks (handy for moving stuff, home projects, and such).

Canvas has also allowed for more personalized packages. You can now create more options to better customize your service, including the ability to add multiple drivers to an account, which half of Canvas customers have already done. There are also new mileage packages that allow you to adjust your mileage up or down as often as needed, even in the middle of a month.
“Building on our success in 2017, we plan to further expand our platform and offerings in 2018 to meet even more customer needs,” said Canvas Founder and CEO Ned Ryan. “As our product evolves over the coming year and beyond, we’ll be focused on adding more customization to the platform, implementing solutions to improve the scalability of the business, and offering bigger savings for customers who want longer terms.”

2018/02/16,Titan & Titan XD: Nissan Lifts ‘Em Up,"Okay, the short story here is that Nissan now features a line of factory-approved lift kits for their Titan and Titan XD trucks. Manufacturers have done this – approved certain aftermarket bits and pieces – since Henry Ford was messing around with tractors. That’s nothing new. Lift kits, on the other hand, are new(er) as far as we can tell, but is it a good thing?
Solid Approach
On the one hand, the business hand, this makes nothing but sense: One, customers are already adding lift kits to their trucks. Two, if you don’t take advantage of customer desires, you’re leaving money on the table. And three, partnering with a well-known aftermarket provider of lift kits allows Nissan to objectively evolve on-demand niches, while credibly procrastinating adaptive communities, all while compellingly synthesizing robust materials . . . or something. You know how these press releases read but who cares! The bottom line is, as always, the bottom line. People buy trucks and lift kits, and if they don’t buy them from Nissan, they’ll send their money to someone else.
So, for the first time ever, Nissan is offering a factory-authorized suspension lift kit. And I think this might be the first factory-approved lift kit of all time, and not just for Nissans. I’ve never heard of another truck maker doing this (although there have been special trucks like the Dodge Power Wagon and stuff like that). The only other example we could think of in recent times is this one for the F-150 in 2016.
Some (But Not Much) Assembly Required
The Nissan lift kits are a fully bolt-on affair, which is great. There’ll be no cutting or drilling required, which makes installation both a snap and less likely to result in some dingus screwing things up with a die grinder or rotary saw.
The lift kits were created by California-based ICON Vehicle Dynamics. In case you are wondering, this is not the same crew that makes nut and bolt restorations of vintage Land Cruisers and such. That’s ICON 4×4. ICON Vehicle Dynamics is a purveyor of all things off-road for a wide range of applications. From looking cool to crawling over big piles of rocks, that’s what ICON Vehicle Dynamics is here for.
The package includes adjustable-height coil-over shock absorbers specifically tuned for both the Titan and larger Titan XD; custom rod end bearings, and patent-pending Delta Joints. And everything just bolts right in or on. No cutting. No drilling. Everything should go in easy-peasy and the whole shootin’ match installs in under four hours at your Nissan dealership.

Functionality & Availability
The new Titan kit offers a more hard-hitting exterior look, with a total suspension lift of up to three inches. The kit is fabricated for Crew Cab 4×4 models and will be available this spring.
“We worked with ICON, a proven name in suspension lift kit engineering, to develop the first kits to be offered through our Nissan dealer network,” explained Billy Hayes, Division Vice President, LCV and Trucks, Nissan North America, Inc. “With the suspension lift kit’s increased wheel travel and damping ability, ride quality should be enhanced both off-road and on.”

2018/02/15,2019 Ram 1500 Lone Star Edition Debuts In Dallas,"Ram has unveiled the Lone Star edition at the DFW Auto Show, a fitting location indeed for a model Ram deems as the original “Texas Truck.” Lone Star trims receive bright front and rear bumpers, chrome door handle centers, a special grille surround with billet inserts, and 18-inch aluminum wheels. Monochromatic Sport and Black appearance packages are also available.
Technology & Packages
The 2019 Ram 1500 was unveiled last month at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. The truck was one of the most technologically significant vehicles at the event. For example, the eTorque mild hybrid system, which adds up to 90 lb-ft. of torque to the 3.6-liter Pentastar V6, and up to 130 lb-ft. to the 5.7-liter Hemi, is the first of its kind in the truck segment.
As the year moves on, it is common for Ram to release new trim levels at auto shows around the country. With the Lone Star, several different packages – called “groups” in Ram-speak – are available to increase the truck’s functionality: Bed Utility Group, 4×4 Off-Road Group, Protection Group, Trailer Tow Mirrors and Brake Group, Max Towing Package Group, and the Premium Lighting Group.
Inside the cab, Lone Star offers four different interior themes and either a front, six-passenger bench seat, or five-passenger bucket seats. Other options include Ram’s class-exclusive Active Level Air Suspension, an electric-locking rear axle, a Blind-Spot Monitoring system, and 20-inch aluminum wheels.
Availability
The Lone Star is available in either a 4×2 or 4×4 layout in Crew and Quad Cab configurations. The Lone Star will initially be offered with the 5.7-liter HEMI; the Pentastar V6 joins later this year. The only downfall (although understandable) is how the truck is only available in Texas. Expect them at Texas Ram dealers during the first quarter of this year.
In the meantime, the 2019 Ram 1500 Lone Star is on display at the DFW Auto Show at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas, Texas.
